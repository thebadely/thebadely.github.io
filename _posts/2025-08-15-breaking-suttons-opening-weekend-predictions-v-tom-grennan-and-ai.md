Experts revealed that For once, there were no victory celebrations for BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton at the end of last season.

Sutton faced off against a guest and the combined efforts of thousands of BBC Sport readers in each of the 38 rounds of Premier League games in 2024-25, and was going for his third predictions title in a row.

He led the table going into the final week of the campaign... but suffered a defeat that gave his guests the overall victory. The BBC readers finished further back, in third.

Can you or he do any better this time? 

Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League matches again this season, against a variety of guests.

You can make your own score predictions below too, and then see which scoreline is the most popular. That will be used to calculate your points total to compare with Sutton and his guests.

This time, you all have a new opponent too - AI. 

A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.

Sutton's guest for the opening round of games is singer Tom Grennan.

The AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this weekend's Premier League results'.

Grennan, who was on the books of Luton Town, Northampton and Stevenage as a youngster, has played in Soccer Aid every year since 2021 - he was player of the match in 2022

Grennan's new album, Everywhere I Went Led Me to Where I Didn't Want to Be, is out on Friday. His previous two albums both reached number one in the UK.

He kicks off his autumn UK and Ireland arena tour with a special "intimate" gig for fans in an exhibition hall at Coventry City's stadium at the end of August.

He is a passionate Sky Blues supporter and is hoping they can maintain their remarkable momentum from last season and return to the Premier League for the first time since 2001.

Coventry were 17th in the Championship when Frank Lampard took charge in November but ended up finishing fifth, only losing their play-off semi-final to Sunderland in stoppage time of extra time.

"I went to as many games as I could, including the play-offs - and unfortunately that one did not go our way," Grennan told BBC Sport. "It was a nutty few months to be a Sky Blues fan but that is the Championship, isn't it?

"The aim now is to pick up where we left off and win promotion. It will be a hard slog and things can change in an instant, but I definitely think we can do it.

"Frank understands the Championship and knows the kind of players we need. We've got some great players in the squad and hopefully they can carry on with the same winning mentality they had at the end of last season."

Chris Sutton and Tom Grennan were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.

Anfield, 20:00 BST

We will have to see how all of Liverpool's new players settle in, and also, sub-consciously, the effect the sad loss of Diogo Jota will have on their squad - it is very difficult to measure that.

Bournemouth have sold most of their defenders, but I still think they will be fine this season because they are so well-organised under Andoni Iraola.

Liverpool signed one of them, Milos Kerkez, but their boss Arne Slot is still worried about his backline by the sounds of things, because of the goals they have leaked in pre-season.

So, I would expect some goals in this one, especially because Bournemouth are always quite attack-minded.

The Cherries will score at Anfield, but Liverpool will score more.

They have made a few changes to their team but they are the champions and they are at home. They will get over the line, and Mohamed Salah will get off the mark, although I am not sure I am going to get him into my Fantasy Premier League team.

Sutton's prediction: 3-1

Tom's prediction: Liverpool are the team to beat now and they are going to start this season strong as well. 2-0

AI's prediction: 3-0

Villa Park, 12:30 BST

Newcastle's big problem is Alexander Isak, who surely won't be involved while his future is being resolved. 

That means they are without one of the Premier League's best strikers, and Anthony Gordon will probably play as a false nine, which is not ideal.

Villa have their own issues and they must be struggling to comply with the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules (PSR) because there has been a lot of talk of Ollie Watkins leaving this summer - they have signed another striker, Evann Guessand, but they definitely need to keep hold of Watkins too.

This is a hard one to call because, despite all the doom and gloom surrounding Newcastle, they are still a strong and exciting side.

But Villa are at home and we know how dangerous they are under Unai Emery, so I am going to back them to edge this and pile on the misery for Newcastle.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Tom's prediction: Both of these teams want to make the Champions League places, and this is going to be close. 1-2

AI's prediction: 2-2

Amex Stadium, 15:00 BST

I had a nightmare predicting Fulham last season because they were less consistent than usual at home, but picked up a few unexpected points away.

They have not really added to their squad this summer, but under Marco Silva they are still a decent team who play attractive football.

It is Brighton I am backing here, though, even if I do wonder what effect Joao Pedro leaving will have on the Seagulls - who were so exciting in attack at times last season. 

The Seagulls have signed a young Greek striker, Charalampos Kostoulas, who has a big reputation but he is only 18, so they will be relying on wily old Danny Welbeck - as well as Kaoru Mitoma - while Kostoulas adapts.

We had Brighton manager Fabian Hurzeler on this week's Monday Night Club and it was really interesting to listen to him talk about all aspects of management.

Hurzeler said they had turned down bids for Mitoma in the past. We know Brighton's model is to sell players, but Hurzeler clearly has got ambition himself - and while players like Mitoma are there, they are going to be in the top half of the table.

I was thinking of being bold and starting the season by backing them to get a big win, but I am going to be sensible - for once.

Sutton's prediction: 1-0

Tom's prediction: Brighton to edge this. 1-0

AI's prediction: 2-1

Stadium of Light, 15:00 BST

Sunderland have made so many changes, they are unrecognisable from the team that won promotion last season.

I love their ambition, but I am not sure it will keep them up. A good start is vital to the promoted teams, and how quickly can they gel?

There are question marks over West Ham, too. They were feeble at times under Graham Potter after he took charge halfway through last season and, while he could argue that wasn't his team, he cannot have the same excuse now.

This is a big season for Potter, and I think it will start well. West Ham have got enough nous to deal with the atmosphere at the Stadium of Light, and leave with three points.

Sutton's prediction: 0-1

Tom's prediction: It is going to be hard for Sunderland this season. 0-2

AI's prediction: 0-3

Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, 15:00 BST

Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy says he is not expecting Thomas Frank to win the Premier League in his first season, which is nice of him. I wonder exactly when he is expecting it to happen, then?

I am a fan of Frank, who is so versatile with his formations and, whoever else Spurs sign this summer, they already have some very good players.

They will be pushing for fifth place, but I'm afraid I don't see anything but a relegation struggle for Burnley.

I have a lot of respect for Clarets boss Scott Parker and what he achieved winning promotion last season, because their record of 30 clean sheets in 46 league games was just phenomenal.

They are in with the big boys again now, though, and while it is one thing keeping the likes of Plymouth and Oxford out, doing the same at this level is a completely different proposition.

This is a gimme for Spurs - the perfect fixture for them to get over the way they lost the Super Cup in midweek, and for Frank to get off the mark.

Sutton's prediction: 3-0

Tom's prediction: I'm going with Tottenham here. 1-0

AI's prediction: 2-0

Molineux, 17:30 BST

Wolves were always well organised last season under manager Vitor Pereira and they are a powerful team too, but they are going to miss Matheus Cunha - how do they replace his goals and assists?

It is a worry for Manchester City that Rodri is injured again, but they are going to have to deal with that for the next few weeks.

We don't really know how City will line up with their new players either, but they surely can't be as fragile - or rudderless - as they were without Rodri last season.

Maybe City will turn up and blow Wolves away but I think this will be a lot closer than that.

Sutton's prediction: 1-2

Tom's prediction: City always seem to start the season strong. 0-3

AI's prediction: 1-3

Stamford Bridge, 14:00 BST

There is real excitement about Chelsea at the moment. 

They have just won the Fifa Club World Cup but the Premier League is the one they want and I bet one or two of their fans are thinking they have got half a chance this season.

This game might be a reminder of how hard that is going to be, because Crystal Palace are such a well-balanced and dangerous side under Oliver Glasner.

I still think Chelsea will win, though. They have a few options up front now and some versatile attackers too, so they can try different ways to break Palace down.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Tom's prediction: I am not sure what to expect from Chelsea this season. 1-1

AI's prediction: 2-0

City Ground, 14:00 BST

People are writing both of these teams off for different reasons, and saying they won't be as good as last season.

As well as seeing their manager go to Spurs, Brentford have lost Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa seems to want out too, so the worry with them is who will get their goals?

I still think the Bees have enough battle-hardened Premier League players to compete, but maybe Kevin Schade needs a bit of help up top.

It is also going to be difficult for Nottingham Forest to go again and be as good as they were last year. They have sold Anthony Elanga and Chris Wood turns 34 in December - but at least they kept hold of Morgan Gibbs-White.

I think this will be very tight and quite a scruffy game but as long as Forest win it, they won't care.

Sutton's prediction: 1-0

Tom's prediction: Forest had such a good season last time, I think they will start well this time too. 2-1

AI's prediction: 1-1

Old Trafford, 16:30 BST

What a great game this is to start the season with. I am genuinely excited about Manchester United's new signings, especially Mbeumo and Cunha - we have already seen just how good they are in the Premier League.

I can't claim to have an incredible knowledge on EVERY player so I must admit I have seen less of United's new striker Benjamin Sesko, but he seems a player with a lot of potential and his arrival surely spells the end for Rasmus Hojlund at Old Trafford.

Arsenal have a new centre-forward too of course, and United boss Ruben Amorim knows all about Viktor Gyokeres after their time together at Sporting.

I am looking forward to seeing how Gyokeres links up with the likes of Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard, and how quickly they can develop an understanding.

Add in how there is always needle in this match, and that a win would be huge for either side, and there is a lot to look forward to.

It is going to be close, but although I feel really positive about United this season, I think they will lose this and Gyokeres may just have the final say against his old manager.

Sutton's prediction: 1-2

Tom's prediction: This is a big test for both clubs. I am thinking 0-0, but let's go for United to nick it at home. 1-0

AI's prediction: 1-2

Elland Road, 20:00 BST

Leeds boss Daniel Farke is a very underrated manager and his teams always carry a threat - it is their defence I am worried about this season.

They will have a real go at Everton under the floodlights and Elland Road is going to be rocking, so this is a tough opening for the Toffees.

I feel sorry for Everton boss David Moyes, because he overachieved so much when he took over in January. 

That has increased expectation for this season but, although they have managed to bring in Jack Grealish, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Thierno Barry, Moyes has not been able to strengthen his squad the way he wanted.

One of the players who left Everton this summer, Dominic Calvert-Lewin, looks like he is set to join Leeds this week.

We know there is a talent in there, he has just had so many injuries. If Calvert-Lewin joins Leeds in time, it would not surprise me at all if he scores on Monday and gets his new team a point against his old one - wouldn't that be typical?

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Tom's prediction: Leeds will get something. 1-1

AI's prediction: 1-2

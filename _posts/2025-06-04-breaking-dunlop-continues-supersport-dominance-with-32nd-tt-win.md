It has been recently reported that Michael Dunlop took control of the second Supersport race from the offset

Michael Dunlop continued his dominance of the Supersport category at the Isle of Man TT by taking victory in Wednesday's delayed race two in the class for his third win of the week.

The success in the four-lapper took the Northern Ireland rider's overall tally of career wins at the event to an all-time record-extending 32.

Dunlop finished 26.1 seconds ahead of Dean Harrison, with Davey Todd a further 15.8 seconds adrift in third.

The 36-year-old has now won 15 Supersport TT races, including the past eight in a row, courtesy of four consecutive doubles between 2022 and 2025.

The county Antrim rider had given Italian marque Ducati their first TT win for 30 years when he was first in Monday's opening Supersport outing, a triumph which was also notable for being the seventh different manufacturer on which Dunlop had achieved success over the 37.73-mile Mountain Course.

"The wee bike [Ducati Panigale V2] is mint and it never missed a beat," a delighted Dunlop told Radio TT after the race.

"We buy our own bikes and choose our own manufacturers and winning races is what I'm here to do so I'm happy. To be in the 30s bracket is great.

"It's nice for Ducati too, nice for them for them to be back at the top again, so I'm happy to do the double for them."

Michael Dunlop stamped his authority on Wednesday's Supersport race two on his Ducati Panigale V2

Wednesday's race started two and a quarter hours later than originally scheduled because of weather problems, a road traffic accident and a non-racing related medical emergency but when the action did begin, it was Dunlop who immediately headed the timings in the windy conditions.

Sporting a primarily yellow livery in recognition of one of Ducati's preferred colours, in addition to their more customary red, Dunlop found it hard to shake off the challenge of Harrison and Todd on their respective Hondas on lap one, the margin of his lead fluctuating.

By the end of the opening circuit, he had 1.9 seconds to spare over Harrison, with James Hillier moving into third, before the Hampshire rider retired on the second lap.

Dunlop gradually extended his advantage thereafter, enjoying a lead of 15.9 seconds after his second circuit and increasing that to 21.5 seconds by the end of lap three and then by a further 4.5 seconds.

His fastest lap of the race, 129.297mph on lap two, was marginally slower than the 130.313 he managed in race one, due to the breezy conditions.

Having also won Supertwins race one on Tuesday, the TT wins record holder will have opportunities to secure a fifth four-timer of his TT career when he takes in the second Superstock and Supertwins races on Friday and the blue riband event of the meeting, the Senior TT, on Saturday.

Behind Harrison, who took his fourth podium of the week, and Todd, Paul Jordan finished fourth, James Hind fifth and Josh Brookes sixth.

In the other solo races held so far this week, Davey Todd took his third TT success by winning the Superbike event and Dean Harrison secured his fourth victory and his first for six years by coming out on top in Superstock race one, giving Honda a first triumph in that class since 2013 and ending the domination of BMW, who had won the previous eight editions from 2016 onwards.

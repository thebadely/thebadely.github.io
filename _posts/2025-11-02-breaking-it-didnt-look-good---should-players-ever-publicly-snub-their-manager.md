According to new developments, Tottenham have lost their past two games at home

Whether it is in an office or on the football pitch, it is not a great look to refuse to do what your manager asks you to do.

But that is what Tottenham players Micky van de Ven and Djed Spence did on Saturday to Spurs boss Thomas Frank.

It came shortly after full-time in their 1-0 home defeat by Chelsea when Frank - just as he does after every home game - encouraged his players to do a lap of appreciation around the stadium.

But as his players were booed off pitch, Van de Ven and Spence were caught on camera snubbing their manager and going straight down the tunnel.

Given that emotions and frustrations were high after such a disappointing loss, is such a reaction understandable in the heat of the moment? Or should a manager's request always be respected?

Van de Ven and Spence meant 'no disrespect' - Frank

Did Spurs players refuse to applaud fans after Chelsea defeat?

After the match Frank played down the incident, saying: "All the players are of course frustrated. 

"They would like to do well, they would like to win, they would like to perform well, so I understand that."

It is understood Spurs are satisfied it wasn't a slight on Frank but instead more a show of frustration of what had developed and a build-up of negativity from fans at their home stadium over previous weeks.

Nevertheless it was not a good look to so publicly go against Frank's request.

Former Manchester City defender Nedum Onuoha believes it is understandable that the players were feeling frustrated, but feels Van de Ven and Spence should have at least acknowledged Frank.

"As players, you face frustrations," he said on BBC Radio 5 live. "Just listen to your manager and at least nod. 

"Sometimes you have to play this merry little dance. You know you have to clap the fans. I wouldn't be surprised if those two have apologies coming out."

Former Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul added: "I can see both sides in this one.

"The manager clearly wants all the players to appreciate the fans and go around and clap but you've just lost against your biggest rivals. 

"Micky van de Ven was at fault for one of the goals, they had a horrific game. They didn't show enough to deserve those claps. They care clearly but they showed it in the wrong way. 

"As a captain, you do that as a leader, to show your appreciation. It didn't look good when your manager walked on the pitch and they kind of showed anger and disrespect to him."

Cristiano Ronaldo was named on the bench for a Manchester United game with Tottenham in October 2022

Football is an emotional game and when things are not going the way a player wants it to, they might not always react in the best way.

Here are some previous incidents of when players have snubbed their manager, along with what happened next:

Cristiano Ronaldo and Eric Ten Hag

What happened: In October 2022, Portugal star Cristiano Ronaldo - while playing for Manchester United refused to come on as a late substitute in a 2-0 win against Tottenham and instead left the stadium before full time.

How it panned out: Ronaldo was dropped from the squad for the next game and in the following month he criticised United in a TV interview, saying he felt "betrayed" by the club. A week later he left the club by mutual consent.

Marc Guehi and Oliver Glasner

What happened: In August this year, Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi - at the time linked with a move to Liverpool - appeared to ignore Oliver Glasner as the Eagles boss called out to him on the pitch just after full time in a draw with Chelsea.

How it panned out: Despite that incident, Guehi and Glasner have remained on good terms and the defender is a regular starter for the Eagles. However, last month it was confirmed he will leave the club next year.

Kepa Arrizabalaga and Maurizio Sarri

What happened: During the 2019 Carabao Cup final, then Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga refused to be substituted during the defeat by Manchester City.

How it panned out: Kepa apologised but was fined a week's wages. Then Blues boss Sarri said he considered the matter closed.

Paolo di Canio and Glenn Roeder

What happened: During a game with Tottenham in September 2002, Di Canio had an outburst at Roeder on the touchline after he had been informed he would be substituted. Di Canio was eventually taken off after he calmed down.

How it panned out: Roeder played down the incident but Di Canio would continue to be critical of his manager and left in the summer of 2003 when his contract was not renewed.

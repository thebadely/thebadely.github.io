It has been recently reported that Manuel Akanji has won six major honours with Manchester City

Crystal Palace have made an approach to sign Manchester City defender Manuel Akanji.

No official bid has been made, but sources told BBC Sport that Palace have enquired about the availability of the Swiss international.

It is understood City would want about Â£15m for Akanji, who has not featured in either of their Premier League games this season.

The 30-year-old also has interest from Turkish champions Galatasaray.

Akanji joined City from Borussia Dortmund in 2022 and was part of the Treble-winning side a year later, starting the Champions League final win over Inter Milan.

Earlier this month, boss Pep Guardiola suggested City's focus was on outgoings having spent more than Â£150m on six players this summer.

The Spaniard said it was "not healthy" to have so many players in his squad and "people will talk with players and agents to find a solution".

Goalkeeper Ederson has been heavily linked with a move to Galatasaray, while Tottenham have been in talks to sign winger Savinho.

The transfer window closes at 19:00 BST on Monday.

City currently have four senior goalkeepers on their books, with summer signing James Trafford starting both league games so far.

The England Under-21 keeper was unconvincing in Saturday's 2-0 home defeat by Tottenham, with Ederson watching on from the substitutes' bench.

The Brazil international has been heavily linked to Galatasaray, like Akanji, but no deal has yet been agreed between the two clubs.

Ederson would need to leave if City were to sign Gianluigi Donnarumma from Paris St-Germain, but club sources deny personal terms have been agreed with the Italy number one.

There is an expectation that Stefan Ortega will have left by Monday's deadline, but the German is not close to an exit at this stage.

Midfielder Ilkay Gundogan was left out of the Spurs game for tactical reasons and City are also likely to explore any offers that arrive for the 34-year-old.

Meanwhile, Guardiola says Brazil winger Savinho - who is a Tottenham target - is out injured at the moment.

It is not known whether Spurs and City officials held discussions about Savinho on Saturday, but there were talks earlier in the window.

What is known is that City do not want the forward to leave and it would need a significant offer for them to consider a sale.

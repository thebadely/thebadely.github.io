According to new developments, A teenage girl has died and a second has been seriously injured in a crash involving a minibus and a car in North Yorkshire, police have said. 

Emergency services were called to Toulston Lane, near Tadcaster Grammar School, at about 12:30 GMT after reports a white Mercedes Sprinter minibus had collided with a Hyundai i10.

The force said the bus had been carrying nine passengers, aged 16 to 18, as well as the driver at the time of the crash.

North Yorkshire Police said the driver of the Hyundai, a 40-year-old woman, had been arrested in connection with the investigation.

The other passengers and the man driving the minibus received treatment at hospital for minor injuries, the force added. 

The minibus had been travelling towards Sherburn when the light-coloured Hyundai entered Toulston Lane from Rudgate, a spokesperson said.

Toulston Lane is closed to traffic while police inquiries continue.

In a message sent to parents, Tadcaster Grammar School said it would be shut on Tuesday as the site "will not be safe for students".

Posting on social media, Sir Alec Sherbrook, MP for Wetherby & Easingwold, called the news "desperately sad".

"The thoughts of prayers of our community are with the families of those affected," he added. 

Speaking from the scene earlier BBC Look North reporter Olivia Richwald said there was a large cordon in place covering three roads close to Tadcaster Grammar School.

She said: "We've seen two vehicles behind that cordon - one a small pale-coloured car with what looks like a dented front bumper.

"The second is larger, perhaps a van or a small bus. It is behind a tarpaulin.

"Police remain guarding the scene tonight."

She added: "The road is quiet and it's not a residential area so there isn't anyone around, except the odd car which is driving up to the road closure signs and turning around." 

Anyone who witnessed the collision or has relevant footage of what happened is asked to contact police.

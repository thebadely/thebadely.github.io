Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Manchester United skipper Bruno Fernandes (centre) with Harry Maguire (right) after the 2-0 win against Sunderland

Bruno Fernandes has no interest in moving to the Saudi Pro League at the end of the season, BBC Sport understands.

The Portugal midfielder rejected huge offers from Al-Hilal and Al-Ittihad last summer in order to stay at Manchester United.

Sources close to the United skipper have completely rejected recent suggestions he is ready to quit Old Trafford after the World Cup next summer and accept a Saudi offer.

BBC Sport has been told that is not the case and Fernandes, whose United contract runs to 2027, with the option of an additional year, is only interested in playing in major European leagues.

As it stands, he is fully committed to United. The project under co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe is a long-term one and sources say Fernandes is determined to put everything into helping United towards a better future, while also believing it is possible to secure a top-five finish that could earn a place in next season's Champions League.

The 31-year-old has been used in a deeper midfield role this season, with manager Ruben Amorim believing Fernandes can be more effective because he gets on the ball more often, although some argue it takes him away from the opposition goal where he is more dangerous.

He remains one of the most influential players in United's squad and in last month's win against Chelsea scored his 100th goal for the club on his 200th Premier League appearance. In total he has played 298 times and Amorim stressed his importance to his squad after the Chelsea game.

"He deserves all the praise," said Amorim.

"That guy deserves to be in the history of our club, not just for what he does but for what his team conquers."

According to new developments, There has been speculation around the Spaniard's future at QPR and he has recently been linked with West Brom 

Queens Park Rangers have put manager Marti Cifuentes on gardening leave just days before their final Championship match of the season.

Assistant coaches Kevin Betsy and Xavi Calm will take charge of the first-team on an interim basis as they prepare for Saturday's away match at Sunderland (12:30 BST).

QPR chief executive Christian Nourry said: "This is naturally a disappointing situation for everyone concerned.

"I fully understand and appreciate supporters' frustrations at this time.

"As a club, we are working to ensure this matter is resolved as swiftly as possible so we can start preparations in earnest for the future."

The decision comes after Saturday's 5-0 loss to Burnley that left QPR 15th in the table.

Asked about his future before the match, he said it was important he and the club were aligned.

And after the match, Cifuentes, 42, said: "I said before that as long as I'm wanted, I'm very happy."

The Spaniard moved to QPR from Swedish club Hammarby to replace Gareth Ainsworth in October 2023 with the team second from bottom in the Championship table.

He steered the club to an 18th-placed finish with three wins at the end of last season.

But he has been linked with a move away from Loftus Road after an inconsistent season, with West Brom the latest club to be mentioned.

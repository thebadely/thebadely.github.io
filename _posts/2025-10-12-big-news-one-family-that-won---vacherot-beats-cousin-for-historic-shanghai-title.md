Here’s what you need to know: Valentin Vacherot had won just one match on the ATP Tour before the Shanghai Masters

World number 204 Valentin Vacherot upset his cousin Arthur Rinderknech to win his first ATP title at the Shanghai Masters.

Monaco's Vacherot fought back from a set down to win 4-6 6-3 6-3 against the world number 54 to become the lowest-ranked ATP Masters 1,000 champion since the series began in 1990.

The 26-year-old earns prize money of Â£824,000 - more than double Vacherot's previous career earnings of Â£380,000.

He sealed the success with a searing forehand down the line and, after hugging Rinderknech at the net, sprinted off court and up to one of the boxes to celebrate with his coach and family.

Vacherot then continued the winner's tradition of writing a message on one of the courtside cameras, writing "Grandpa and Grandma would be proud".

Both players struggled to hold back tears during their post-match speeches on court, while Rinderknech tumbled off the back of the stage as his cousin spoke.

"It is unreal what just happened - I have no idea what is happening right now. I am not even dreaming, it is just crazy," said Vacherot.

"There has to be one loser but I think there are two winners today. One family that won and I think for the sport of tennis, the story is unreal."

Frenchman Rinderknech added: "Valentin, you gave everything. I am so happy for you. Two cousins are stronger than one."

 The story behind Vacherot's emergence from relative obscurity is remarkable: 

It was the first men's tour singles final between family members since John McEnroe beat brother Patrick at the Chicago Open in 1991

Vacherot was not on the original qualifying list so only entered after two players withdrew

He fought back from a set down to win in six of his nine matches

The 26-year-old had won just one match on the main ATP Tour before this tournament, having mainly competed on the lower-level Challenger Tour

He is the first player from Monaco to win a tour-level title in the Open era, which began in 1968

His run to the final included wins over world number 11 Holger Rune and 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic

Victory means Vacherot will break into the ATP top 100 for the first time, while Rinderknech - whose career-high ranking is 42 - will move into the top 40

The pair had played against each other at junior level and in college at Texas A&M University, but never at professional level.

Rinderknech, 30, converted his first break point of the match in the third game as his opponent made a nervy start.

With 20-time Grand Slam champion Roger Federer watching in the stands, Vacherot regained his composure as the rest of the set went with serve.

The second set was similarly close before a superb backhand down the line gave Vacherot a crucial break to go 5-3 up, before holding to set up a decider.

There was a short break between the second and third sets to allow the players to change their shirts, which were drenched in sweat due to the hot and humid conditions.

That stoppage failed to halt Vacherot's momentum as he converted the third of three break points with a stunning cross-court backhand in the first game of the final set.

Rinderknech dug in to stay in the match, saving nine of 10 break points in his first three service games, before needing a medical timeout to have treatment on his back.

He was able to resume but looked to be running on empty as Vacherot closed out the match for a famous victory.

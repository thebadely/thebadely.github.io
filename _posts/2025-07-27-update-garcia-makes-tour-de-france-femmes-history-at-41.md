According to new developments, Mavi Garcia finished 10th overall in the Tour de France Femmes in 2022

Mavi Garcia's aggressive approach paid off as the Spaniard became the oldest stage winner of the Tour de France Femmes.

The Liv-AlUla-Jayco cyclist boldly opted for a solo break with 10km remaining and opened up a gap of around 20 seconds to the chasing peloton.

Garcia held her nerve through the final climb of the 110.4km between Brest and Quimper to seal the first stage victory of her career.

At 41 years, six months and 25 days, Garcia is the oldest competitor on this year's Tour and her feat surpassed Annemiek van Vleuten's record - set in 2022 when she was 39 - as the event's oldest stage winner.

Dutch rider Lorena Wiebes finished second, while Kim Le Court Pienaar of Mauritius took third place and the overall leader's yellow jersey from Marianne Vos.

Monday's third stage takes place between La Gacilly and Angers and covers 163.5km.

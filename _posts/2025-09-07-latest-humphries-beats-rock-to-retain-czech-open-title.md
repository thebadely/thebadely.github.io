According to new developments, Luke Humphries is the reigning Premier League, Players Championship Finals and World Masters champion

World number one Luke Humphries defended his Czech Open title as he beat Josh Rock 8-5 in the final.

Rock, who had beaten Michael van Gerwen en route to the final, got an early break of throw to go 2-0 up but England's Humphries broke back and then reeled off a 12-dart leg to level at 3-3.

The pair then traded legs to reach 5-5 before Humphries won the next three legs on the spin against the Northern Irishman.

Humphries sealed victory with a clinical final leg at the PVA Expo in Prague to retain the title he won a year ago and claim the Â£30,000 top prize.

The 30-year-old's three-dart average of 93.89 was marginally less than Rock's 94.1 but his checkout percentage (34.8% versus 26.3%) was superior.

Humphries has now won the tournament three times in four years following his victories in 2022 and 2024 as he earned the eighth PDC European Tour title of his career.

"If it were up to me, I'd have all 14 European Tours held here. You don't win three times in the same place by accident and it's clearly special to me," Humphries said.

"Since winning the Premier League, the past three months have been tough. I've struggled at times, and I felt like I dragged Josh down at the start of the game. But I never give in - I always try to find a way."

World champion Luke Littler was earlier knocked out in the third round, suffering a surprise 6-4 defeat by Dutchman Gian van Veen.

It has been recently reported that Alex Mann and Josh Macleod will line up together in a Wales back row for the first time this weekend

Summer tour first Test: Japan v Wales

Wales flankers Josh Macleod and Alex Mann have been recalled to face Japan in  Kitakyushu on Saturday.

Interim head coach Matt Sherratt has also brought back half-backs Kieran Hardy and Sam Costelow, Dragons lock Ben Carter and Scarlets centre Johnny Williams.

Sherratt has made 11 changes to the starting side that lost 68-14 to England in March with Dewi Lake, Nicky Smith, Blair Murray and Taulupe Faletau the only survivors.

Cardiff hooker Liam Belcher could make his debut as a replacement if he comes on for Lake, who captains the side. 

Belcher is one of six forwards named on the bench alongside Aaron Wainwright and Tommy Reffell.

"We've had a very good build-up and tried to give everyone a fair chance of selection," said Sherratt.

"One of the key messages was it's going to be a 23-man job. So, we've tried to spread the experience out in terms of getting some experience coming off the bench."

Wales are aiming to end a 17-match international losing streak and record a first Test victory since October 2023.

They will face Eddie Jones' side again in Kobe on Saturday, 12 July.

Macleod and Mann will pack down alongside number eight Taulupe Faletau after the flanker pair were preferred to Wainwright and Reffell, with Taine Plumtree not included in the squad. 

It has been a long road back for Macleod as he prepares to win his third cap, more than two and a half years since his previous international against Australia in November 2022.

The Scarlets skipper has overcome a series of long-term injuries and was included in the squad for Japan following a fine domestic season. 

With Jac Morgan away with the British and Irish Lions, Macleod will wear the Wales number seven shirt. 

"There's a number of players who've worked their way back into the squad and Josh is an obvious one," said Sherratt.

"He's struggled with some injuries, had a real rollercoaster over the last three or four years, so him coming back in is massive."

Cardiff blind-side flanker Mann returns after making his Wales debut during the 2024 Six Nations tournament.

The 23-year-old missed the start of the 2024-25 campaign because of a back injury but impressed when he came back in the latter stages of the season.

Dragons captain Carter is also selected after missing the past two international campaigns because of a knee problem.

Carter packs down in the second row alongside Teddy Williams with James Ratti providing the lock cover from the bench.

Props Nicky Smith and Keiron Assiratti are given starting spots instead of Gareth Thomas and Archie Griffin.

Cardiff coach Sherratt was delighted to name his club captain in the squad.

"I think you could tell from the players' reaction when Liam Belcher was selected how much he deserves it," said Sherratt.

"He's been in the regional game for 10 years. He's changed clubs. 

"He's gone back to university to do an electrician's degree and then he's managed to work his way into the national squad so we are delighted for Liam."

Ospreys scrum-half Hardy is rewarded for his fine form with a first Test start since August 2023.

Hardy, 29, is preferred to his uncapped Ospreys team-mate Reuben Morgan-Williams, with Dragons scrum-half Rhodri Williams providing the replacements cover.

Hardy will partner Scarlets fly-half Costelow who missed the Six Nations because of a fractured collarbone.

Costelow will form a new-look midfield alongside a fresh centre partnership consisting of Ben Thomas and Johnny Williams, who will play his first international since the World Cup win against Portugal in September 2023.

Williams has played the majority of his career at inside centre with his previous seven caps all coming in the number 12 shirt.

The 28-year-old starts for Wales for the first time in the outside centre role as he is preferred to his Scarlets team-mate and number 13 specialist Joe Roberts, who will cover the backline from the bench.

Scarlets full-back Murray will be joined in the back three by wings Tom Rogers and Josh Adams.

Veteran Michael Leitch, 36, will captain Japan and is the only member of the squad who has more than 50 caps.

Leitch has featured in four World Cups and played 87 internationals for the Brave Blossoms.

Head coach Jones says Japan were without about 15 players as he named eight uncapped internationals in his match-day 23.

Prop Yota Kamimori and wing Kippei Ishida, who Jones says can be a Japan version of South Africa double World Cup winner Cheslin Kolbe, will both make international debuts, while there are six new potential caps on the replacements bench.

Toulouse scrum-half Naoto Saito, who was part of the squad that won the French Top 14 title last weekend, is not involved this Saturday but will be available for the second Test in Kobe.  

Japan's only victory in 14 games against Wales came in 2013 when the 23-8 victory was masterminded by Jones during his first spell in charge.

Japan are 13th in the World Rugby rankings, one place below Wales.

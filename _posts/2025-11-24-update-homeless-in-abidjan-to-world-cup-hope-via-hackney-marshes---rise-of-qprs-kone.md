Here’s what you need to know: Richard Kone has experienced a unique journey to become a star

Fewer than two years ago, Richard Kone was playing in the ninth tier of English football. Now he is an Ivory Coast international.

The Queens Park Rangers striker's rise to the top is made all the more remarkable by the fact he was homeless at the age of 16.

In 2019, Kone was just trying to survive on the streets of Abidjan.

If selected for the national team again in the summer, he will be playing at the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

From homelessness to his first international cap via step five of non-league football, winning League One player of the year and moving to the Championship, the 22-year-old's journey so far has been incredible.

Richard Kone's rise to the top started when he played at the Homeless World Cup in Cardiff in 2019, aged just 16

"It is terribly difficult being homeless in my country," Kone said of sleeping rough in Abidjan, a city on the south coast of Ivory Coast.

"Some people won't talk with you when you try to ask for a little bit of help or a little bit of money."

But one friend did eventually help Kone by recognising his potential and introducing him to the president of Ivory Coast's street soccer initiative called Don't Forget Them Association.

After working hard and training every day, it ultimately led to Kone's selection to represent his country at the Homeless World Cup in Cardiff in 2019.

The tournament in the UK was the first time he had left the country, let alone flown on a plane.

It would prove to be the watershed moment in Kone's football career.

Richard Kone was spotted playing football on his own before being asked to sign for non-league club Athletic Newham

Following the Homeless World Cup, a 16-year-old Kone moved to Hackney in east London.

And it was there that a purely chance encounter would lead him to sign for non-league side Athletic Newham in the Eastern Counties League Division One South - the 10th tier of the English football pyramid.

"Richard Kone's story with Athletic Newham began in the most unexpected of placesâ¦ Hackney Marshes," Athletic Newham chairman Kennedy Tavares told BBC Sport.

"He was there playing football on his own when I noticed him. Something about Richard stood out immediately.

"I invited him to come and train with the team and from that moment we never looked back. What followed was an incredible spell at the club."

Kone instantly hit the ground running with a hat-trick on his debut against Fire United in September 2019.

"It was the perfect introduction to a player who would go on to define an era for us," said Tavares.

Kone went on to score 25 goals in 40 games across all competitions in his first two seasons, helping Athletic Newham win promotion to the Essex Senior League in 2021.

His goalscoring prowess continued to improve, netting 82 times in 90 games across the following two seasons.

By the end of the 2022-23 campaign, professional clubs couldn't help but stand up and take notice of Kone's prolific finishing ability.

That summer, League One club Wycombe Wanderers took Kone on an extended trial.

He bagged a further 18 goals in 18 games for Athletic Newham in the months that followed and in January 2024, Kone signed for the Chairboys aged 20.

The rest, as they say, is history.

And Kone quite literally made history in his first full season at Wycombe as he scored the club's fastest-ever EFL hat-trick within nine minutes in a 3-1 win over Peterborough in October 2024.

Kone ended last season with 21 goals in all competitions, including 18 league goals and three assists, as Wycombe reached the play-off semi-finals.

Kone scooped both League One player and young player of the year awards for 2024-25

His exploits saw him win both League One player and young player of the season for 2024-25 at the EFL Awards, as well as being named in the team of the season.

He was also later named the PFA League One player of the year in August.

"It's an unbelievable achievement," Kone told BBC Sport after the EFL Awards in April this year.

"I wouldn't have thought of this two years ago and to be standing here winning not one but two awards and to be in the team of the season is just amazing.

"I'm really proud of myself. I am just enjoying the moment."

Richard Kone is the fifth leading goalscorer across the EFL since the start of the 2024-25 season with 22

Kone's rise to become one of the most sought-after strikers in the EFL was described as "nothing short of remarkable" by BBC Three Counties Radio commentator Sam Avery.

"For someone who was brought in as an unknown quantity and from the ninth tier, Kone quickly established himself as an important player and very impressive goalscorer," Avery said.

"He was extremely humble during his time at Wycombe, even when the spotlight was on him, taking everything in his stride and showing maturity beyond his years."

It seems Kone's character is something that has never wavered throughout his career so far, regardless of where he is playing his football.

"Richard was the type of player who simply loved the game," said Tavares.

"Always eager to learn, always open to advice - not just from coaches, but from anyone around the club. His attitude, hunger and humility made him a joy to work with."

Several Championship clubs were linked with Kone following an excellent 18 months at Wycombe and in August, it was QPR who secured his signature.

As has been the case throughout Kone's rollercoaster journey over the past two years, another milestone - and perhaps the biggest of them all - was just around the corner.

His first Ivory Coast senior call-up and debut.

Three months on from joining the Hoops, Kone got the call every player dreams of and made his first international appearance as a 62nd-minute substitute in a 2-0 friendly win against Oman in Al-Seeb on 18 November.

"That's what I'm playing football for, to represent my country at international level," Kone told the Rising Ballers YouTube channel, external after signing for QPR.

"Afcon, maybe the World Cupâ¦ that's why I am always fighting, trying to be the best so I can get a call-up."

Tavares said everyone at Athletic Newham "always knew Kone had something special".

"His progress is no surprise to those who saw him every day and eventually he has earned the opportunity he deserved," he added.

"A remarkable journey and one we are proud to have been part of."

Kone has scored four goals in 15 Championship games so far for QPR

Kone still hasn't forgotten where it all started for him at the Homeless World Cup six years ago and said playing at the event was "life-changing".

"It gave me the platform to grow and set me on the career path to where I am today," he said.

Homeless World Cup organisers said they have "watched with enormous pride" as Kone has risen from non-league to become an international.

"Richard's story shows the true potential of every single player who comes through our tournament, that with opportunity, support and belief, extraordinary things can happen," said spokesperson Matthew Williams.

"Richard embodies the spirit of the Homeless World Cup and his success is a testament to the life-changing impact football can have."

While at the tournament in 2019, Kone had said would like to go back to school and "maybe become a lawyer or doctor".

Now the biggest stage in world football could await him in seven months' time.

Let's dive into the details: Manchester City have lost just one of their last 49 home Premier League games when ahead at the break (W42 D6)

Kevin de Bruyne scored the only goal on his penultimate game at Etihad Stadium as Manchester City beat Wolves and moved up to third in the Premier League.

Pep Guardiola's side extended their unbeaten run to nine games while moving four points clear of sixth-placed Nottingham Forest as the race to qualify for next season's Champions League continues.

Manchester City have won four consecutive Premier League matches for the first time since their 13-match winning run between April and September 2024.

They travel to relegated Southampton next weekend before hosting Bournemouth, completing the campaign with a trip to Fulham. 

On Thursday night, a 2-0 defeat at home against Brentford, who hold their own European ambitions, left Forest sitting sixth and up against it in their bid to secure a first appearance in Europe's premier competition since 1980.

It is the first time Forest have lost successive home fixtures in the Premier League this season.

They must now rely on sides above them to drop points while also finding a way to address their own form, having lost three of their past four league outings.

There are still just five points separating Aston Villa in seventh with fourth-placed Newcastle.

With the Premier League's top five guaranteed a spot in the Champions League next term, the race for Europe remains closely contested as the season enters its final weeks. 

As many as 11 European places are up for grabs and there will definitely be a minimum of eight Premier League teams - up from the usual seven - playing in Europe next season, but things could change in the coming weeks.

It means Crystal Palace, down in 12th, remain in contention for a place in Europe through the league as well as if they win the FA Cup. 

BBC Sport takes a look at how many teams could qualify for each of the European competitions - the Champions League, Europa League and Conference League.

Depending on how things pan out this season there will be between eight and 11 teams from the Premier League taking part in Europe next season.

A minimum of five of those will be in the Champions League, which is higher than the usual four because of England's performance in Uefa's coefficient rankings.

That number could rise to six should Arsenal win the Champions League and finish outside the top five - an unlikely prospect - or even seven if that happens and Manchester United or Tottenham win the Europa League.

The chances of Manchester United or Tottenham lifting the Europa League were strengthened on Thursday as both clubs stole a march on their rivals in the first leg of their semi-final tie.

United won 3-0 at Athletic Bilbao with Tottenham beating Bodo/Glimt 3-1 at home.

The maximum number of Premier League teams who could be competing in the Europa League is three. 

Two places will likely go to the team who finishes sixth and the FA Cup winners.

However, if the cup winners have already secured a European place it will then go to the next highest placed side that has not qualified for Europe.

A third place could be awarded if Chelsea win the Conference League and fail to qualify for the Champions League.

Chelsea's hopes of winning the Conference League were boosted on Thursday courtesy of a 4-1 win at Djurgarden in the first-leg of their semi-final.

There will be one Conference League place awarded to a Premier League team.

Currently, that will go to Carabao Cup winners Newcastle, but that could change if Eddie Howe's side qualify for the Champions League or the Europa League. 

As Newcastle currently sit inside the top four that looks likely.

There is a realistic scenario where finishing ninth or 10th in the Premier League could earn you a spot in the Conference League.

This could happen, but it is highly improbable.

It would require Arsenal to win the Champions League, Manchester United or Tottenham to win the Europa League and Chelsea to lift the Conference League trophy, and all three winners to finish outside the top six.

Arsenal are second in the Premier League and highly unlikely to finish outside the top five.

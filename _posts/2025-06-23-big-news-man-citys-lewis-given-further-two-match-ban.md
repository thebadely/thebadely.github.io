Experts revealed that Rico Lewis (right) was a shown a straight red card for catching Samuel Obeng in the face with his boot as both players slid for a loose ball

Manchester City defender Rico Lewis has been given a further two-match ban for his red card in their Club World Cup opener against Wydad Casablanca.

The 20-year-old England full-back was dismissed in the 88th minute of City's 2-0 win over the Moroccan side in Philadelphia on Wednesday.

He was given an automatic one-match ban and missed Monday's 6-0 win against United Arab Emirates side Al Ain in Atlanta, but that ban has now been extended as a Fifa disciplinary committee ruled the tackle was "serious foul play".

City appealed against the extension but were unsuccessful, meaning the academy graduate will miss Thursday's game against Juventus and their last-16 tie.

Pep Guardiola's side are already guaranteed a place in the knockout stage after winning both their group matches so far.

Here’s what you need to know: It is the third time in four years the men's European Champion has been British

British skeleton racer Matt Weston won his second European title as compatriot Tabby Stoecker claimed a silver medal in St Moritz.

Weston came away with a combined two-run time of two minutes 16.58 seconds to beat Italy's Amedeo Bagnis by 0.91secs.

It followed Weston's victory over Bagnis at the same track at the World Championships in 2023, and followed his World Cup win there on Wednesday.

The result makes Weston a multiple European champion, joining Kristan Bromley (2004, 2005, 2008 and 2009) and Shelley Rudman (2009 and 2011) as the only Britons to win the title more than once.

It is the third time in four years the men's European title has been won by a British athlete, after Marcus Wyatt claimed gold in 2024 following Weston's first triumph.

Earlier on Friday, Stoecker secured European Championship silver in the women's race becoming the sixth British woman to win a continental medal since the event began in 2003.

Stoecker now sits fourth in the overall World Cup standings going into next Friday's final race

The 25-year-old former trapeze artist recorded a two-run time of 2:22.23 in the penultimate top-tier race before next month's Olympic Winter Games.

Stoecker's result continues Britain's strong recent success in the women's European Championships, with British athletes now winning medals at every event during the current Olympic cycle. 

Amelia Coltman won silver last season in Lillehammer and bronze the year before in Sigulda.

Friday's racing also doubled as a World Cup event and Stoecker's second place finish lifts her to fourth in the overall World Cup standings before next Friday's season finale in Altenberg, Germany.

Weston's success, meanwhile, means he has now won five of the six World Cup races so far this season.

The medals come as a timely boost for the pair with the Winter Olympics in Italy getting under way on 6 February.

Scotland's difficult preparation for the Women's Rugby World Cup continued with a warm-up defeat by Italy in Parma.

Earlier this week, captain Rachel Malcolm said her side had been put in an "unfair position" by a "very disruptive" build-up to the tournament.

More than half the squad face uncertainty over their contracts, while head coach Bryan Easson will step down after the World Cup - a decision Malcom described as "a shock" and "upsetting".

Scotland, perhaps unsurprisingly, started slowly in northern Italy and went into half-time 15 points behind as Alyssa D'Inca crossed twice for hosts, in addition to tries from Vittoria Vecchini and Aura Muzzo.

Bristol Bears' Lana Skeldon scored Scotland's only points of the opening period off the back of a powerful rolling maul.

Easson's side improved after the break and got themselves within three points thanks to Helen Nelson's try in the corner and Evie Gallagher's converted score.

However, Italian replacement Beatrice Rigoni broke Scotland's defensive line to keep the visitors at arm's length, before some quick hands released D'Inca to complete her hat-trick.

Gallagher crashed over for her second try, but the visitors were unable to cross again in the limited time that remained.

The Scots face Ireland in another warm-up in Cork on 2 August, before their World Cup opener against Wales on 23 August.

Italy: Granzotto, Muzzo, Sillari, Mannini, D'Inca, Stevanin, Stefan; Maris, Vecchini, Seye, Fedrighi, Duca, Sgorbini, Veronese, Giordano.

Scotland: Scott, Lloyd, Wills, Thomson, Grant, Nelson, Brebner-Holden; Bartlett, Skeldon, Clarke, Wassell, Ferrie, Malcolm, McLachlan, Gallagher.

Replacements: Martin, Wright, Cockburn, Donaldson, Stewart, Mattinson, Ramsay, Rollie.

Referee: Aurelie Groizeleau.

According to new developments, Rob Hunter is the second coach to leave Exeter this season following defence coach Omar Mouneimne

Exeter head coach Rob Hunter has left the club by mutual consent.

The move comes four days after he and attack coach Ali Hepher were suspended following Chiefs' club-record 79-17 loss at Gloucester.

Hunter had only had four games as head coach, having been promoted to the role following Hepher's demotion in March.

After a 52-38 loss at Bristol, he led Exeter to their third win of the season with a 17-15 victory over Newcastle.

An encouraging 26-24 loss to Bath followed before last Sunday's 13-try thrashing at Kingsholm.

It brings to an end a 13-year spell at Sandy Park for the former England Under-20s boss.

He spent much of his time as Exeter's forwards coach and helped the club win two Premiership titles and the 2020 European Champions Cup. 

Exeter chairman and chief executive Tony Rowe said: "On behalf of everyone at Exeter Rugby Club, I would like to express our gratitude to Rob for his dedication and the impact he has had during his time with us. We wish him every success in his future endeavours." 

Director of rugby Rob Baxter, who has returned to overseeing coaching for the rest of the season, added: "Rob has been an integral part of our coaching team across multiple seasons. 

"I want to personally thank him for his hard work, loyalty, and the positive influence he has had on the squad.

"Although it is never easy to part ways with someone who has contributed so much, we look forward with confidence and enthusiasm as we continue to build on the strong foundations Rob has helped to establish."

Hunter is the second coach this season to leave the troubled club, who are ninth in the Premiership this season.

Defence coach Omar Mouneimne left at the end of October as Exeter had their worst start to a season in their history - a run of eight successive league losses.

But the poor form continued as they were heavily beaten in all of their Champions Cup pool games - including a record European defeat - 69-17 - by Bordeaux.

Baxter is now in control of coaching until the end of the season, with new defence coach Haydn Thomas and skills coach Ricky Pellow alongside him.

But it means he will be looking for at least two new coaches in the summer, with former Newcastle boss Dave Walder heavily linked with becoming the club's new backs coach.

The club will also need a head coach, and may well want to add a forwards specialist as well. 

Hepher is due to leave his first-team role at the end of the season for a new position working with academy players transitioning to the Exeter first team. 

Exeter's next game is at home to reigning Premiership champions Northampton on Sunday, 11 May - when they will be without influential number eight Greg Fisilau and Wales centre Joe Hawkins after they were injured in the Gloucester loss.

Let's dive into the details: Celtic fans have been protesting against the club's board at the start of this season

Celtic fans will continue to demonstrate their dissatisfaction with the club's board with a late entry protest at Kilmarnock on Sunday.

A substantial section of supporters remain angry about a lack of significant summer signings and failure to reach the Champions League has heightened pressure on those in charge at Celtic Park.

A lengthy club statement explaining recent recruitment was met with widespread derision and prompted an open letter from fans groups demanding answers for "repeated failures in transfer dealings".

Those groups have since released a joint communication saying their concerns have "still to be addressed" despite the open letter "representing tens of thousands of Celtic fans".

They cite a survey with 38,832 respondents and say there is an "overwhelming consensus" to back the following strategy.

"To build on the recent 'no confidence' votes on the Celtic FC board, seeking the removal of Michael Nicholson, CEO, Chris McKay, CFO, Peter Lawwell, chairman.

"To build a strategic, escalatory campaign against the Celtic board.

"To build a democratic and representative fan body

"To coordinate a 'late entry' protest at Kilmarnock v Celtic to further visualise and vocalise fan discontent.

"To help progress these points and the fan movement generally, a steering group of volunteers is being assembled."

With 10 points from four matches, Celtic sit top of the Scottish Premiership as they aim for a 14th title in 15 seasons.

The joint statement ends: "It is natural that there will be a mix of feeling regarding some actions or inaction, however the most important consideration at this stage is maintaining, building and utilising broad fan support."

It has been recently reported that Nick Kyrgios has won seven ATP singles titles

Australian Nick Kyrgios says he will miss this year's Wimbledon after suffering a "small setback" on his latest return from injury.

Kyrgios, who was beaten in the 2022 final at the All England Club by Novak Djokovic, has played very little tennis over the past two years because of a troublesome wrist that required surgery.

In March at the Miami Open, the 30-year-old won his first singles match since 2022 but later pulled out of the French Open with a knee injury, where he had been scheduled to play men's doubles.

The Australian wrote on Instagram: "I've hit a small setback in my recovery and unfortunately I won't make it back for grass season this year. 

"I know how much you've been looking forward to seeing me out there and I'm genuinely sorry to disappoint. This is just a bump in the road though and I'm already working hard to get back stronger than ever."

Wimbledon gets under way on 30 June.

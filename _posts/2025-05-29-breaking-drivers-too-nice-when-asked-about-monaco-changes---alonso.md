Spanish Grand Prix: Five things to know before race weekend

Fernando Alonso says Formula 1 drivers are "too nice" in politely fielding questions about whether the Monaco Grand Prix needs changing.

Several drivers have criticised the rule change that was introduced for the event last weekend that required drivers to make two pit stops at Monaco.

The Aston Martin driver, a two-time world champion and double winner in Monaco, said: "There is this constant talk of how bad is something, instead of how good is something.

"This is Monaco. Maybe there is a couple of ideas between all involved in the sport we can think of for Monaco, but I don't think there is any need to think of anything.

"It is only because there is a lot of content now to be created and drivers we are too nice so we answer every question.

"If 40 years ago you ask [Ayrton] Senna and [Alain] Prost about Monaco after one week and they are fighting for the championship, they will be less polite than we are."

Alonso, the most experienced driver in F1 history, said that in Monaco "you see one overtake every 10 years".

He added: "I am always a little bit surprised about the negative comments from Monaco on Monday.

"Don't worry next year we will go to Monaco and on Wednesday we will be so excited, and on Friday we all say it's the best track of the season and we all want to win Monaco, and then on Saturday we are all super-excited and the adrenalin on those laps is unique. And then on Sunday we will be disappointed once again. It is what it is."

Grand Prix Drivers' Association (GDPA) chairman Alex Wurz posted on Instagram this week some changes to the track, external he believed could make racing better there, including moving the harbour front chicane and reprofiling the Loews and Rascasse corners a little.

Mercedes driver George Russell, a director of the GPDA, said the changes "would definitely not make it worse", but added: "Monaco has always been the same. I don't have the answer. Part of me thinks we should just accept Monaco for what it is.

"F1 is better for having Monaco on the calendar. Qualifying is exciting, the race is boring but it makes us appreciate some of the other races."

Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, who won in Monaco in 2024 and was second this season, said: "Do we need to make absolutely every possible effort to make it better on the Sunday? Definitely. 

"But Monaco has always been like that. Monaco has always been the kind of race where the Sunday not much is happening or a lot less compared to other races. 

"The qualifying in Monaco is unbelievable, and that's what makes Monaco so special."

How to follow Spanish Grand Prix on the BBC

Fernando Alonso (black and white race suit) made his F1 debut for Minardi at the Australian Grand Prix in 2001 

Alonso is under contract to Aston Martin until the end of next season, by which time he will be 45.

He said in an interview with BBC Sport at the end of last season of 2026 that "probably - or at least to start - it will be my last season in F1".

But on media day before the Spanish Grand Prix, he said he was still feeling competitive and motivated.

"I need to see how next year starts and how motivated I am," Alonso said.

"Every year there is a different mood into the season, a different feeling on how you perform, how competitive you feel, how motivated you are to keep your  fitness at the high level, personal situation, all these things play a role in some important decisions in life.

"I know a very important decision will come in the near future [about] when I stop racing.

"I first drove a go-kart when I was three years old. I am now 43. I have been a steering wheel in my hands for 40 years, I know one year I will have to stop and it's an important decision I will think carefully. I stopped F1 in 2018 and I came back because I needed. The next one that I take it has to be 100% sure."

Alonso has yet to score a point this season, and is on his equal worst start to a season ever.

Apart from a crash in the wet in Australia, when he was the first to come across a large amount of gravel thrown on to the track by Pierre Gasly's Alpine in front of him, this is largely because his car has failed in the few races in which the Aston Martin has been competitive enough to race in the top 10.

For example, his engine failed when he was running sixth in Monaco last weekend.

In qualifying, he is nine-one ahead of team-mate Lance Stroll at an average advantage of 0.297secs.

Alonso added: "You need to feel it when it's time [to retire]. And I don't feel it yet.

"I jump in the car tomorrow and Sunday and I am so happy to be there and motivated and performing well.

"If we keep healthy and in good conditions, the stopwatch will tell me I don't feel fast enough but so far I am happy with that.

"Even if the results are not nice at the moment, I am so motivated to go to the next race and try to overcome and the and race have a better race. All these things are very alive now but there is no guarantee that will be forever."

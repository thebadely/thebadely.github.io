Hereâ€™s what you need to know: A man accused of crashing his car through the gates of actor Jennifer Aniston's home has been charged with stalking and vandalism. 

Jimmy Wayne Carwyle, of New Albany, Mississippi, is accused of repeatedly sending the Friends star unwanted voicemail, email and social media messages since March 2023.

The 48-year-old is alleged to have crashed his grey Chrysler PT Cruiser through the front gate of Aniston's home in the Bel Air neighbourhood of Los Angeles on Monday afternoon.

Prosecutors said the collision caused major damage and Aniston, 56, was at home at the time of the incident. 

According to the LA Police Department, a security guard stopped Carwyle on Aniston's driveway before police arrived and arrested him.

Carwyle has been charged with felony stalking and vandalism, prosecutors said on Thursday.

He also faces an aggravating circumstance of the threat of great bodily harm.

Carwyle is accused of harassing the Friends actor since 1 March 2023 by sending her unwanted communications. 

He is due to appear in court on Thursday. 

If convicted of the charges, he could face up to three years in prison, according to the LA Police Department. 

District Attorney Nathan Hochman said: "Stalking is a crime that can quickly escalate from harassment to dangerous, violent actions. 

"My office is committed to aggressively prosecuting those who stalk and terrorise others." 

Aniston has not yet commented on the incident and there have been no reports of injuries.

This is not the first time Aniston has encountered stalking, having previously obtained a restraining order against a man who believed he was in a relationship with her in 2010.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Gael Bigirimana scored at Wembley to help Coventry win the Checkatrade Trophy in 2017

He's played at Old Trafford and the Emirates, scored at Wembley and featured in one of football's biggest tournaments.

Yet it's a small town in Northern Ireland, playing in front of 2,000 people most weeks, where Gael Bigirimana feels most at home. 

From Newcastle United to Dungannon Swifts, it's been some journey for the Burundi international. 

The 31-year-has been a revelation since moving to Stangmore Park in 2023, and he has helped the Irish Premiership's underdogs to a second-ever Irish Cup final and a possible European adventure.

Bigirimana is loved in Dungannon, and that feeling is mutual.

In his words, sometimes "simplicity is genius".

"I've been on the other end of where I am now, when I was at such a big club and earning money that, as a kid, I never would have dreamed of," said Bigirimana, who played for Burundi at the Africa Cup of Nations in 2019.

"I know the benefit of all the finance and glamour of playing at a high-level team, but you can lose the simplicity and love of the game. 

"That's what it's all about, people helping each other and building a community where others can have inspiration."

Gael Bigirimana made 25 appearances for Newcastle United

Bigirmana says he has always been football mad and says the "simplicity" and "challenge" of playing at Dungannon were part of the appeal.

"I have fun doing it, the ups and downs that come with it. 

"Could I come here and make an impact and serve this club? And serve my team-mates to enable them to get the best out of themselves and do well? 

"That was my ambition to come here, and I'm thankful to God that the fruits are showing."

It's a world away from the riches of the Premier League, where Bigirimana played for Newcastle United and made 25 appearances for the club in 2013.

After moving on to St James' Park, he had a successful spell with Coventry, and went on to feature with Motherwell, Glentoran and Young Africans in Tanzania. 

But now, Bigirimana, along with his wife and two children, has embedded himself in the community in Dungannon, which is located in the heart of County Tyrone. 

"It's been a blessed time for me, my wife and my two kids," he added. 

"We've enjoyed the town and people are really, really friendly. 

"As a human, you can only ask for such a strong community and they would go an extra mile to make sure you are well looked after."

After previously playing in the Irish Premiership for Glentoran, Gael Bigirimana joined Dungannon Swifts in 2023

Despite a career that spans 11 years, more than 250 appearances in four countries, Bigirimana has just one medal from his career as a professional.

That came in the Checkatrade Trophy final in 2017, when he scored the opening goal at Wembley as Coventry City defeated Oxford United 2-1.

While he says the time at Newcastle United was "a fantastic experience that will stick with me for the rest of my life", that final with Coventry was the "highlight" of his career.

But that could be about to change. 

Dungannon Swifts have never won the Irish Cup - the most prestigious knockout trophy in Northern Irish football.

"I think it would be the best highlight of my career, 100%," Bigirimana said when asked where winning the Irish Cup would rank.

"The game against Cliftonville will be a difficult game because they are such a strong club.

"They have some very good players and we know the obstacles that are in front of us. 

"For the club, the town, having a small budget and us being part-time, for us to lift that trophy would make me a very happy man.

"It's going to be such a huge day for Dungannon Swifts and for the town. 

"We are really looking forward to it."

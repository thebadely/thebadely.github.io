According to new developments, Lando Norris has only failed to finish on the podium in one race so far this season

Canadian Grand Prix

Venue: Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, Montreal Dates: 13-15 June Race start: 19:00 BST on Sunday

Coverage: Live commentary of third practice and qualifying on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra 2 with race on BBC Radio 5 Live; live text updates on BBC Sport website and app

Lando Norris said McLaren had their "worst Friday of the year so far" after finishing second fastest behind Mercedes' George Russell in practice at the Canadian Grand Prix.

Russell was 0.028 seconds faster than Norris, with the second Mercedes of Kimi Antonelli 0.288secs slower than his team-mate in third place.

Norris' team-mate Oscar Piastri, who leads the Briton by 10 points in the drivers' championship, was sixth.

Norris said: "A tricky day, probably one of the trickiest we have had this year. A little bit off the pace compared to the others and it maybe didn't look it at the end but difficult to put a lap together and be consistent.

"I did one good lap at the end of the session. We have some work to do."

He added: "We need to get the car in a better place. The track is difficult but it has definitely been our worst Friday of the year so far.

"Not in terms of pace but in terms of being able to to put it together and most tricky. We're not miles away, just need to make it a little bit easier to drive.

"We're still in a good position, it's close. Mercedes seem very, very quick, just as they were last year. They were quite easily the best last year."

Norris was trying a new front suspension design that the team hope will improve the lack of feeling from the front axle that has affected his ability to trust the car on the absolute limit in qualifying this season.

The upgrade was available to both drivers but only Norris used it on Friday. Piastri has been more comfortable with the feel of the front of the car, partly explaining the turnaround in form between them since last year.

Norris said the car felt "pretty similar" in its new specification, adding: "Honestly, it's hard to say from one track, you have to go to many more. Especially here, it is unique with the bumps and kerbs and low grip we have. A bit too early to tell but all are aimed to move the car in the right direction and give me more feeling, which is a good thing."

Russell said: "It might be my first time top of the leaderboard all year. Very positive day.

"We had higher expectations coming to this weekend because cooler conditions, the track's quite smooth so the tyres naturally run quite cold and we know our weakness.

"When it's hot, we struggle and when it's cold, the tyres run cold, we're pretty competitive. The was definitely validation today.

"The lap was really strong today, probably optimised, nothing more in the tank, we had it all on the table full beans, power and everything."

Russell set his fastest time on the medium tyre, while Norris used the soft.

This reflects a potential repeat of the phenomenon experienced at last month's Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, when some teams felt the medium compound was a better qualifying tyre than the soft.

The tyre selection is the same as at Imola, with Pirelli's softest compound, the C6, as the soft. This is a fragile tyre that can be hard to make work over one lap.

Russell said: "A number of teams are thinking about the medium tyre. Come qualifying, do you go on the soft or the medium? That's one of the challenges when we have the C6 compound."

Williams' Alex Albon and Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso were fourth and fifth, ahead of Piastri, Williams' Carlos Sainz, Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton and Red Bull's Max Verstappen.

Belying his one-lap pace, the Dutchman, the closest challenger to the leading McLaren drivers in the championship, was the fastest on the race-simulation runs late in the session, although closely matched with Russell, Norris and Piastri.

Verstappen said: "Day was all right. I felt quite happy with the car. P2 was a bit more difficult. We lost something with the car, balance-wise and ride, which we need to investigate, but overall it was quite a positive day for us."

Hamilton's team-mate Charles Leclerc missed the second session after a crash midway through the first.

Leclerc's impact with the barriers after locking his brakes at Turn Three and misjudging whether he could make the corner damaged his car's chassis and it needed to be replaced before Saturday's running.

Aston Martin's Lance Stroll crashed early in the second session, hitting the barrier a glancing blow on the exit of Turn Six and breaking his left front suspension.

His car suffered understeer on the exit of the corner and the front washed out into the wall. Stroll had experienced the situation earlier in the lap but it was exacerbated in the incident by 'dirty air' from the traffic ahead.

A number of other drivers misjudged their braking points and skipped over the grass at one of the chicanes with no damage.

And Alpine's Franco Colapinto had his second spin of the day at Turn Two, after an earlier one in the first session. The Argentine ended the second session slowest of the drivers who set a time.

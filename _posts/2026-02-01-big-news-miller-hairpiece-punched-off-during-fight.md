Experts revealed that Miller has only lost once in his professional career

"Miller wins it by a hair."

That line of commentary had a meaning beyond Jarrell Miller's split-decision win over Kingsley Ibeh at Madison Square Garden on Saturday.

In an unusual moment on the undercard of the title fight between Shakur Stevenson and Teofimo Lopez, American Miller threw his toupee into the crowd after it was dislodged late in the second round.

The 37-year-old absorbed a flurry of punches that resulted in his head snapping back, causing his hairpiece to lift.

Miller revealed he had lost his natural hair close to the fight because of a poor shampoo choice.

"I get to my mama's house and I saw some shampoo bottles on the table," Miller said in a post-fight interview in the ring.

"I shampooed and it was like ammonium bleach. I literally lost my hair like two days ago.

"So I called my manager and said, 'Get me one of those manes,' and I slapped that on real quick.

"It's funny, man. I'm a comedian and you've got to make fun of yourself."

Once the toupee was removed, Miller gave it to the crowd and began celebrating like he had won the bout, before quickly reverting to fight mode.

"I've seen a lot in boxing but I've never seen that," DAZN commentator Chris Mannix added.

Boxer Fabio Wardley posted "don't worry I'll keep it safe" with a video of the toupee on the seat beside him, while Skye Nicolson, external also posed with it on her head.

Miller said he "messed up" in 2019 when he had his fight cancelled with Anthony Joshua because of a failed drugs test.

He returned in 2022 and suffered his first career loss a year later to Daniel Dubois, before drawing with Andy Ruiz, who replaced him for the Joshua fight, last year.

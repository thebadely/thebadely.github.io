It has been recently reported that Lucas Bergvall has won six caps for Sweden

Tottenham Hotspur are waiting on a final diagnosis on Lucas Bergvall's ankle injury amid early concerns he faces up to three months on the sidelines.

The Sweden international suffered the issue in the 2-0 Champions League win over Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday night and was substituted in the second half after trying to continue playing.

Bergvall, 19, is now set to be unavailable for a significant period of time, news that will arrive as a blow to head coach Thomas Frank.

Spurs medics are still assessing the injury with the club still to communicate how severe Bergvall's injury is.

Frank did not give a timescale in his news conference before Saturday's Premier League match at Burnley.

An injury lay-off of three months is said to be the worst case scenario for Bergvall following initial tests.

Bergvall joined Tottenham in February 2024 and has made 26 appearances for the north London side this season

Spurs sit 14th in the Premier League after a disappointing first half of the season under Frank.

The Dane has been contending with a long list of injuries, with James Maddison, Rodrigo Bentancur, Mohammed Kudus, Dejan Kulusevski and Ben Davies out long-term.

Richarlison is set to return from a thigh injury in six weeks, while Palhinha is also sidelined with a knock.

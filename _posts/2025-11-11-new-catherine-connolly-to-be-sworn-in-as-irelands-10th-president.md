According to new developments, The inauguration of the Republic of Ireland's 10th president will take place later on Tuesday.

Independent politician Catherine Connolly was elected in a landslide vote at the end of October - defeating Fine Gael candidate Heather Humphreys.

The 68 year old will take over the role from Michael D Higgins, whose 14-year term ended at midnight.

The inauguration ceremony for the president-elect - set to be attended by politicians, judges and other invited guests - will take place at Dublin Castle.

The Republic's president is the country's head of state, however it is a non-executive role.

On Tuesday morning, the president-elect will travel from Farmleigh at Phoenix Park to Dublin Castle with her husband, Brian McEnery, in a ceremonial motorcade.

There she will be sworn into office in St Patrick's Hall by the chief justice.

During the ceremony, a service of prayer and reflection will take place.

Connolly will make a speech after being presented with the Presidential Seal.

As well as the taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Micheál Martin, tánaiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Simon Harris, senior Irish government ministers and judges will attend the inauguration.

Northern Ireland's First Minister Michelle O'Neill will also attend the ceremony and will be accompanied by Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald.

Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly will not be attending the inauguration.

Little-Pengelly said she has a number of commitments in Belfast and Windsor for Remembrance Day on Tuesday.

She wished the new president well and said she was hoping to have a phone call with her.

In the absence of Little-Pengelly, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is not sending a representative to attend the inauguration, with party leader Gavin Robinson insisting it is not a "snub".

He said the party would be "pleased" to meet Connolly when she visits Northern Ireland in the future in her formal capacity.

Ulster Unionist Party assembly member (MLA) Steve Aiken will be the only unionist politician attending the inauguration.

He confirmed he would be attending in place of party leader Mike Nesbitt who has other commitments.

After the ceremony, the newly inaugurated president will then travel to Áras an Uachtaráin, the official home of the Irish president, via motorcade.

A state reception will take place on Tuesday evening in Dublin Castle.

Connolly has served as a TD (member of Irish parliament) since 2016 and her election as president will trigger a by-election in Galway West.

She previously worked as a barrister and psychologist.

Experts revealed that Arbeloa played for Liverpool (2007-2009) and West Ham (2016-2017) during his career

Real Madrid's decision to appoint Alvaro Arbeloa as head coach has been met largely with scepticism. Many supporters see the move as an unnecessary, premature risk rather than a bold, strategic appointment.

On the surface, the choice appears puzzling. Arbeloa lacks the glittering senior managerial CV you may expect a Real Madrid head coach to have.

But behind the initial reaction, the move reflects Real Madrid's prioritisation of identity and continuity, with those inside the club viewing it not as a gamble but as a calculated decision based on the loyalty of someone who has been part of Real for many years.

It is a philosophy that was made clear by Arbeloa himself at his unveiling.

"On Saturday I turn 43 and 20 of those years have been at this club. Every day I'm at the best club in the world," he said.

"This club is about winning, winning, and winning again. When I was a player, I learned those values from the people in that dressing room. They're still there, and that's what matters."

Here we explore what Arbeloa might bring to the role, judging by his time behind the scenes coaching youth and reserve teams at Madrid and what he said at his first news conference. And we look at why there is still uncertainty over the club's long-term direction, despite the appointment.

Alonso leaves role as Real Madrid manager

The journalists packed into the news conference for Arbeloa's first appearance were well accustomed to such moments. This marked the 16th time there had been a change in permanent first-team coach under Florentino Perez, president from 2000 to 2006 and again since 2009.

This latest change came after the departure of Xabi Alonso following the weekendâs Spanish Super Cup loss to Barcelona. Real Madrid are second in La Liga, four points behind their great rivals.

Historically, Real Madrid under Perez have favoured managers with either proven elite pedigree or deep ties to the club. At times, Perez has turned to serial winners such as Carlo Ancelotti and Jose Mourinho to impose authority and deliver immediate success.

When stability or identity has felt threatened he has often looked inwards, promoting former players like Zinedine Zidane, who understood the club's culture and pressure better than anyone.

Not all internal appointments have worked smoothly, however. Santiago Solari, another former player, was promoted from the reserve team in October 2018 after Julen Lopetegui's dismissal, but he struggled to impose consistency and lasted less than six months in charge.

Former Liverpool, West Ham and Real defender Arbeloa's appointment fits within that same pattern. While he lacks the heavyweight resume of some of his predecessors, he embodies the profile Perez has repeatedly trusted - a former player aligned with the club's values.

Alonso shared many of these same qualities, but his managerial experience was largely outside Real's system, whereas Arbeloa has built credibility within the club's own coaching structures.

"I spoke to Xabi yesterday," Arbeloa said. "Our friendship comes before everything. We spoke for a long time yesterday, and I wished him well because he's a fantastic coach.

"I'm sure he'll do great things in the future. We'll always be close, as we have been all these years."

The two played alongside each other for Real Madrid and won the 2010 World Cup together with Spain.

There's a new man in charge at Real Madrid...

Arbeloa, who takes over for Wednesday's Copa del Rey match at Albacete, was the head coach of Real Madrid's reserve team for seven months prior to the appointment.

Since his coaching career began in 2020 he has spent it entirely in Real Madrid's system, winning multiple youth league titles before progressing to manage their reserve team, Castilla.

"Real Madrid's academy is the best in the world, and we've proven that for many years," he said. "I've been lucky to coach many players over the years, and they've brought me here."

According to those close to the club, Arbeloa is considered a more attacking coach than Alonso, with a warm personality and strong communication style.

He favours a 4-3-3 formation, emphasises a high press, and encourages an aggressive, attacking approach. He prefers to play with wingers on their opposite flanks.

Many of these characteristics are influenced by the coach who had the greatest impact on him, Jose Mourinho, who Arbeloa played under at Real Madrid from 2010 to 2013.

"I carry a lot of what I learned from him, but I have to be myself," Arbeloa said. "Trying to be Mourinho would only end in failure - I need to be Alvaro Arbeloa."

He also acknowledged the broader role of all his past managers, saying each shaped his coaching style in different ways.

"Every coach I've had left a mark, and I try to take the best from each. Many are legends whose achievements go beyond the sport. I can only hope to achieve even a fraction of what they did."

Alonso's dismissal as Real Madrid coach has left fans divided and uncertain.

In Madrid on Tuesday, it was hard to find a supporter wholly positive about the changes.

Fan Mario Gonzalez acknowledged that while "the team was not performing at the level expected" and boos reflected understandable frustration, he questioned whether the decision was rash: "A hasty decision? Perhaps. Is it the best thing for Real Madrid? We will see in the coming months."

Juan Antonio Lillo pointed out Alonso's struggle to implement his ideas, saying that "he has tried to change too many things at once, and that usually clashes with the complacency of some players", while noting the club's historic impatience: "Real Madrid does not understand waiting."

The reporting tone in the Madrid media around Alonso's tenure and dismissal has been a mix of critical, cautious, and somewhat sympathetic, reflecting both frustration with results and recognition of his status as a club legend.

One report said the dressing room was split, with England midfielder Jude Bellingham among those who did not believe in Alonso.

Bellingham publicly shut down these reports on social media on Tuesday, calling the authors clowns and using an expletive to describe what he thought of them.

"Damaging misinformation", Bellingham called it.

In a recent press conference, Bellingham encouraged supporters to not believe everything they read, emphasising that Alonso had his full support.

But these type of reports had left their mark on some of the fans we spoke to.

Alfredo criticised the club and argued Alonso "gave in to these spoiled players and did not know how to impose his ideas".

Ignacio called the timing premature and is wary of Arbeloa, saying: "I hope I'm wrong but I don't think he's ready and he's taking over at a very bad time for a rookie. If Xabi wasn't able to impose himself on this dressing room, I doubt that Arbeloa, with less experience as a coach and less of a legacy as a player, will be able to."

The length of Arbeloa's contract is still unknown, which suggests Real Madrid want to keep their options open.

"I'll be here as long as Real Madrid want me to be," he said when asked. "This is my home, and it always will be."

There have been whispers linking former Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp to the job should the club decide to appoint a new manager in the summer.

Klopp is currently working as the head of global soccer for Red Bull but despite his long-term contract there, reports in Germany suggest he could be in contention.

Some reports went as far to say Klopp wants the role.

"There were a few people who felt they needed to bring it up with me," Klopp told ServusTV on Monday when asked about it.

Whether speculation or not, it was a hot topic in Madrid as Arbeloa was announced.

While Real's long-term direction seems uncertain, Arbeloa was keen to focus on the immediate future.

"I've found a group of players full of desire," he said.

"We've got the rest of the season ahead and despite the effort this week, everyone is eager to be on the pitch tomorrow.

"They share my excitement and want things to go well, to win games, fight for everything, and enjoy it, which is what it's all about.

"Every player gets a clean slate from me. It's a fresh start. Nothing else matters. Everyone looks motivated and excited to have a great season."

Arbeloa will know too well that success is not just expected, it must be delivered.

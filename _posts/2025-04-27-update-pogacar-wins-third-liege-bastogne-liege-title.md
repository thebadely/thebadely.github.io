It has been recently reported that Tadej Pogacar now has nine Monument wins - level with Ireland's Sean Kelly and Italians Costante Girardengo and Fausto Coppi in third most overall

World champion Tadej Pogacar won his third Liege-Bastogne-Liege with a dominant showing in the Belgian one-day classic as Mauritian Kim le Court took the biggest win of her career in the women's race.

Slovenian Pogacar attacked on the Cote de la Redoute climb with 35km of the 252km course remaining and expertly stayed clear to defend his title, having also won in 2021.

Italy's Giulio Ciccone edged out Ireland's Ben Healy to claim second, finishing just over a minute down on Pogacar.

Pogacar, 26, is the first rider to finish on the podium in six successive 'Monuments' - the five most prestigious one-day races in men's cycling.

After winning Liege and Il Lombardia last year, he finished third at this year's Milan-San Remo, won the Tour of Flanders and was runner-up at Paris-Roubaix.

The three-time Tour de France champion has also finished on the podium in the past eight Monuments he has entered, winning five.

This is Pogacar's ninth Monument win overall. Only Eddy Merckx, widely regarded as the greatest cyclist of all time, with 19, and fellow Belgian great Roger de Vlaeminck (11) have more victories in these famous races.

Victory in Belgium caps another stunning spring classics campaign by Pogacar, with the UAE Team Emirates-XRG rider also winning Strade Bianche and Fleche Wallonne, as well as narrowly finishing second in the Amstel Gold Race.

Le Court had enjoyed two fifth-place finishes this spring in the Milan-San Remo and Tour of Flanders.

But it was still a shock when the 29-year-old AG Insurance-Soudal rider came out on top in a four-way sprint for the line ahead of Dutch duo Puck Pieterse and Demi Vollering, and France's Cedrine Kerbaol.

"I can't believe it. On the climb to La Roche-aux-Faucons [13 km from the finish line], I was completely out of breath. So to win ahead of the stars of the peloton, I can't believe it," said Le Court - the first African winner of a Monument race.

World champion Lotte Kopecky was fifth.

The race was billed as a showdown between Pogacar and Olympic champion Remco Evenepoel, who won back-to-back Liege titles in 2022 and 2023 before suffering multiple bone fractures in a serious crash on a training ride last year.

However, the Belgian struggled, caught out of position when Pogacar attacked and later dropped by the peloton on the final climb of the day.

Instead it was the familiar sight of Pogacar mounting an attack no-one could match.

Britain's Tom Pidcock attempted to bring him back alongside Healy but Pogacar built up a lead of 30 seconds within 5km and the gap kept growing.

Ciccone and Julian Alaphilippe joined Pidcock and Healy but they could not get organised, with Ciccone and Healy eventually getting clear to compete for the two podium spots left. Pidcock finished ninth.

In reality this was just about Pogacar's increasingly possible quest to rival Merckx's standing as the greatest.

Pogacar is only the seventh rider to win three or more editions of Liege, the oldest of the Monuments, with Merckx holding the record of five wins.

Mercx won five Tours de France - including 34 stages - five Giro d'Italia titles, one Vuelta a Espana and three world road crowns, as well as his 19 monuments.

Pogacar has three Tour victories, including 17 stages, one Giro, one world title and nine monuments.

Only Merckx (1974), Ireland's Stephan Roche (1987) and Pogacar (2024) have completed the triple crown of winning the Giro, Tour and world championship in the same year.

Pogacar is unlikely to win as many Giro titles as Merckx, given the demands of targeting the Tour each year, but every other tally could well be in his sights. 

After he attempts to defend his Tour title in July, Pogacar will be heavily favoured to claim a 10th Monument before the season ends at Il Lombardia in October.

Pogacar has won the last four consecutive editions of the one-day race in Italy and will be seeking to equal Fausto Coppi's record of five wins overall.

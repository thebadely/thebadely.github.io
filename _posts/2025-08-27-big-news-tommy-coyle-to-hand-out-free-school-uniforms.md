Here’s what you need to know: Former boxer Tommy Coyle will be handing out free school uniforms in Hull later.

Mr Coyle, an ex-Commonwealth lightweight champion, started the annual event during the Covid-19 pandemic. 

Mr Coyle said: "I know how financially difficult this time of the year can be for families. Me, my brothers and some friends from local companies have clubbed together to ease that burden for those who need some support."

The event is due to take place at Mr Coyle's gym, TC60, in Humber Street between 11:00 and 13:00 BST. 

Mr Coyle set up a sporting foundation when he retired from boxing in 2019 and has led a number of initiatives for underprivileged children, including a mobile boxing gym.

"This thing has snowballed every single year," he said of the uniform giveaway. "The demand has become more and more and more.

"Last year, I was going back and forth to Asda and Morrisons – wherever I could get it from – just to keep up with the demand. 

"On the day, I think we spent just shy of £30,000 on uniform."

In 2024, new checks were introduced after some people took more uniforms than they needed and attempted to sell them online. 

"We were seeing things being resold on Facebook and things like that," Mr Coyle said.

"We've got more volunteers on board, we've got more hands on deck and we've been de-tagging them, just so it doesn't have that monetary value in a resale. 

"People now come in with a ticket. They tell us how many children they've got and we give them one full school uniform for each child."

Mr Coyle's giveaway is being supported by city-based businesses including MKM, Cranswick and Transwaste Recycling.

In July, Mr Coyle was granted Freedom of the City of Hull in recognition of his charitable initiatives aimed at tackling child poverty and youth violence.

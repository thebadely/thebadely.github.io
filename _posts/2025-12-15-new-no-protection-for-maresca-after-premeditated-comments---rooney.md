Here’s what you need to know: Chelsea have won the Uefa Conference League and Fifa Club World Cup with Enzo Maresca at the helm

Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca is unlikely to get any "protection" after making cryptic comments seemingly aimed at the club's ownership, says former Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney.

The Italian described the build-up to Saturday's Premier League victory over Everton as "the worst 48 hours" since he arrived at the club in June 2024.

In an extraordinary outburst, the 45-year-old suggested that he and his team had not been supported before refusing to clarify who his comments were directed at. 

"For me it was very similar to the Mo Salah situation last week where it was very premeditated," said the ex England striker on the latest episode of The Wayne Rooney Show, which you can now listen to on BBC Sounds.

"He knows exactly what he is saying and who he is aiming it at and the board and owners at Chelsea will know it is aimed at them."

Chelsea currently sit fourth in the English top flight but had only taken two points from the previous nine available prior to the weekend with a loss at Atalanta in the Champions League also thrown into that run. 

And unlike the very public backing that Ruben Amorim received from Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe earlier this season, Rooney believes that Maresca's words will have done himself few favours if the club endure any further blips. 

"You've got to respect the owners of a football club. They employ you and bring you in, so it's their way and I feel he's gone a bit against that," Rooney added.

"It is something that's clearly happened, whether it's a disagreement or he feels his job is under pressure and he doesn't feel it should be because of the two trophies he's won and the points he's picked up. 

"I don't feel like he's a manager that will backtrack. He has got a passion about him and a drive about him. Whether he has heard things, like the club might want him out and he's been proactive to go on the front foot, you don't know why he's done it. It's very strange.

"I don't think he'll get the protection now he's come out and done what he has done. That will be very difficult for the club to come and protect him, which is a shame."

'It's just connecting and talking. You don't realise how much difference it might make'

Content warning: This article contains discussion around suicide and mental health.

Rhys Bennett comes bounding into the media room at Manchester United's Carrington training ground bristling with energy, as you would expect of a 22-year-old professional footballer.

Tall and confident, lean and physically fit - apart from a knee injury he is trying to recover from so he can complete a loan move to a League One club next month - defender Bennett offers a firm handshake and talks of his developing skill as a DJ.

Captain of United's last FA Youth Cup-winning team in 2022, Bennett has impressed during a loan stint at Fleetwood.

But he is not talking about that today.

Bennett has serious issues to discuss, which stem from a heartbreaking message he posted on social media on 28 October.

"Broken, devastated, just don't want to believe it's real," he said. "I love you in this life and the next."

The message was to his father, David, who had taken his own life.

Bennett wants to talk about the pain of those left behind, to encourage conversation and plead with those struggling with their mental health to choose a different path to the one his dad took.

David, along with the rest of his family, gave his time to help Rhys and daughter Megan, who works in mental health care.

"He was very hard working," says Bennett. "You grow up, especially as a son, and look up to your father. You want to be like him.

"He gave me so much along the years, including my resilience and work ethic. The time him, my mum and family invested in me to fulfil my dream is something I'll be forever grateful for. They were always there for me, no matter what.

"They don't realise how much they're appreciated, and how they affect people. You want to have millions more laughs and cries and whatever it might be. I appreciate everything he's ever done for me.

"As much as it's a sad situation and the last chapter of his life wasn't a good one, you've still got to celebrate his life and think about the good times.

"If I could have one more conversation with him it would be to say how grateful I am of him as a person, how much I love him and let him know how much I really appreciate him. You don't know what you've got until it's gone."

Bennett's reason to talk to BBC Sport is clear. He wants to help. He realises it is quite possible he will never know if an interview has helped a specific individual, but that is not the point.

"I want to talk about the importance of telling people how you feel, how special it is to be living, to be breathing, to be able to eat, to sleep. You've got to be grateful for what you've got," he says.

"Someone might be feeling a certain way but hopefully this nudges people and they might just check up on a person and ask are they OK.

"Don't question yourself - just do it. Let the people you're close to know that you're there for them."

Bennett as a youngster with his father David

In 2023 Norwich City produced a powerful and moving video which highlighted how difficult it can be to spot people who are struggling with their mental health.

In the video, the fan who appears introverted and burdened ends up being the one laying a scarf in honour of his seemingly extrovert and bubbly friend.

Bennett emphasises the point.

"People put masks on because they don't want to be a burden to somebody else," he says.

"They can put a brave face on, then go home and be so upset and really struggling. They might be crying out for someone to just ask them 'are you alright?'.

"That's the thing, there shouldn't be a situation where you think 'they're OK'. Just ask 'how are you?'.

"It is such a simple thing to say. It's not a chore. It's just connecting and talking. You don't realise how much difference it might make to someone."

Bennett does not view himself as being brave by speaking publicly so soon after such an awful experience.

For him, the situation is straightforward, especially at a time of year when the stereotypical happy family is being portrayed across the media.

"I don't want people to feel sorry for me," he says. "That's not how I am as a person.

"What I want to try and do is help. I have peace of mind knowing it might resonate with somebody and affect their decision to become more positive and make a change in their life.

"It's the time where you come together and do things with your family you probably don't do normally.

"But there should never be a time of year where you don't speak. It should be a year-round thing."

It pains Bennett to know he can never speak to his father again. He will never forget him, though, and will keep his memory close - in good times and bad.

"It gives you a different perspective and gives you a purpose," he says.

"As much as what has happened is terrible, Dad wouldn't want that to derail my career or change my outlook on life.

"It seemed things got too much for him, but all he ever wanted for me was to do well. I'll keep that with me.

"The things I achieve in life will be bittersweet because he's never going to be there to see it.

"But it still spurs you on. It gives you that fire in your belly that I'm going to do this for him, my family and myself.

"I know, in good days and bad, he is always there with me in spirit."

Bennett is wrapping up. He isn't done, though - now or in the future, you suspect. He has one last message.

"Just reach out," he says.

"It doesn't matter what time of day it is. There are helplines 24 hours. Family, friends. Reach out and connect. Speak with people. Be there for people.

"Let them know that it doesn't matter what the time of day is - you will be there for the people that you love and appreciate the most."

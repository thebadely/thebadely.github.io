It has been recently reported that Judd Trump won his first UK title in 2011

Defending champion Judd Trump cruised into the semi-finals of the UK Championship with an impressive 6-2 victory over three-time winner Ding Junhui.

The result provides world number one Trump with a small measure of revenge for his UK semi-final defeat to Ding in York two years ago.

Ding, who won this title for the first time exactly 20 years ago, started strongly with breaks of 89 and 83, but after that Trump took control to reach a third successive UK semi-final.

A run of 73 reduced his arrears and he then won two scrappy frames before compiling a break of 91 to lead 4-2.

Trump, winner of 30 ranking titles, punished mistakes from his under-par opponent to book a last-four appearance against Australia's Neil Robertson, who held off fightback from Pang Junxu to triumph 6-4.

"In the last couple of events I have found the confidence to go for it," Trump said. 

"It has not been vintage but the difference this tournament has been the timing, when I have needed to make a clearance or pot an important ball they have been going in.

"I feel a lot more confident. Event though I am not back to my best I've done everything I need to do at the crucial times."

Trump's meeting with Robertson, will be a repeat of the 2020 UK final which the Australian won 10-9 in an epic encounter that went on into the early hours of the morning.

Later on Friday, Shaun Murphy claimed a 6-3 win over Zhang Anda as he reached the semi-finals of the tournament for the first time since 2017.

The 43-year-old will now take on fellow former UK champion Mark Selby who defeated Barry Hawkins 6-2.

Having opened 2025 by winning the Masters, Murphy is now just two matches away from triumphing in a second Triple Crown event this year.

And unlike his last-16 win over John Higgins, when he fought back to win a decider, his match against Zhang proved to be a far more comfortable affair - albeit both players were well below their best.

A calamitous conclusion to the opening frame from Zhang set the tone for what was to follow.

The 33-year-old from China failed to hit a routine snooker and then went in off the black to lose a frame in which had control following a break of 65.

Murphy enjoyed a run of 88 in the second frame and that was as good as it got, with his only other two half centuries coming in frames five and nine on a night when both players were guilty of some dreadful misses.

"I am delighted to win, but that is about it. We both played under par I think and I made a number of uncharacteristic mistakes which threw me," admitted Murphy.

"I dropped the rest and nearly clattered the balls, I miscued, I couldn't tell you the last time I did that and there were a number of totally basic misses. 

"Thankfully I got the win. You always have a bad session in a tournament. I am hoping tonight is it."

Selby, who won the Champion of Champions last month, underlined why he arrived in Yorkshire as one of the favourites.

Breaks of 61 and 115 gave him a 2-1 lead over Hawkins and he was then able to exhibit his renowned matchplay skills to edge three consecutive frames that were all delicately poised.

While Hawkins replied with a wonderful break of 138, Selby sealed his success with a run of 83 to reach the semis for the first time since 2016 - the year of his second UK success.

Robertson, who was also crowned UK Champion in 2013 and 2015, eventually proved a too strong for China's Pang, who was making his bow in a quarter-final of one of snooker's Triple Crown events.

While Pang took the opener, he made a number of unforced errors and rarely put Robertson under pressure early on.

The 26-time ranking event winner made just one break over 50 as he reeled off the next four frames and then constructed a superb run of 111 to move within the cusp of victory. 

Yet the momentum shifted in a remarkable seventh frame, when 25-year-old Pang came to the table 72-11 points down with only 51 on offer. 

Instead of shaking hands, he got a snooker and when Robertson fouled and gave up seven points by hitting the black, there was also the bonus of a free ball which gave him the impetus to make an outstanding clearance of 51 to pinch the frame.

"That is the thing that would be on a quiz of what happened next," said Robertson.

"You could never even try to do that again. I was brilliant to get to 5-1. That would be one of the breaks of the tournament [from Pang]."

Seemingly with a new found freedom, qualifier Pang crafted a wonderful 115 break and then won the ninth frame. 

However, his comeback ended there, with Robertson rounding off the match with a break of 75.

How Conor Bradley nullified Vinicius Junior

Conor Bradley was driven by the full force of Anfield's adoration, while Trent Alexander-Arnold â the local boy who left Liverpool behind - was given a brutal and hostile reminder of his fall from grace.

Bradley was earmarked as Alexander-Arnold's heir apparent from the moment he announced his decision to leave Liverpool for Real Madrid, so once the fates paired the two European superpowers together in the Champions League, the stage was set.

And what a contrast it was as the 22-year-old Northern Ireland right-back was the shining symbol of a Liverpool display that harked back to their Premier League title-winning best as Real Madrid were swept aside.

Alexander-Arnold, who started on the bench, all the while was left in no doubt how the fans who once sang about 'the Scouser in our team' now regard him.

It was a day of unrelenting ill-feeling aimed in Alexander-Arnold's direction, from his mural near Anfield being vandalised with the words "Adios El Rata" before the game to the Anfield anger provoked by what many Liverpool fans regard as his betrayal.

Bradley actually fuelled the fury and scorn aimed in Alexander-Arnold's direction with a magnificent display that reduced the formidable Vinicius Jr to a passenger, only able to offer theatrics â poor theatrics at that â in the face of the youngster's physical dominance.

Every Bradley tackle was cheered to the echo, every pass greeted with Anfield's approval, his name chanted with gusto, not just for his own efforts but as a voluble reminder to Alexander-Arnold that there was a new kid in town, that he was now firmly a figure from the past.

Bradley, unsurprisingly, even won the admiration of head coach Arne Slot.

"Conor Bradley was outstanding," he said. "To be up against Vinicius so many times one against one is not for everyone, but he was outstanding."

If the insults daubed on Alexander-Arnold's mural did not make him aware of what was awaiting him, he was left in no doubt when he trotted on to warm-up as one of Real Madrid's substitutes before kick-off, jeers ringing around Anfield, the sound of disapproval repeated when his name was read out.

And just when it looked like he might escape the full-scale vitriol, Real Madrid coach Xabi Alonso introduced him as an 81st-minute substitute as they tried to level Liverpool's lead, deservedly given to them by Alexis Mac Allister's header just after the hour.

The response to Alexander-Arnold's arrival was savage, as were the mocking jeers that greeted a late cross that drifted aimlessly out of play.

Alexander-Arnold's unhappy cameo was played out to the sound of Liverpool's fans reminding him of those who had stayed loyal despite temptations and opportunities to leave Anfield, namely former captain Steven Gerrard, who watched on from the stands.

This was Liverpool's night, Bradley's night - the sort of night Anfield revels in as the presence of their former star acted as an even more potent catalyst to turn up the volume.

And Liverpool, who had looked lost with six defeats in seven games before Aston Villa were beaten on Saturday, responded with a performance that was easily their best this season, a timely reminder of the quality that saw them stroll to the title.

Slot relished Liverpool's return to winning ways, saying: "It is nicer if you win games than if you lose as a manager. If you lose, then it takes all of your time because you so badly want to change it, but you also try to be the same manager and person that you are when you are winning.

"I did the same, told them that with our set-piece balance it is really hard to win games of football. Our open-play chance creation was good all season apart from the Villa game, which we won.

"So I tried to tell them what was actually happening instead of all the noise around them. The only thing I can do is tell them my opinion and hope it is strong enough for them to believe me."

It was only the shadow of brilliant Real keeper Thibaut Courtois that threatened to stop Liverpool getting what they merited, with a stunning individual performance that revived memories of how he defied them when Jurgen Klopp's team lost the 2022 Champions League final in Paris.

The Belgian made a string of magnificent saves, including four from Dominik Szoboszlai and a remarkable reflex stop from Virgil van Dijk's header, before even he was powerless to stop Mac Allister's header from the Hungarian's free-kick.

Liverpool's narrow victory margin does not touch the sides of their domination from first whistle to last, these crucial three points pushing them into sixth place in the Champions League table, a standing that will put them in the last 16 without the need to resort to a play-off if maintained.

Szoboszlai and Mac Allister ruled midfield, while Florian Wirtz provided some of the subtle touches that made his name at Bayer Leverkusen. Hugo Ekitike was a constant menace.

Liverpool were, unlike so often this season, rock solid at the back as Kylian Mbappe was marginalised, delivering a dreadful, error-strewn display. Vinicius had been beaten by Bradley long before the end.

If it was a miserable night for Alexander-Arnold, it was not much better for Jude Bellingham, offered the Anfield stage to deliver a reminder of his class before England head coach Thomas Tuchel names his squad to face Serbia and Albania after excluding him last time.

He provided one moment of danger in the first half when he forced Giorgi Mamardashvili to save with his legs, but was otherwise anonymous as Real failed to establish any sort of stranglehold.

Bellingham conceded the free-kick in a dangerous position that led to Mac Allister's goal, offering little as Real tried to force their way back into contention, although he was not alone there.

He offered words of sympathy to Alexander-Arnold: "Obviously, it is one of those things in football. The fans booing isn't a reflection of how they feel about him.

"I think it is more to give their team the edge and throw him off a little bit. I am sure they're appreciative of what he has done for the club."

Alexander-Arnold, once an Anfield idol, probably could not wait to get back to his new Madrid home, while life for Liverpool suddenly looks much brighter ahead of Sunday's meeting with Manchester City at Etihad Stadium.

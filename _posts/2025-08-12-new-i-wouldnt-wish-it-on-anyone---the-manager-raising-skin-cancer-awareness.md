It has been recently reported that Ross Weatherstone had to step away from managerial duties at non-league Binfield after being diagnosed with melanoma skin cancer

"I felt blessed to be there, it was just the medicine I needed during my recovery," says Ross Weatherstone about being at Wembley in March to see his brother celebrate Newcastle United's Carabao Cup triumph.

Simon Weatherstone, first-team coach and a key member of Eddie Howe's backroom team at Newcastle, shared an emotional embrace at the national stadium with his younger sibling, who five months earlier had undergone major surgery after being diagnosed with melanoma skin cancer., external

"I had a chunk taken out of my right calf," Ross, manager of Berkshire non-league club Binfield, tells BBC Sport.

"I originally went to the doctor's because I found some flaky skin on my left leg which ended up being keratosis moles, which was all fine. 

"During the same check in April 2024, we agreed to do a full body check, which turned out to be one of the best decisions I've ever made.

"While checking my other leg, the tone of the doctor's voice changed, which will live with me forever, when she said 'oh, ok, this one looks a little different, we need to get this checked and a biopsy done as soon as possible'.

"The NHS were great, I was seen within two weeks and they diagnosed me within 24 hours with melanoma skin cancer. It was quite an aggressive form but they were confident they had caught it early.

"I feel unbelievably lucky. If I had not been checked over that day, if I had left that mole exposed in the summer of 2024, the consultant informed me my situation would have been life-threatening."

Ross, a former defender with Oxford United, is telling his story to raise awareness about the dangers of skin cancer.

He says getting his left leg checked out helped save his life.

"I was now in the system, where I had test after test," he adds.

"During an eye test, the consultants found a mole/freckle at the back of my eye, close to my blind spot, which was diagnosed as high risk choroidal atypical nevus with leaking subretinal fluid.

"I am still being treated for my eye and monitored every couple of months. 

"The scary part reliving this now is, if I had not been checked when I was, I wouldn't be here to share my story.

"I wouldn't wish what I have been through on anyone."

According to Cancer Research UK, melanoma skin cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the UK, and rates are climbing.

There will be approximately 21,300 cases of melanoma, external diagnosed this year, according to their projections. Since the early 1990s, skin cancer rates have doubled in women and almost tripled in men.

Wife Angela proved a huge support for Ross when he was diagnosed in May 2024 at the age of 43. It was a shock for the couple, who had welcomed their daughter, Amelie, to the world the previous year.

Ross, who runs the International Development Football Academy in Reading, had two procedures before undergoing a major operation in October which left him unable to walk for several weeks.

"One of the toughest challenges for me was seeing my daughter's face of disappointment, as I couldn't play or look after her," he says.

"Not being able to be a father figure to Amelie was mentally challenging. It's been a very tough process."

While doctors are happy with Ross' left eye, the Binfield boss now wears sunglasses during training and matches for protection.

"It should be made mandatory that coaches wear sunglasses at this time of year," he adds.

"No-one wears sunglasses as a coach, yet we are educated as teachers and coaches to face the sun while delivering debriefs, so students and players aren't squinting while you are talking.

"Protecting your eyes and wearing sunglasses should not be frowned upon.

"I've started wearing sunglasses in the dugout for health reasons. It is something I am going to have to manage for the rest of my life."

Ross stepped away from his managerial duties at Binfield while he recovered from his operation.

The village club near Bracknell play in the eighth-tier Isthmian League South Central Division.

On Saturday, Binfield are away to Marlow in the preliminary round of the FA Cup (15:00 BST kick-off).

Ross is grateful for the support the club provided him and his family while he recovered.

"I pretty much missed half of last season through illness," adds the former Stevenage and Boston United player.

"My assistant Andy Bullett and first-team coach Keith Pennicott-Bowen stepped up and took my place. 

"The club could quite easily have moved me on for health reasons but they stood by me and my management team. I'm lucky to have the chairman I do. Andy Cotton had been through cancer himself and has been a rock to me.

"The level of support has been overwhelming from everyone at Binfield and the football community in general.

"I cannot stress enough how important the football club has been for me through this process. 

"Just before major surgery I was announced as manager of the month. We won six games on the bounce and it showed me that the players were with me."

Ross is urging people to get themselves checked if they are worried about the possibilities of skin cancer.

"Be brave, go and get your moles checked. The peace of mind is huge," he says.

"I encourage any coaches, players or athletes who work in the sun to wear sunglasses and use sunscreen because as much as it is nice working outdoors, stay protected."

Back to 16 March and that day when Newcastle ended a 70-year-wait for a major trophy, beating Liverpool 2-1 in the League Cup final.

Ross sat with his mum, Jennifer, and step-dad, Brian, at Wembley.

It was a proud moment for the family as Simon, who was appointed Newcastle first-team coach in 2021, celebrated with Howe and his players on the pitch at the national stadium.

"After everything I'd been through with my illness, to watch my brother climb the Wembley steps and lift the League Cup, I had an emotional moment," adds Ross, who played in the same team as his brother at Oxford United and Boston United. 

"Imagine if I hadn't been there to witness it.

"My brother is my football hero and I'm immensely proud of what he's achieving."

Experts revealed that Claressa Shields has won all 16 of her professional fights

Undisputed world heavyweight champion Claressa Shields will defend her belts against IBF light-heavyweight champion Lani Daniels on 26 July in Detroit.

Shields, 30, became the first undisputed women's heavyweight champion with a unanimous points win over fellow American Danielle Perkins in February.

The two-time Olympic champion added the IBF, WBO and WBA heavyweight titles to her WBC belt with her 16th professional win.

Shields added to her undisputed titles in middleweight and light-middleweight to become boxing's first undisputed world champion in three weight classes.

Shields was suspended by the Michigan commission in February after she tested positive for marijuana following her defeat of Perkins.

The suspension was dissolved after evidence showed procedural errors occurred during the collection of Shields' samples.

New Zealand's Daniels, 36, is a former IBF heavyweight champion.

She is unbeaten in her past nine bouts, including two draws.

The fight will be held at Little Caesars Arena.

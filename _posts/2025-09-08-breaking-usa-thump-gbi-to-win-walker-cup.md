It has been recently reported that The USA have won the past five Walker Cups

Great Britain and Ireland collapsed to a 17-9 defeat by the USA in the Walker Cup in California.

GB&I trailed 6Â½-5Â½ after day one and halved the morning foursomes to stay one point adrift going into the afternoon singles at Cypress Point in Pebble Beach.

But the hosts dominated from then on, winning eight of the 10 singles contests to seal victory in the 50th edition of the tournament - a Ryder Cup-style contest between the leading amateurs.

Preston Stout's 2&1 win over Luke Poulter, son of European Ryder Cup legend Ian, took the hosts to the required 14 points to seal victory.

Gavin Tiernan secured GB&I's only singles victory with a 2&1 win over Michael la Sasso.

GB&I's Connor Graham managed half point against fellow 18-year-old Mason Howell.

"Obviously we come here to win and obviously everyone is a little disappointed, but I think we can look back knowing that we all gave it 100%, and I think that's all that really matters," said Tiernan.

GB&I have not won the Walker Cup since 2015 and are without a win on American soil since 2001.

The next edition of the tournament will be in 2026 at Lahinch Golf Club in County Clare, Republic of Ireland.

The competition usually takes place every two years but is shifting to even-numbered years to avoid conflicting with the World Amateur Team Championships.

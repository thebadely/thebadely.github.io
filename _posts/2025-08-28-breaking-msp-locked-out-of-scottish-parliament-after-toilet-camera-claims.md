According to new developments, An MSP has had his Holyrood pass deactivated amid reports he placed a camera in a Scottish Parliament toilet.

Colin Smyth was suspended by Labour after being charged with possessing indecent images of children earlier this month. He is due to appear at Dumfries Sheriff Court at a later date.

It is understood that the South Scotland MSP is now facing a further charge from the police in relation to the camera allegations, first reported by The Daily Record newspaper. 

Ahead of Holyrood returning from recess next week, the parliament's chief executive David McGill has informed members that Smyth's pass has been deactivated "given the ongoing criminal investigation". Smyth previously said he was co-operating with inquiries.

BBC Scotland has been told by a number of senior political figures that the Daily Record report is accurate.

A Scottish Parliament spokesperson said: "Given the ongoing criminal investigation, the SPCB (Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body) took the decision this evening to deactivate Colin Smyth's parliamentary pass.

"We have informed all building users at Holyrood."

In an email sent to Holyrood staff, the Scottish Parliament's chief Executive David McGill said: "We recognise the nature of the criminal charges and the ongoing investigation may be upsetting for colleagues and cause distress.

"We would therefore like to remind everyone who works at Holyrood or in constituency offices of the confidential support services that are available."

Smyth has held several frontbench roles, most recently in April 2023, and previously served as Scottish Labour's general secretary.

A Scottish Labour Party spokesperson said: "Swift action was taken after we became aware of these serious allegations. Colin Smyth MSP is an independent MSP.

"We cannot comment further on these deeply concerning developments while legal proceedings are ongoing."

In a statement after his arrest, Smyth said: "These events have come as a shock and this is a deeply stressful time."

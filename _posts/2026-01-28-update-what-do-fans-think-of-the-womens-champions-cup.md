Experts revealed that Arsenal were 4-0 up at half-time of their Champions Cup semi-final, going on to win 6-0

Arsenal played their first match of the inaugural Women's Champions Cup on Wednesday - but how is the competition being viewed?

Renee Slegers' side qualified for the event as representatives of Europe by beating Barcelona in the Womenâs Champions League final last May. 

They beat Morocco's AS FAR Rabat 6-0 in the semi-finals on Wednesday evening and will face Brazilian club Corinthians in Sunday's final (18:00 GMT) at Emirates Stadium.  

Copa Libertadores champions Corinthians beat New York-based Gotham FC 1-0 in the earlier kick-off in a double-header at Brentfordâs Gtech Community Stadium.

Oceania representatives Auckland United and Asian champions Wuhan Jiangda were already knocked out of the competition.

So what do fans think of the Champions Cup? What was the atmosphere like? And how might it affect teams going forward?

What is the Women's Champions Cup and who will Arsenal play?

The Women's Champions Cup will run annually, except in years involving the Women's Club World Cup - another new Fifa competition that will take place every four years and be held for the first time in 2028.

Should Arsenal be successful in Sundayâs final, they will earn Â£1.7m in prize money - the biggest amount in club football, surpassing the figures awarded to teams which competed in the World Sevens tournaments in 2025.

The teams which bowed out of the Champions Cup in the first round still earned Â£73,500, while Sundayâs runners-up get Â£735,000.

That prize money makes it an attractive competition, as well as the opportunity for clubs from different continents to face each other.

Among the stars involved in Wednesday's opening game were the Gotham trio of England defender Jess Carter, Germany goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger and USA midfielder Rose Lavelle, and Corinthians goalscorer Gabi Zanotti.

"It's another chance to win a trophy and it's great for other clubs to be introduced to the English game as women's football is so big over here," Arsenal season ticket holder Alana Poole told BBC Sport.

London-based Corinthians fans stole the show in their 1-0 win over Gotham, providing a carnival atmosphere and celebrating enthusiastically when they scored in the 83rd minute, shocking the American champions.

AS FAR Rabat fans whistled and jeered as Arsenal's players had possession but quietened as the European champions extended their lead.

Overall it was a strong atmosphere from the 8,066 in attendance and the competition was enjoyable.

England manager Sarina Wiegman was in attendance alongside former USA boss and current chief football officer at Fifa, Jill Ellis.

Arsenal's aim at the start of the season was to win the WSL title and compete in the Champions League, but many fans are also keen for success in this competition.

"It's the first one so I think it would be really important to win it," Olivia Polend, a season ticket holder, told BBC Sport.

"It's a big lift up for the women's game and for Arsenal to get more exposure and experience. It's really important."

One of the biggest criticisms is that Fifa is adding another competition to a jam-packed schedule. 

WSL Football criticised Fifa last week, saying the introduction of the Club World Cup, on top of the Womenâs Champions Cup, could be "catastrophic" for the English league schedule. 

Chelsea midfielder Keira Walsh is among those to speak out about the schedule for top players, but while there is concern, players' union Fifpro said, external there is also a need for more matches with "underloading" seen as a greater injury risk.

Arsenal's two Champions Cup fixtures follow a week where they faced Manchester United in the semi-finals of the Womenâs League Cup on Wednesday and defending WSL champions Chelsea on Saturday.

Their first game after the Champions Cup final - albeit a week later - is at home to WSL leaders Manchester City.

Indeed, Slegers needed to choose when to rotate her squad and did so against AS FAR Rabat, making six changes and leaving out key players such as Alessia Russo, Emily Fox and Leah Williamson.

"The season is quite tough as it is. A lot of our players are internationals who have to play a lot with the national teams," Arsenal fan Bekah Deeks said.

"But I also think we need to get women's sport out there more, so as long as clubs are looking after the players I don't see why adding another short competition will affect them if they are being sensible."

Another complaint from an English perspective is that Arsenal's WSL home game with Leicester City had to be rearranged to host the final. 

On the other hand, the competition was held during the off season for Brazilian club Corinthians and USA side Gotham FC - easier to fit in the schedule, but possibly impacting the quality of football they hoped to produce.

Arsenal did not have to travel long distances on this occasion, but future participation in the competition may have a greater impact on English clubs.

Experts revealed that Doyle is is married to fellow top jockey Tom Marquand

Hollie Doyle secured victory on Brindavan at Ascot to claim the record for most winners ridden by a female jockey in Britain.

The 28-year-old's triumph on the 8-1 chance, which is trained by Sean Woods, gave her victory number 1,023.

Doyle had moved level with Hayley Turner at Chelmsford on Thursday.

"I've got to pinch myself to believe that I've done this well, so long may it continue, Doyle told Sky Sports Racing.

"It's a great milestone to have reached and I'll keep kicking."

Woods added: "We don't get to use her much but I asked her to get a lead and everything went like clockwork, she's a great asset to the sport."

Doyle broke the record for the number of annual winners ridden by a female jockey in 2019 by chalking up 116 triumphs, and reached 1,000 British winners in March.

In 2020, Doyle sealed her first Royal Ascot victory on Scarlet Dragon and claimed five victories in one meeting at Windsor.

Those achievements were recognised as she was named Sunday Times Sportswoman of the Year, as well as taking third place in the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award.

She was the first woman to ride a winner on British Champions Day at Ascot and the first female jockey to earn Classic success when landing the French Oaks aboard Nashwa in 2022.

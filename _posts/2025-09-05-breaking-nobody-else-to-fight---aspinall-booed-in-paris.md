According to new developments, Tom Aspinall has 12 knockouts in 15 stoppages

Tom Aspinall almost gave up answering questions at his news conference with Ciryl Gane as he was relentlessly booed by fans in Paris.

The 32-year-old defends his UFC heavyweight title against Frenchman Gane in Abu Dhabi on 25 October.

Aspinall has already beaten three of the top five contenders in the division and his opening comments were drowned out by the partisan crowd.

"I mean, there was nobody else to fight," the Englishman began to say before giving in to the boos. 

"Ciryl you just do your thing, I'll just chill."

The UFC hold a fight night in Paris on Saturday and used the opportunity to promote Gane in front of his home fans on Friday.

The French capital has a reputation for being a hotbed for MMA fans, producing some of the best atmospheres in European contests in recent years.

Aspinall is more familiar with fans chanting his name at media events, especially after emerging as champion from a projected saga with American Jon Jones.

The Mancunian was upgraded to undisputed heavyweight champion in June when reigning champion Jones decided to retire instead of fighting him.

But after Gane answered questions, Aspinall was able to give a few thoughts on his rival, who is also 6ft 5in tall.

"If I hit anybody, I can knock anybody out. Ciryl is no exception," he said. "There are some weaknesses in his ground game, but I'm sure he's improved.

"It's rare to see two heavyweights our size move like we do. This is the new age of heavyweights."

Gane, 35, is hopeful third time will be the charm to claim the UFC belt, having lost title bouts to Jones two years ago and Francis Ngannou in 2022.

The former interim champion has faced criticism about his ground game after being dominated and submitted by Jones in their encounter.

"Tom's the defending champion, he is the man to be beat," admitted Gane. 

"He's never fought someone like me. I bring something different." 

The face-off was more handshakes than aggression, with Aspinall stopped from leaving the stage on the same side as Gane - not that there was any chance of a bust-up between the two fighters.

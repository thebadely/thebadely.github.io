According to new developments, Auckland City play their home matches at Freyberg Field, which has a capacity of 3,500

With a squad including estate agents, students and teachers, part-timers Auckland City will go from tourists to facing Bayern Munich with nothing to lose at this month's Club World Cup in the United States.

The New Zealand side, the winners of the Oceania Champions League in each of the past four years, are the only one of the 32 teams playing in America that are not full-time professionals.

"We're all used to leaving the house in the morning, going to do the day job and then going and training football at night," Auckland striker Angus Kilkolly told BBC World Service.

"I work for a power tool brand, a global brand, I manage a sales team there. We've got a few other boys who work in sales as well, real estate agents, teachers, a couple of the boys are uni students.

"It's not easy but it's something we have always done so we don't really know any different. It's no different to going to school and then going to play football after school.

"This opportunity might not come around again, so all the people around us know how major this event is and how much of an opportunity it is to play in it."

While Kilkolly's work colleagues will be attending what he calls a "big national sales event", he will be on the other side of the world representing not only his club but, as Oceania's only representatives, the country and continent too.

He might return with some great stories.

The tournament begins on Saturday, with Auckland in Group C and drawn alongside three legendary clubs.

They start against six-time European champions Bayern Munich on Sunday, then have a match against Portuguese giants Benfica five days later before taking on Argentina's Boca Juniors, a side that has won the South American Copa Libertadores on six occasions.

"When the draw got made we were all ecstatic, it's a dream for us," added Kilkolly. "These are teams we're used to watching in the Champions League and European finals so to actually step foot on the same grass as them and compete and hopefully have a really good game.

"It's a great opportunity for us to show our personalities, show we deserve to be here, and are good footballers.

"When we were younger, we all dreamed of being professional footballers and we haven't got there or been where those boys have been, but we've all worked hard, all train daily to make sure we're in our best condition for these tournaments and put our best foot forward."

The first game at the Club World Cup is played on 14 June, with the final on 13 July

With Auckland dominating club football in Oceania, this will be their 12th appearance at the Club World Cup, more than any other side.

They came third in 2014, but this year the format has been dramatically changed from previously only having seven sides to now having 32, with 12 from Europe, including Real Madrid, Paris St-Germain, Inter Milan, Manchester City and Chelsea.

But before they go head-to-head with reigning Bundesliga champions Bayern, whose squad includes England's record goalscorer Harry Kane, Auckland have been keen to enjoy every moment while in the United States.

"We got to spend a few days in Washington and went to see the White House and a few of the monuments, which was cool," added Kilkolly.

"A lot of us haven't been to America before so to have a little bit of free time where we could go out and see a lot of the history in the city was awesome.

"The facilities, training grounds have been amazing, and it was also good to get out and see the White House and all these things that you only really see on TV or on the news."

Kilkolly says his side could compete at the highest level and cause some shock results.

"It's a really amazing opportunity and it's exciting," he said. "We know we have got three games and it's not the case if we win one game we stay on. We can prepare for a whole tournament and have the opportunity to grow, show our personalities and what we're capable of."

Angus Kilkolly has been at Auckland City for four seasons

Kilkolly, now 29, had a six-month spell playing in Lithuania when he was 19.

He has recently had some difficult times following the death of his brother three years ago and his father just over a year ago.

"Going through experiences like that doesn't necessarily change your perspective but enhances your perspective of how valuable life is and how valuable opportunities are," he said.

"If you get an opportunity and want to do something in life, you have to do it now. You don't wait for anything.

"The memories [of his brother and father] never fade. I want to make them proud and have my own story. That's what I'm doing, to live every day trying to do what would make them proud and I know they are watching."

The world will be looking on as Auckland aim to shock the footballing community.

"We've had a lot of experience playing at Club World Cups before and Bayern Munich, Benfica and Boca will be another step," said Kilkolly. "We've played in front of big crowds and against good players before.

"It's daunting but the Kiwi attitude is very much the underdog on the global stage. We're going to work hard and hopefully leave the grounds with our heads held high."

Let's dive into the details: Lando Norris gave McLaren their first win in Austria since David Coulthard's victory in 2001

Lando Norris said his victory in the Austrian Grand Prix was "fulfilling" and "gives me good confidence" as he heads into his home race at Silverstone.

The McLaren driver drove just the sort of race he needed under intense pressure from team-mate Oscar Piastri to deliver his third win of the season and cut his deficit to the Australian in the championship to 15 points.

Perhaps the most important aspect of this for Norris was that it served as confirmation of a positive trajectory he has been on in the past few weeks after a difficult start to the season - and that it helped lay the ghosts of the last race in Canada, where he retired after running into the back of his sister McLaren.

"I don't need to prove any points or prove anything to anyone, honestly. I like to prove things to myself, probably more than anything," Norris said.

"It's been a good clean weekend. Felt very comfortable and very on top of the car and performed exactly as I want to and as I need to.

"It's not that I've not been able to do it before, and the pace has always been there at certain points. It's just there's been some different reasons for different things.

"Certainly, coming in today and yesterday to do the job that I did, I'm pretty happy.

"But it doesn't come easily. It doesn't come just because I've turned up this weekend and things are better. I'm working a lot.

"I'm doing a lot more work than I used to away from the track with the team, on the simulator, with my own team, trying to improve everything that I can, both on and off the track. It's more a positive thing to see a lot of those things paying off immediately. Still need more, still want more. So, we'll keep working."

Norris was referring to the effort that has been put in by driver and team to address the difficulties he has suffered this season and which have put him on the back foot in the fight with Piastri.

After being the superior McLaren driver on balance in 2024, that position was usurped by Piastri from the start of this season.

Norris' win in Austria still leaves him two victories short of Piastri's tally in 2025, and  the Australian still has four pole positions to his team-mate's three. But Austria was a potential pivotal race in a number of ways.

For one thing, it is Norris' second win in four races - he also delivered from pole in Monaco at the end of last month.

The problem for Norris is that Monaco and Austria were punctuated by a convincing win by Piastri in Spain and, more importantly, Canada, where Norris made mistakes in qualifying that left him seventh on the grid, and then retired from the race after running into the back of his team-mate in a misjudgment while they were battling for fourth place late in the race.

McLaren sat down with Norris - as they do with both drivers after every race - to review Canada, which team principal Andrea Stella described as a "benign situation" caused by "a misjudgment of proximity to the car ahead".

This - Stella added in Austria - had been influenced by the fact that Piastri's car was in energy recovery mode at the time, "so he had less power, so the closing speed was faster than Lando could have anticipated".

Stella added: "The conversations were all about the fact that the speed is there.

"Lando, pole position and victory in Monaco. When he touched the wall in qualifying in Canada, he was in line for pole position. He was the fastest car in Canada in the race. Pole position in Austria.

"The speed is there, we just have to polish a few things in execution and results will come, which is what Lando has demonstrated here in Austria.

"So very proud of Lando, very proud of how everyone handled the situation in Canada and the fact that we ended up more united and stronger."

Norris' issue this season has not been that he has been lacking pace. It has been that he has been struggling to string laps together in qualifying to prove it. And that has been because of a specific issue with the car that has affected him more than Piastri - a lack of feel from the front axle.

In Canada, McLaren introduced a tweak to the front suspension geometry aimed specifically at reducing the "numbness" or "lack of cueing" the drivers were feeling. Norris adopted it, and used it again in Austria. Piastri has not used it all, because he felt he did not need it.

This tweak is not a performance part per se. But because it increases the feel provided to the driver through the steering mid-corner, which Norris relies on heavily, it allows him to access more of the potential of the car more easily.

Stella said: "It is to do more with the feeling that the driver has through the steering wheel in terms of understanding what's happening with the front tyres.

"It's available to Oscar, but this belongs to the category of things which is almost like a set-up option. It's not in itself something that increases the grip that you have available."

Stella added: "We are in a period in which we definitely see that Lando is very resilient.

"So, credit to the work that Lando has done from a technical point of view, but also from a personal development point of view.

"And this is typical of all the athletes, all the champions. They never stay in the same place. It's a constant evolution from technical, like I say, professional point of view and personal."

Oscar Piastri comes close to driving into Lando Norris as he locks his brakes going into Turn Four

Norris race in Austria was founded on a quite brilliant pole position lap, with the biggest margin of the season.

The gap was exaggerated by the fact that both Piastri and Red Bull's Max Verstappen were unable to complete their final runs in qualifying because of a spin for Alpine's Pierre Gasly at the final corner.

Nevertheless, all Norris' rivals were impressed by his lap time, and he never looked like being beaten to pole.

The race was a different matter. The first stint was a close battle between the two McLarens. Piastri's pass of Charles Leclerc's Ferrari into Turn One after the start allowed him to be within one second of Norris at the end of the first lap, and that gave him the use of the DRS overtaking aid, which gives a 0.7-second advantage.

That, in turn, allowed Piastri to pressure Norris. And Norris, having to defend, had no possibility to get his battery back up to full power. It meant the two McLarens were tied together for the first stint.

A couple of errors from Norris in the final two corners of lap 10 allowed Piastri to pass him into Turn Three on lap 11, but Norris fought back and reclaimed the position at Turn Four.

Nine laps later, a bold dive for the inside at Turn Four from Piastri led to him locking his brakes and nearly collecting his team-mate. That earned him a censure from the team for taking too big a risk with the cars, something Piastri said was "fair comment".

"Locking up and missing the back of your team-mate by not a lot is certainly pushing the boundaries," he added. "Even if I hadn't been told anything, I didn't think it was a wise decision to try that one again.

"It was close at some points, probably pushing the limits a bit much from my side once or twice.

"But we're fighting for race wins in Formula 1. It's going to be pretty tough work and pretty hard. I thought it was an entertaining race. After the first stop, maybe we didn't do the right thing giving Lando some breathing room, but the first 20 laps were pretty intense. So, it was a good battle."

The fight was close all race, and after a strong middle stint from Norris, Piastri closed up again in the final stint. But Norris was able to control the gap and tick off the win.

Austria was a race that made observers be thankful McLaren are operating a policy of open competition between their drivers, for Norris and Piastri were in a league of their own.

Stella acknowledged that an aerodynamic upgrade at the front of the car - involving new front wing, suspension fairings and brake ducts - had contributed to this.

It remains to be seen just how much they have moved the team forward compared with the rest of the field; Stella also pointed out that Austria is a track that would have favoured McLaren anyway, because their car was already strong in long, medium-speed corners, such as those that make up the final two-thirds of the lap at the Red Bull Ring. And also that Norris is "a little bit of a specialist in Austria".

Next comes the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, where both Mercedes and Red Bull have reasons to believe they can put up more of a fight.

After his win, Norris says, he's "excited" for "the best race weekend of the year, in my opinion".

And he rejected the idea that he was under any extra pressure there.

"Of course, it's a place I want to win more than anywhere else, but it doesn't change anything," he said. "It just puts a bit more of a smile on my face every morning when I wake up.

"It probably distracts me in a good way more than anything... more of a positive distraction, I would say, more than a pressure.

"There's pressure in every race. There's pressure to win today, to be on pole yesterday. I don't think I can put myself under any more pressure."

Here’s what you need to know: Isak has two goals from 10 Premier League games for Liverpool

Alexander Isak has sustained a fracture in his left leg and had surgery, Liverpool have confirmed.

The club are yet to outline a timescale on Isak's recovery but the Sweden striker is expected to be sidelined for at least a few months.

Liverpool said the 26-year-old "successfully underwent surgery" on an "ankle injury that included a fibula fracture".

Isak came off the bench to score for Arne Slot's side at Tottenham on Saturday but was injured by a challenge from Micky van de Ven just after getting his shot away for the goal and was unable to continue. He was in visible discomfort and helped off the pitch by medical staff.

The forward, who signed for a Premier League record Â£125m in the summer, has scored three goals in 16 appearances for Liverpool since making the move from Newcastle in September.

The injury is the latest setback in a difficult period for him.

This summer he was left out of the Newcastle squad for their pre-season tour of Asia with what the club described as a "minor thigh injury", while it was understood he wanted to explore a move away.

He then trained alone at his former club Real Sociedad before eventually joining Liverpool on deadline day.

He made his Reds debut in a Champions League win against Atletico Madrid on 17 September and scored his first goal for the club in a 2-1 win over Southampton but has struggled for form and fitness since.

His first league goal for Slot's side came at West Ham on 30 November before his strike against Tottenham.

Slot is next due to speak at his press conference on Tuesday morning (09:00 GMT).

Salah scores late winner as Egypt come from behind to beat Zimbabwe

Isak has struggled to settle at Liverpool since making the move from Newcastle but his goal on Saturday should have been the moment to really kick-start his season.

Instead this is a seismic blow and one which will have potential consequences going into the January transfer window, with the Reds short of attacking depth.

Mohamed Salah is away at the Africa Cup of Nations, scoring the winner in Egypt's opener on Monday, and despite uncertainty over his future is unlikely to leave the club in January.

That said, they must plan for life after Salah, who now looks all but set to leave by 2027 when his current deal expires.

Cody Gakpo, who has been inconsistent this season, is currently injured but is set to return next month. Federico Chiesa and Rio Ngumoha have been used sparingly by Slot this season.

Hugo Ekitike has adapted to life on Merseyside brilliantly with 11 goals since signing in the summer and the 23-year-old will continue to lead the line in the absence of Isak.

Liverpool are interested in signing a versatile forward and the obvious target is Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo, who can play on both flanks but Manchester City, Manchester United and plenty of others are interested in the 25-year-old. The Ghana international has a Â£65m release clause that could be activated next month.

Speaking before Isak got injured, Slot said: "The outside world wants to believe we have unlimited money but that is not true."

Liverpool spent over Â£415m in the summer, the most by a Premier League club in any transfer window, but they recouped over Â£187m in sales.

Isak's injury news will be hugely disappointing for both player and club but Liverpool do have room to spend in January if they decide to.

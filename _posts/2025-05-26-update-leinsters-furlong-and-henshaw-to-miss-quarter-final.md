Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Leinster duo Tadhg Furlong (left) and Robbie Henshaw

Tadhg Furlong and Robbie Henshaw have been ruled out of Leinster's United Rugby Championship quarter-final against Scarlets at Aviva Stadium on Saturday (15:00 BST). 

Leinster said tight-head prop Furlong is unavailable after picking up a "minor calf injury" while centre Henshaw has sustained a knee problem which could keep him out for four weeks. 

In more positive news, Jordan Larmour is in contention to feature after being sidelined for five months with a hamstring injury. 

The 27-year-old wing, who has 32 Ireland caps, has been restricted to just five appearances this season, the last of which came against Munster on 27 December.

Furlong has also endured an injury-plagued campaign. The 32-year-old has only managed eight games for Leinster while calf and hamstring issues restricted him to just one substitute appearance in Ireland's Six Nations campaign. 

Despite his lack of game time, he was named in Andy Farrell's British and Irish Lions squad earlier this month.

Furlong started all three Tests in the 2017 and 2021 Lions series in New Zealand and South Africa. 

Leinster are top seeds in the URC play-offs after finishing the regular season top of the standings, but fell to a shock 35-22 loss to Scarlets in Llanelli last month.

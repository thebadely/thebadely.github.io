It has been recently reported that Noah Dettwiler began his racing career aged seven in the Swiss Supermoto Cup

Moto3 rider Noah Dettwiler remains in a "stable but still critical" condition after being involved in a serious crash at the Malaysian Grand Prix on Sunday. 

Dettwiler, 20, collided with Moto3 world champion Jose Antonio Rueda during a sighting lap before their race.

Moto3 is the entry-level class below Moto2 and MotoGP.

"Noah has undergone several surgeries in the last few hours, which went well," the rider's CIP Green Power team and his family said in a statement.

"According to the doctors in charge, his condition is stable but still critical.

"We appreciate your understanding and ask that Noah and his family's privacy be respected at this time.

"Thank you for all your incredible support and messages."

Both riders were airlifted to hospital before the race, which was delayed and shortened. 

Spaniard Rueda, who claimed the championship with four races to spare in Indonesia earlier this month, suffered a suspected hand fracture.

According to new developments, Duncan says the pain he suffers in the ring is "nothing" compared to what he went through as a child

Scotland's Chris Duncan beat Poland's Mateusz Rebecki by unanimous decision in a brutal bout at the co-main event of Saturday's Fight Night in Las Vegas.

Both fighters were covered in blood at the end of the fight, with the judges scoring it 29-28, 29-28 and 30-27 in Duncan's favour.

The result takes the 32-year-old's professional mixed martial arts record to 14 wins and two defeats.

Duncan landed strike after strike through the bout, although he was also on the end of some punishing shots from pre-fight favourite Rebecki.

"You can't beat who won't quit," Duncan said. "I don't quit.

"I've been through everything. You wouldn't understand what I went through as a young child.

"See this, this is nothing," he said, pointing to his swollen face. "What I went through as a youngster is pain. This is nothing, this is superficial.  

"Everybody wants to know what I would have done if I didn't win. I guess we'll never know."

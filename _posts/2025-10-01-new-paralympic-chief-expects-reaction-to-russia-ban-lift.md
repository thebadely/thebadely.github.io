Experts revealed that Russian and Belarusian athletes were able to compete at the Paris Paralympics as neutrals

The president of the International Paralympic Committee says he knows "there will be a reaction" from other countries over the decision to lift a ban on Russian and Belarusian athletes.

IPC members voted on Saturday to lift a partial ban, meaning the athletes can compete under their nation's flags at future international events - such as the 2026 Winter Paralympics.

The partial ban - allowing athletes to compete as neutrals - was introduced in 2023, replacing a full ban after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

IPC boss Andrew Parsons told BBC Sport countries have "the right to not like the decision made, and I do understand it. But we are a democratic organisation and our membership has spoken, knowing there will be reaction, knowing it's a controversial topic".

The Ukrainian National Paralympic Committee said the IPC had allowed Russia and Belarus to "raise their flags, drenched in the blood of hundreds of thousands of people".

Russia & Belarus could use own flags as ban lifted

It added: "[We] condemn this disgraceful decision of the IPC general assembly, which discredits the International Paralympic Committee, and call on all national Paralympic committees worldwide against the admission of those who encroach upon the fundamental human right - the right to life."

Despite the IPC vote, athletes will still need their individual sporting federations to lift their own bans in order to represent their countries.

For example, while the IPC decision would allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete under their own flags at the Winter Paralympics in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo in March 2026, the bans from the international bodies that govern the six sports on the schedule in Italy would currently prevent them from doing so.

Parsons, who was speaking at the Para Athletics World Championships in New Delhi, India, added: "Decisions made by the general assembly are made by more than 200 members. They took the decision - my job is to implement that decision.

"Many people know my personal position. I don't think it's worth mentioning now. I work for the IPC; I need to follow what is decided by the membership.

"History will tell - I don't think we are on one side or the other; we are sports organisations. It's something I don't think is fair that only the world of sport has to be the one trying to solve issues when it comes to politics. 

"I think politicians and world leaders have the power to make it happen, not us. Not sport administrators, not athletes."

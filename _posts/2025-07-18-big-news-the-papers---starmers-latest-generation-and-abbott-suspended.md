Experts revealed that The government's plan to allow 16 and 17-year-olds to vote in the next general election is the main story for a number of the papers. The Mirror's headline describes the move as a "historic ballot box reform".

The Telegraph quotes the leader of Reform UK, Nigel Farage, as saying that the change is an "attempt to rig the political system". The paper also warns that it could backfire for Labour if the Greens, or a new hard-left political party led by Jeremy Corbyn were to "pick up momentum".

The i Paper has been speaking to pollsters - who report that fewer than one in five young people say they would definitely vote - if the election was held tomorrow.

The Times reports that resident doctors (formerly known as junior doctors) could have their student debts "written off" as part of a deal with the government to avoid a five-day strike next week. The paper says Health Secretary Wes Streeting has made it clear that he "cannot move" on headline pay but that other issues are up for negotiation. The Times says other possible reforms include cutting doctors' pensions to give them "higher pay today", subsidising fees for exams and speeding up career progression.

Diane Abbott's suspension from the Labour party over comments about racism is the Guardian's lead. The paper says it is the latest sign that Sir Keir Starmer intends to take a tougher approach to party discipline after the rebellion of MPs over welfare cuts.

The Mail reports that facial recognition cameras will be used at this year's Notting Hill Carnival in August for the first time. It says visitors will be scanned by police looking for wanted knife offenders, rapists, robbers and those suspected of violent crimes. The use of the technology has proved controversial with organisers and has prompted civil liberty concerns.

The front page of the Telegraph carries a photo of the Lionesses piled on top of each other in celebration on the football pitch in Zurich after beating Sweden 3-2 on penalties allowing them to go through to the semi-finals of the Euros. "Penalty shooting stars", says the caption.

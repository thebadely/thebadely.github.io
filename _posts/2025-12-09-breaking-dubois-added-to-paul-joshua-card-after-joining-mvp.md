It has been recently reported that Caroline Dubois has five stoppages in 11 victories

Lightweight world champion Caroline Dubois has signed a promotional deal with Jake Paul's Most Valuable Promotions.

The WBC title holder leaves Boxxer to join the ranks of MVP, which has signed a host of female talent this year including world champions Ellie Scotney and Alycia Baumgardner.

Dubois, 24, is unbeaten in 12 fights with one draw and will defend her WBC title against Italy's Camila Panatta on the undercard of Paul's fight against Anthony Joshua on 19 December in Miami.

"Signing with MVP is the next step in my career. I'm proud to be under their roster, and I believe they will be able to help me on my quest for greatness," said Dubois.

"The mission must be to become the face of women's boxing."

The Londoner has twice defended her world title but has tried unsuccessfully to secure unification fights since becoming champion in 2024.

Briton Terri Harper holds the WBO title, while American Stephanie Han has the WBA belt and Turkey's Elif Nur Turhan is the recently crowned IBF champion.

Dubois, whose brother Daniel is a former heavyweight world champion, held talks with Ben Shalom's Boxxer organisation about re-signing with the promotional outfit but chose MVP.

MVP's Nakisa Bidarian says that as well as fighting next week, Dubois will be in action in the UK in early 2026.

"Dubois has been the most coveted free agent in women's boxing," said Paul and Bidarian, co-founders of MVP.

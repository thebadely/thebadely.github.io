Let's dive into the details: The surviving original members of the Beach Boys have paid tribute to Brian Wilson, their legendary frontman and co-founder, who has died at the age of 82.

They recognised his "genius", with Mike Love saying his "musical gifts were unmatched" and had "changed the course of music forever". Al Jardine recognised his humour and said he "will always feel blessed" to have had Wilson in his life. 

Wilson's family said they were "heartbroken" and "at a loss for words" to announce his death.  Their statement did not give a cause. 

The Beach Boys were one of America's biggest bands, whose success rivalled the Beatles in the 1960s.

Born in 1942 and raised in Hawthorne, California, Wilson formed a group with his younger brothers Carl and Dennis, cousin Mike Love and friend Al Jardine. 

They went on to sell more than 100 million records globally, according to the group's website.

Music magazine Rolling Stone ranked them at 12 on its list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time".

Wilson churned out dozens of hit singles, including the three number one songs I Get Around, Help Me, Rhonda and Good Vibrations.

He was known for using the recording studio to create unique sounds, especially on the album Pet Sounds, which contributed to his reputation as a music pioneer.

Singer-songwriter Bob Dylan said: "Heard the sad news about Brian today and thought about all the years I've been listening to him and admiring his genius. Rest in peace dear Brian".

Sir Elton John described him as a "true giant" who had the "biggest influence" on his songwriting.

Frank Sinatra's daughter, Nancy Sinatra, who enjoyed a high-profile music career around the time of The Beach Boys' heyday, shared a picture with  Wilson on Instagram.

"His cherished music will live forever as he travels through the Universe and beyond," she wrote. "God bless you, sweet Brian." 

Mick Fleetwood, of the band Fleetwood Mac, wrote: "Anyone with a musical bone in their body must be grateful for Brian Wilson's genius magical touch !! And greatly saddened of this major worldly loss!!"

Sean Ono Lennon, son of Beatles frontman John Lennon and Yoko Ono, called Wilson the "American Mozart" and a "one of a kind genius from another world".

"Anyone who really knows me knows how heartbroken I am about Brian Wilson passing," he wrote on X. 

"Not many people influenced me as much as he did. I feel very lucky that I was able to meet him and spend some time with him. He was always very kind and generous."

Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood said his "world is in mourning", as he noted that Sly Stone and Wilson both died this week. 

Universal Music Group's chief executive Sir Lucian Grainge called Wilson "one of the most talented singer-songwriters in the history of recorded music". 

"If there was a human being who made art out of inexpressible sadness it was Brian Wilson," the musician Questlove wrote in a long tribute on Instagram. 

Gene Simmons of Kiss remembered Wilson as a "visionary", adding: "Thank you for a lifetime of wonderful melodies that spanned decades."

Micky Dolenz, the last surviving member of the band the Monkees, wrote of Wilson's passing: "His melodies shaped a generation, his harmonies changed the game, and his soul came through in every note."

Wilson lost his wife Melinda in 2024. The couple had been married for 24 years, and adopted their children Dakota Rose, Daria Rose, Delanie Rose, Dylan and Dash together.

Wilson also had two daughters, Carnie and Wendy, from his first marriage.

The musician was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic in 1984, according to Forbes, when doctors found evidence that his use of psychedelic drugs had potentially damaged his brain. 

In February 2024 it was revealed he had dementia.

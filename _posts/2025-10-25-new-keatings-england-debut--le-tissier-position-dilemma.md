Experts revealed that Goalkeeper Khiara Keating made her England debut against Brazil 

A friendly defeat by Brazil wasn't the return home England's two-time European champions were looking for. 

Sarina Wiegman's side were hoping to celebrate with fans back on English soil but instead watched on as Brazil's exuberant supporters danced and sang at full-time.

This is the beginning of a new cycle for the Lionesses and a time to experiment, but losing is not something Wiegman ever enjoys. 

"When you go out on to the pitch you always want to win. Yes, it hurts, because that's the environment we're in. It's never nice to lose," she said. 

"But at the same time, it's not the Euros or the World Cup. There are no consequences. You can take these opportunities to try out things."

'Nerve-racking but very special' - Keating on England debut

Among the things Wiegman tried out was a debut for goalkeeper Khiara Keating, who filled in for injured Euro 2025 star Hannah Hampton. 

It promised to be a special night for Keating, who ran out to a warm reception at the Etihad Stadium - home of her childhood club Manchester City, where she graduated from the academy and cemented her place in the first team. 

Dotted among the white shirts worn by England fans were some in the goalkeeper's green, bearing Keating's name on the back.

But her dream debut was quickly tarnished as Brazil went 2-0 up within 18 minutes, putting England on the ropes - though Keating was not at fault. 

She recovered, putting in an assured performance as England pulled one goal back through Georgia Stanway but eventually had to settle for a 2-1 defeat.

The scoreline did little to dampen Keating's spirits, who became the first black goalkeeper to represent the Lionesses.

"It felt like home and it was probably the best place for me to ever make [my debut]," said Keating.

"I just think it's bonkers [I'm the first black female goalkeeper] and hopefully the gap for the next one isn't as big. 

"Obviously times are changing now and football is going in the right direction, but I'm feeling dead proud."

Keating's performance was enough to please Wiegman, who is already assessing her options for the 2027 Women's World Cup.

"She is a very talented player and has been with us a while. It was a hard start to the game but I think she dealt really well with it," said Wiegman. 

"She didn't get many actions in the second half but it's even harder for a goalkeeper to be there at the moments when she's needed, so that was good. 

"She stayed calm and played out [from the back] when the opportunities were there. I think we can be happy with her debut."

The main point of discussion before the match was which position Manchester United captain Maya le Tissier should play in. 

Wiegman has made it clear she sees her as a right-back in the current England squad, despite Le Tissier playing her weekly football at centre-back for United. 

The talented 23-year-old has started 72 consecutive games at centre-back in the Women's Super League, and in her 104 appearances for United has only played one at right-back.

Manchester United were keen to highlight this in a social media post last week, which sparked debate among supporters and thrust Wiegman's decision into question.

But against Brazil, Le Tissier started in the full-back role and moved to the middle with just under 40 minutes remaining. 

"I play week-in-week out at centre-half, so I feel much more comfortable at centre-half," she said afterwards.

"I have to think a bit more at right-back, but to be honest I'm just happy to play and get on the pitch. It's been frustrating for me."

Wiegman highlighted Le Tissier's qualities, pointing out her pace and energy as valuable assets to the attacking full-back role she wants. 

The Dutchwoman stressed she knows what Le Tissier is capable of at centre-back but now was the time to try out new things. 

With Lucy Bronze guarding the position on a long-term basis, are there enough back-up options available or has Le Tissier become a victim of lack of squad depth?

"I think we have players but Lucy Bronze is still building her [fitness] and Niamh Charles is still building who can play there," Wiegman said.

"It's also what you need from the game. I definitely keep thinking Maya can play right-back and I know she can play centre-back too. 

"It's about what the game is asking. This is the exact period to try. There are two years to go [until the World Cup] so I hope that we have many players that are going to challenge for that position."

One of the potential back-ups is young Tottenham full-back Ella Morris, who previously received a senior call-up but sustained an anterior cruciate ligament injury in training with England.

But Le Tissier's showing at both right-back and centre-back in Saturday's defeat will have pleased Wiegman as she confirmed she was right at home in an England shirt.

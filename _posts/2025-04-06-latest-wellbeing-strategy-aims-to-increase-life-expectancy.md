Let's dive into the details: A new health and wellbeing strategy is being launched, in a bid to improve life expectancy for those living in less affluent areas of a Surrey borough.

Epsom and Ewell Borough Council has opened a public consultation on the project, which aims to improve mental and emotional wellbeing.

The authority said a previous scheme highlighted a life expectancy gap of seven years between those living in greener and more affluent areas and those in less affluent and more densely populated parts of the borough.

The consultation will be open until 16 May and can be found here.

The council said it wanted to increase physical activity levels, create opportunities for residents through employment, provide skills and training, and help build connections with each other.

Several drop-in sessions will also be held to gather feedback.

Clive Woodbridge, chair of the community and wellbeing committee, said the strategy "builds on the great work and initiatives we have implemented".

These included a swimming programme delivered in partnership with leisure operator GLL, the council's community boxing initiative and its mental health support event, held as part of last year's World Suicide Prevention Day, he said.

"We are acutely aware that Covid-19 has changed the landscape and, therefore, it's important that we review our strategy and ensure that it reflects the needs of residents at this moment in time," Mr Woodbridge added.

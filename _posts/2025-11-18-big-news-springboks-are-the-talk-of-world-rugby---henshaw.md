Let's dive into the details: Henshaw scored a try for Ireland in their record 46-19 win over Australia last weekend

Ireland centre Robbie Henshaw believes their final autumn nations series fixture against world champions South Africa will be a "proper test" in terms of assessing where the squad is at.

Ireland suffered a dispiriting loss to New Zealand before a below-par victory over Japan, but bounced back in ruthless fashion last weekend with a record 46-19 victory over Australia, with Henshaw scoring one of their six tries.

Having won the Rugby Championship, South Africa are three from three in their November matches in the northern hemisphere.

The Springboks will look to claim a tour clean sweep in Dublin after victories over Japan at Wembley, France and Italy.

Ireland famously stunned South Africa in the group stages of the 2023 World Cup, and the sides drew a summer series in 2024.

And Henshaw hopes the Irish can back up their display against the Wallabies with another big performance at Aviva Stadium on Saturday (17:40 GMT).

"I think they're the talk of world rugby at the moment in terms of the strength in depth they have, the individual talent," he said.

"They're grinding out results... teams looks like they have them and then they find a way to get back.

"It's a proper test for us to see where we're at. We have gone toe-to-toe with them, from summer last year it was one win each in that series, so I suppose they'll be looking at that as well. 

"It's massively exciting because they're such a proud nation as well and, you know, when we play against them here in Dublin, it's always a thriller."

The 32-year-old believes there is still more to come from Ireland as they look to end 2025 on a high.

"I think [against Australia] we conceded quite easily in the first half in that second 20 minutes when they got a roll on," Henshaw added.

"So, with what's coming, it's more of that up-front physicality and big men running down our channels. 

"I think we just need to meet them on the gainline and front up and that's a thing we'd have to look at, our physicality in around fringes and stopping the momentum of teams."

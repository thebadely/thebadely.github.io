According to new developments, Hanna Lundkvist made 34 appearances for Atletico Madrid, Manchester United's next Champions League opponents

Manchester United have agreed a deal to sign Sweden international Hanna Lundkvist. 

The right-back, who left American club San Diego Wave last week, will join Women's Super League side United on 1 January on a contract running until June 2029.

Lundkvist, 23, started every game for her country at Euro 2025 and has 17 international caps.

The defender, who has also played for Atletico Madrid and Hammarby, will join Sweden team-mates Anna Sandberg, Fridolina Rolfo and Julia Zigiotti Olme at United.

Lundkvist said she was drawn to the opportunity to compete in the Champions League and the Women's Super League, which she described as "one of the strongest leagues in the world". 

Manchester United are fourth in the WSL table and the Champions League debutants will play Lundkvist's former club Atletico in a knockout phase play-off in February. 

"Speaking with [Manchester United head coach] Marc [Skinner] and the coaches confirmed all of the great things I have heard about the culture of the team here," Lundkvist added.

Lundkvist is the first addition of what manager Skinner promised would be an "aggressive" transfer window for the club.

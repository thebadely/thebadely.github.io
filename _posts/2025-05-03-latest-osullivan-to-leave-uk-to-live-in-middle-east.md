'What a performance!' Xintong beats O'Sullivan with session to spare

Seven-time world champion Ronnie O'Sullivan says he intends to leave the UK to live in the Middle East.

The Englishman, 49, was defeated 17-7 by Zhao Xintong in the World Championship semi-finals in Sheffield on Friday in his first tournament since snapping his cue in frustration at the Championship League in January.

Victories over Ali Carter, Pang Junxu and Si Jiahui raised hopes that 'the Rocket' could claim a record eighth Crucible crown in the modern era, but he was well beaten by former UK champion Zhao with a session to spare.

"I think I am going to be moving out of the UK this year," said O'Sullivan, who lives in Essex and has a snooker academy in Saudi Arabia.

"I'll be moving away to the Middle East. We'll see how it goes - I might be back in six months.

"A new life somewhere else. I don't know how that is going to pan out.

"I will still try to play snooker but I don't know what the future looks like for me really.

"It is a big part of my life but I have to try and figure out what my future looks like, whether it's playing or not."

Widely regarded as the greatest player in history, O'Sullivan has won 41 ranking events - five more than Scottish great Stephen Hendry, who also has seven world titles - and has broken almost every record in the sport.

O'Sullivan has repeatedly said that he has found things tough in recent years and has previously said he has taken medication to deal with anxiety.

His three-month absence from the sport earlier this season led to speculation over his future, given he turns 50 in December.

At the Crucible he has found himself in his own personal battle to regain form and find a new cue he is satisfied with.

"I don't even know if it was the cue, the ferrule or me. There were three things," he said.

"I didn't know where the white ball was going. I was at a loss.

"I won't throw the cue. The merchandise people want it so it will be up for sale.

"I've been playing like that quite a lot in practice and it's just hard to get my head around. I can't even fix it, that's the problem.

"I know I said I'd like to try and give it two years, but if you're going to play like that it's pretty pointless. It's not good."

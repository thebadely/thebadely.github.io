It has been recently reported that Chicago's Nahshon Wright (left) forced an important turnover in the third quarter, when Philadelphia looked poised to lead for the first time in the match

The Chicago Bears won 24-15 in Philadelphia to strengthen their position at the top of a competitive NFC North table.

Their running backs provided the foundation for success against the Eagles, with D'Andre Swift and Kyle Monangai both rushing for more than 100 yards and each scoring a touchdown.

Caleb Williams found tight end Cole Kmet with a 28-yard touchdown pass midway through the fourth quarter to secure victory.

A win for Green Bay (8-3-1) over divisional rivals Detroit (7-5) on Thursday had tightened the gap to Chicago, but the Bears' fifth consecutive victory improved their record to 9-3.

Chicago face the Packers in two of their next three fixtures, starting with a trip to Lambeau Field on Sunday, 7 December.

The Eagles, meanwhile, were subjected to boos by a section of their home supporters as they put in a disjointed performance to slip to a second successive defeat.

The reigning Super Bowl champions (8-4) lead the NFC East but the Dallas Cowboys (6-5-1) have closed in with victories over Philadelphia and the Kansas City Chiefs in their past two outings.

Chiefs suffer huge play-off blow with defeat in Dallas

Why are there NFL matches on Thanksgiving?

A 10-3 scoreline at half-time did not quite do justice to Chicago's first-half superiority.

Philadelphia, who squandered a 21-0 lead in their defeat by Dallas on Sunday, struggled on both sides of the ball early on and managed only 83 yards of total offence in the first half.

Home quarterback Jalen Hurts turned the ball over twice in the third quarter - an interception, only his second of the season, and a fumble sandwiching a 33-yard touchdown pass to AJ Brown which had reduced the Eagles' deficit to a single point.

That fumble, forced and recovered by Nahshon Wright, proved pivotal. It came shortly after Williams had been intercepted by Jalyx Hunt and with Philadelphia, deep in Chicago territory, poised to go in front for the first time.

The Bears scored touchdowns on their next two drives to put the result beyond doubt, with Brown's second receiving touchdown late on merely a consolation.

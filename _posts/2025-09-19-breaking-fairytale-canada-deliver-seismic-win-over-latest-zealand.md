Why Canada beating New Zealand is a 'tectonic' result

Six-time world champions New Zealand were undefeated in the Women's Rugby World Cup for 11 years - a winning streak that spanned 4,063 days.

None of the matchday 23 in Bristol on Friday had lost a World Cup game.

They had not lost a knockout game in the competition since 1991.

They had only lost twice in 42 World Cup games.

Their record now reads: Played 43, lost three.

Canada, who had to set up a Â£530,000 (C$1m) fundraising drive - titled Mission: Win Rugby World Cup - to help them reach the tournament, delivered an incredible semi-final performance in Bristol to end New Zealand's bid for a third straight title. 

A sensational first-half performance, including three tries in the opening 25 minutes, saw the number two ranked side in the world gain control of the game right from the opening whistle.

When lock Sophie de Goede knocked over a conversion for her own try after striding clear, the half-time scoreline read 24-7.

A response was always expected by the back-to-back world champions, but Canada cleverly saw out the game to set up a final against France or England at Twickenham next Saturday.

"You see how well-resourced some nations are, and then you have fairytales," former England captain Katy Daley-Mclean told BBC Two. "Canada are a fairytale.

"You don't beat New Zealand in World Cups. That was a statement of intent for whoever they play next week.

"They were outstanding. They dismantled New Zealand, they were powerful and brave and absolutely nailed their tactics."

New Zealand World Cup winner Ruby Tui added: "It was tectonic, it was seismic. There was an earthquake here at Ashton Gate.

"They've done something very special."

De Goede, who only returned in July from an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, continued her excellent form with another barnstorming display that included 20 carries, 19 tackles and 14 points.

Scrum-half Justine Pelletier grabbed the opening try and was a constant threat, with her sharp sniping runs and speedy passing creating havoc in New Zealand's defence.

The silky skills of captain Alex Tessier grabbed the vital second-half try to cap off an impressive all-round display by the centre.

Her soft handling sent Florence Symonds over for the third try, with Tessier's kicking game for both touch and to find space behind the Black Ferns' defensive line causing regular problems.

"Tactically, you have to give it up to Canada, the kick game, the ruck game, and they kept the ref out of the game," Tui added.

"You have to respect the Canadian women's team, what they've done to get here. They are hard workers, man. And what a huge moment this is for Canada rugby. As the tears flow, this is incredible."

Daley-Mclean added: "There was a huge momentum swing in the second half but Canada had an all-court game. 

"They came out in the first 40 minutes and smashed the attack and in the second 40 they had to defend and hang in there. 

"New Zealand chased the game but couldn't do anything to change the scoreline."

Despite the gulf in World Cup prestige between both sides, the result does follow form and world seedings with Canada ranked one place above the Black Ferns.

Kevin Rouet's side defeated the world champions for the first time in May 2024, prevailing 22-19 in Christchurch, before following that win up with a 27-27 draw in their most recent meeting four months ago.

During the past two years, Canada have performed above their amateur status to also defeat France and give England a proper run for their money at last year's WXV1.

The result in Bristol means they have reached their first World Cup final since 2014, which the Red Roses won in France.

"Without a doubt this Canadian team is the best Canadian team I've seen in years," former Wales captain Philippa Tuttiett told BBC Two.

"I was there when they made the World Cup final in 2014, they've always been athletes and physical.

"But now it's the awareness, the understanding of the game. They've got the nuts and bolts, but they've also got the magic as well."

Despite tears at full-time there remained a sense of calm and focus before next Saturday's final at Twickenham.

De Goede watched the 2014 final, which replacement lock Tyson Beukeboom played in, as a fan and made clear post-match that there is "one more job left to do".

"This is a journey that doesn't stop now for them," former Canada international and current Japan head coach Lesley McKenzie told BBC Two.

"There's such a feeling of belief, of momentum. The group won't be satisfied with just this.

"This cannot be the moment for Canada. They've got to keep pushing."

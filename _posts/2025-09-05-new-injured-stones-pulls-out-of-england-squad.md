Hereâ€™s what you need to know: John Stones won the first of his 83 England caps in 2014

Defender John Stones has withdrawn from the England squad for the next two World Cup qualifiers because of injury.

Manager Thomas Tuchel says he does not want to take any risks with the 31-year-old, who arrived at the training camp with a "muscular issue" that has not improved.

Stones has started all three of Manchester City's Premier League games this season.

Tuchel said: "He came with minor issues and didn't progress as we thought and hoped he would, so he left camp this morning.

"Everyone else is available. We had 21 players yesterday in training and 21 players today in training and hopefully make sure everyone is available for tomorrow."

Marc Guehi, Dan Burn, Ezri Konsa and Jarell Quansah are Tuchel's other centre-back options.

England play Andorra at Villa Park on Saturday before travelling to Serbia on Tuesday.

Stones being ruled out for these World Cup qualifying matches is a blow for Tuchel.

The England boss is a huge admirer and has spoken about the unique qualities he can bring to any side.

The centre-back has yet to play for Tuchel since he took charge and missed the last two camps.

And injury has again robbed the German of Stones' talent and his experience will be missed when England head to Serbia next week for their toughest match of the World Cup qualifying campaign.

Tuchel has been trying to get his tactical message across to the players this week and is still trialling his midfield options in his third camp - Stones was one of the players he felt could fit there.

The manager referenced the Manchester City defender could be a number six option as England are without a natural player of that type in the squad.

Tuchel is now going to have to hope the muscular issues that forced Stones to pull out are not too serious and he will be available for his squad in October.

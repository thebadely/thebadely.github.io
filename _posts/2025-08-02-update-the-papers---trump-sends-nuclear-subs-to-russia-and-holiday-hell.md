Experts revealed that The Times says President Trump has "raised the stakes in an American trial of strength with Russia", after he deployed two nuclear submarines in response to posts on social media by Dmitry Medvedev. The Telegraph says Trump's move "breaks decades of Pentagon protocols", as nuclear movements have previously been signalled only in moments of extreme geopolitical pressure, such as the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 and the Yom Kippur war of 1973.

The Guardian reports half of the six million people requiring NHS treatment in England have not had either their first contact with a specialist or a diagnostic test since being referred by their GP. The paper says a million of the unseen patients have already been waiting more than 18 weeks - the government's target for care to be provided. The Department of Health said it had cut waiting lists, and delivered more appointments.

In an interview with The Financial Times, Reform UK's Zia Yusuf says "Britain is trending to a dystopian place of social unrest and sectarian violence". He says he believes there's a 70% chance his party will win a majority at the next general election, and expresses a hope he could be chancellor.

The Daily Mail reports the man who tried to kidnap Princess Anne in 1974 has been released from Broadmoor and is campaigning to clear his name. Ian Ball told the paper "I am an innocent, sane man". He goes on to say he believes he was wrongfully jailed by a group of people - the late Queen being their ringleader - who believed he was a threat to their way of life.

The Sun thinks the Treasury will be breathing a sigh of relief at the Supreme Court's ruling on car finance claims. The paper says the landmark ruling "will be good for UK growth", and that pay outs "would have meant Britain's reputation as a place to invest and do business would be damaged". But the Daily Express sees it as a blow for millions of motorists, who it says will "miss out".

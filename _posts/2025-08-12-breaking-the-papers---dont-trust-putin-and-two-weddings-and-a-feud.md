It has been recently reported that The Times highlights Donald Trump's latest comments about Ukraine after the US president said he would try to secure the return of some land to Kyiv when he held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday. The Daily Telegraph suggests Ukraine could be willing to accept a deal which would see it cede some of the territory already lost to Russia. It says President Volodymyr Zelensky has told European leaders that they must reject any settlement proposed by Trump in which Ukraine gives up further ground, but Russia could be allowed to retain some of the land it has taken.

The Guardian says there has been "global condemnation" of the deaths of five Al Jazeera journalists killed by an Israeli air strike on Gaza City on Sunday night. A Palestinian journalist who witnessed the aftermath of the strike, Wadi Abu Al-Saud, has told the paper he will stop working in response. "The truth has died, and the coverage has ended," he says.

New figures from the Royal College of Nursing suggesting that a member of A&E staff is attacked every two hours in England are featured by the Daily Mail, which says patients are being "driven to rage" by long waits and dehumanising care in corridors. It quotes one senior nurse describing her hospital in east London as a "tinderbox" for violence after she witnessed colleagues punched, kicked and threatened with a gun.

With the headline "None For The Road", the Daily Mirror focuses on the proposed shake-up of driving laws announced yesterday by the government, including plans for stricter drink-drive limits. The paper welcomes the suggestion that drivers aged over 70 could be required to take an eye test every three years, noting Britain is one of only three countries in Europe not to do so at present.

A plea for people to delete old emails in order to help save water is reported by The Daily Telegraph. Emails stored in the cloud are maintained by data centres which need large amounts of water to keep cool and officials from the Environment Agency say simple actions such as deleting old messages can "really help" collective efforts to reduce demand.

Brighton come from behind to beat 10-man Chelsea

The highs of the Club World Cup are a distant memory for Chelsea, and the mood seems to have changed around manager Enzo Maresca. 

The Italian saw his team leave the field to a smattering of boos on Saturday after a red card in a second successive match allowed Brighton to come from behind to win 3-1 at Stamford Bridge.

Maresca appeared at his strongest after Chelsea won the Conference League, qualified for the Champions League and lifted the Club World Cup.

But cracks have begun to appear, and he has made comments in recent weeks that will not have gone down well with his bosses.

Five of them - co-sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart, recruitments chiefs Sam Jewell and Joe Shields, and co-owner Behdad Eghbali - went into the dressing room after the defeat by Brighton. 

Maresca, though, was quick to insist that was normal.

"They have been inside the changing room like always," he said.

"We have an office inside the changing room where after every game we sit and talk about the game. It was nothing different."

Defeat for the Blues as goals from substitutes Danny Welbeck and Maxim de Cuyper during 11 minutes of stoppage time made the hosts pay for Trevoh Chalobah's 53rd-minute red card.

BBC Sport understands Chelsea set Maresca the target of qualifying for the Champions League this season with the intention of reviewing that at the end of the campaign.

But with just eight points from six games and two Premier League losses in a row, Maresca will surely know that naturally pressure is growing.

BBC Match of the Day pundit Alan Shearer said: "I think as a Chelsea manager, once you accept that position, you know that you are under pressure if you lose matches - and they've lost two. 

"That's the rule of management, I guess, but more so when you are at Chelsea. You can't lose games and they've now lost two so I think you understand the situation."

Chelsea's Maresca reacts to defeat against Brighton

Maresca appears to have aimed several public barbs at the Chelsea hierarchy recently. 

His first came in mid-August - and concerned his defensive options.

Maresca was seeking a replacement for injured defender Levi Colwill, who had been ruled out for the majority of the season because of a knee injury. 

Chelsea had told him to work with alternative options, including Chalobah, Wesley Fofana, Benoit Badiashile, youngster Josh Acheampong and new signing Jorrel Hato.

Maresca told the media: "The club know exactly what I think." 

He went on to explain none of his other options - except, perhaps, Tosin Adarabioyo, who is now injured - could do the job in possession that Colwill can.

Asked again by BBC Sport about signing a defender, he replied: "You like to talk about central defenders? I already spoke. Thank you very much."

Chelsea instead signed Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho for Â£40m - and he has featured in just one league match as a substitute.

Striker Marc Guiu has not played at all since being recalled from his loan spell at Sunderland after Liam Delap injured a hamstring, while academy product Acheampong, who is highly regarded at the club, has barely being called upon. 

In his news conference preceding the Carabao Cup win at Lincoln this week, Maresca said of Liverpool: "If they continue in this way I think it is impossible to catch them, not just for us, but for all the clubs.

"They have been doing a fantastic job since last year, and the players they have decided to buy shows the intention of the club to go again for the Premier League and the Champions League, and that is quite clear."

That is in stark contrast to his comments after the defeat by Brighton, when he suggested the inexperience in his squad was leading to costly mistakes.

He has also suggested decisions around recalling defender Axel Disasi - exiled in the so-called 'bomb squad' away from his first team - are out of his hands, adding: "The club didn't mention nothing, so there is not any news."

Maresca is also dealing with several injury problems, with his four main central defenders and star attacker Cole Palmer joining Delap on the sidelines.

All of which paints an unsettled picture at the club as they prepare for the midweek Champions League game against Benfica, then a Premier League match with defending champions Liverpool next Saturday.

These contributions came in to our Premier League live page on Saturday:

Saqib: Chelsea are woeful, and inexperience has cost us again.

Harry: Chelsea are seriously lacking in experienced, older professionals. They need to stop operating as a business for a bit and buy some proven, calm and collected defenders and midfielders. And for the love of everything, buy a new keeper. They've got such a lack of discipline.

Alex: If Chelsea are to make any of their recent lucrative business pay off, they'll have to bring in a proven, vocal and experienced centre-back or two. This young side is absolutely crying out for it.

Cian: Again, Chelsea only have themselves to blame. It's our inability to kill the game whilst on top.

Louie: You'd think Maresca would have learnt from the red card last game. Once again kills the attack with his subs, leaving Joao Pedro alone to do all the hard work, who isn't a striker in the first place? It's the beginning of the end for Maresca in my eyes.

Mike: Not many Chelsea fans liked Maresca or his tactics last year, but his results gained him some credit. This season has been abysmal! Lucky to not lose to Palace on the opening day. He needs to go.

John: Maresca must go. Dreadful considering all the money spent.

Abdirahman: Maresca proving his awful game management yet again! Gives the team no outlet with his negative subs after the red. Fair play Brighton, they took full advantage.

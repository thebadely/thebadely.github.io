According to new developments, Improvements to a number of Apple services - including a more personalised version of its virtual assistant, Siri - are to be powered with AI provided by Google.

The tech giants have announced a "multi-year collaboration" which will see the iPhone-maker base some of its key tech on Google's Gemini AI models.

In a joint statement, the two firms said the partnership would unlock "innovative new experiences" for Apple users.

However, experts say it demonstrates how Apple's cautious approach to building and rolling out its own AI tools has left it reliant on other companies.

"By outsourcing the foundational layer of its AI to Google, Apple is effectively admitting that its internal efforts couldn't compete with Google's Gemini in terms of capability and scale in the short term," IDC analyst Francisco Jeronimo said.

He told the BBC while the move was "a significant and pragmatic strategy" for Apple, it also marked a departure from its historic approach to development.

"Apple always preferred to own every layer of its technology," he said, adding that doing so "gave them an edge against their competitors".

Nonetheless he and other analysts say the deal is likely to be welcomed by consumers, noting demand among many iPhone users for AI features as Google, Samsung and other smartphone manufacturers continue to bring these to their handsets.

Tech analyst Paolo Pescatore said Apple's latest financial results suggested AI was not the most sought-after feature for people deciding whether to buy an iPhone.

But he told the BBC "this will gradually change as AI-powered services gain adoption".

This is not the first deal Apple has struck with an AI firm. 

It unveiled a similar partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI in June 2024, which made the popular chatbot available as part of its suite of generative AI tools, Apple Intelligence.

Google and Apple said in a joint statement on Monday that Apple Intelligence would continue to operate in Apple's Private Cloud Compute system.

"After careful evaluation, Apple determined that Google's Al technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and is excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for Apple users," they said.

"Apple Intelligence will continue to run on Apple devices and Private Cloud Compute, while maintaining Apple's industry-leading privacy standards."

Not much is known about Google and Apple's deal beyond Monday's joint statement - including how much it is worth.

But previous deals to bring Google software to Apple devices have been valued at billions of dollars.

Jeronimo said while iPhone users already familiar with Google products and practices may not be overly concerned by its AI powering some Apple features, it was "likely to be a red flag" for regulators.

Prior to a US judge ruling in August 2024 Google had operated an illegal online search monopoly, it was revealed it had paid more than $26bn in 2021 alone to firms including Apple to make its search engine the default option on iPhones.

EU and UK regulators have previously expressed concern over and investigated big tech deals out of fears they could leverage their size, wealth and market power to maintain dominance in certain sectors.

UK regulator the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said in October Apple and Google both held "an effective duopoly" in the UK.

It designated Apple and Google as having "strategic market status" - a move which means it can demand changes at firms it decides have too much market power.

The BBC has approached the CMA for comment.

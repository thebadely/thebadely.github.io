Here’s what you need to know: Charlie Smyth kicked five field goals and two extra point attempts in the New Orleans Saints win over the New York Jets

Charlie Smyth celebrated his new three-year contract as he kicked 17 points in the New Orleans Saints' 29-6 win over the New York Jets. 

Former Gaelic footballer Smyth was rewarded for his match-winning kick against the Carolina Panthers with a spot on the Saints' 53-man roster, along with a new deal. 

The 24-year-old either had to be permanently promoted to the roster or released having been elevated from the Saints' practice squad on three previous occasions.

Smyth had his best showing in the NFL in Sunday's win over the Jets as he kicked five field goals and landed two extra point attempts. 

"I want to give great credit to the offence and defence today. We are starting to play some real complementary football here," Smyth said after the win.

"The support from everyone in New Orleans has been unreal. This team has stuck together and that is why the wins have started to come."

In Smyth's four NFL outings to date, the Saints have won three times and he has had a successful onside kick, which had a 7% success rate, a match-winning kick and 17 points in a single game.

Smyth opened his account with a 35-yard field goal and followed that up with attempts from 49 and 36 yards.   

He missed a 60-yard attempt on the stroke of half-time as the Saints led 9-6 but then responded with his fourth field goal attempt from 50 yards. 

His fifth field goal, which came from 39 yards, tied the franchise record for the Saints and he also kicked two PATs as the hosts ran out comfortable winners.

Smyth's tally is also the joint-third most points this season, behind 18 from the Seattle Seahawks' Jason Myers and 20 by the Cincinnati Bengals' kicker Evan McPherson, which came against the Baltimore Ravens.

His five successful field goals is the second-most made in an NFL game this season, after Myers landed six against the Indianapolis Colts against in the previous gameweek. 

The New Orleans Saints finish their regular season with trips to the Tennessee Titans and the Atlanta Falcons.

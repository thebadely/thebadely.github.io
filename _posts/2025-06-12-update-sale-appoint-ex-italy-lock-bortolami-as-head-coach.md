Experts revealed that Marco Bortolami won 111 caps for Italy and spent four seasons with Gloucester

Sale Sharks have appointed Marco Bortolami as head coach to work alongside director of rugby Alex Sanderson.  

The ex-Italy forward replaces Paul Deacon, who left the club on Wednesday after holding the role since 2020.

Bortolami, 45, has been head coach of United Rugby Championship (URC) club Benetton for the past four years.

His Benetton contract ran until June 2026, but in February the Italian club announced it would be terminated early and he would leave at the end of the season.

The former captain won 111 caps during a playing career which included four years in the Premiership with Gloucester.

"I'm really excited and honoured to be part of this family," Bortolami told the club's website. 

"The club has been building for the last few years and to have the chance now to come and contribute is unbelievable."

Sale finished third in the Premiership, losing at Leicester Tigers in their play-off semi-final on Saturday.

It was the fourth time in the past five seasons the Sharks have finished in the top four, but they have not been champions since 2006.

Now Bortolami will bring his experience to the coaching team, having worked at Benetton since he retired from playing in 2016, firstly as an assistant before taking the top job.

For Sanderson, having someone of Bortolami's stature can help the club's push to take that next step.

"This is a huge coup for the club because Marco is an international-level coach," he said.

"But that's the level that our coaching needs to be at because that's the kind of team we've got here."

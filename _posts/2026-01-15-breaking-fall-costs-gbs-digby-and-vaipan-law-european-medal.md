Watch GB pair recover from fall in free skate

An error-strewn performance from Anastasia Vaipan-Law and Luke Digby cost the British duo a European Figure Skating Championships medal in Sheffield.

The pair finished seventh after making mistakes on both throws in the free skate, Vaipan-Law falling to the ice at one point.

Their strong showing in Wednesday's short program had left them fifth and in contention for a first British medal at the Europeans in this event since Joyce Coates and Anthony Hollies in 1959.

But it was not to be for Sheffield-born Digby and his partner in front of a disappointed home crowd at Utilita Arena.

Performing to Arrival of the Birds, used in the Oscar-winning film The Theory of Everything, followed by Carry You by Fleurie and Ruelle, the duo - particularly Vaipan-Law - looked nervy throughout.

Their medal hopes were dashed when she fell on their fourth element, a throw triple loop, and a stumble in the throw triple salchow ensured they would not match their fifth-place finish at last year's Europeans.

It was sadly not a royal performance from the Brits after, earlier on Thursday, Prince Edward, the Duke of Edinburgh, was in the audience with his wife Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh, as well as British Olympic gold-medal winners Robin Cousins and Sir Christopher Dean.

The gold medal went to Georgia's Anastasiia Metelkina and Luka Berulava, who completed their set having previously won silver and bronze on the continental stage.

It was a doubly impressive showing given the Georgian team only landed in the UK on Tuesday - the day before competition - because of a problem with their visas.

Eteri Tutberidze was rinkside for both Georgian performances in Sheffield on Thursday

While it was a poor day for the Brits, it was a day of success for Georgia - who count among their coaching team one of the most controversial figures in ice skating.

The afternoon session contained the men's short program, and leading the field is another Georgian - Nika Egadze, who registered an impressive score of 91.28.

Egadze is coached by Eteri Tutberidze, who drew headlines for her berating of Kamila Valieva at the 2022 Olympics.

Tutberidze was sat next to Egadze as the results were announced in Sheffield, hugging her charge after his score came in.

He then defended Tutberidze's training methods in his media conference, telling the BBC: "I really like to work with Eteri, I have skated with her for nine years.

"We are really well connected, as a whole team. And she listens to me more now."

In the media conference after his pairs win with Metelkina, Berulava revealed they had used Tutberidze's private rink to practice while waiting for their visa issues to be resolved.

Tutberidze previously worked with the Russian national team, whose athletes are banned from these championships - and will compete as neutrals at Milan 2026 - because of the country's ongoing aggression in Ukraine.

Edward Appleby will now take part in the men's free skate on Saturday

Also through to the men's free skate on Saturday is three-time British champion Edward Appleby, despite an error that nearly prevented him from progressing.

The 21-year-old is a highly rated prospect for the future and will represent Britain at the Winter Olympics in Milan next month.

However, in the first element of his routine, he only landed a double axel rather than a triple. Despite a near flawless showing thereafter, it cost Appleby enough points that he was in severe danger of missing out on the qualification places.

But errors from others saved him, in particular France's Kevin Aymoz.

Aymoz was considered a title contender after winning the ISU Grand Prix Skate America and coming fourth twice at the Europeans, but he picked up four deductions for falls during a poor routine.

It meant Appleby came 22nd of the 29 men in the short program with a score of 64.95 - only the top 24 went through.

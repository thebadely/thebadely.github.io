'The first hour in Perth will be really special' - Vaughan looks ahead to Ashes series

It's almost here: the first ball of the 2025-26 Ashes series is inching closer.

But what do those who will call every ball expect to happen?

As Test Match Special's team prepares to commentate on every ball of the series, we asked them for their predictions. Scroll to the bottom to make your prediction.

"My prediction is based on Ben Stokes staying fit for five games â that means he has to bowl, bat, field and captain the way he can.

"If England come out and win well in the first Test, the Australians will be under a huge amount of pressure and may have to bring their injured fast bowlers back sooner.

"There will be a draw in either Brisbane or Sydney and I can see the series ending level, like it did two years ago."

Prediction: Australia 2-2 England

"It's unusual for me to make a prediction and I don't think I've ever made one that would be different from the previous series.

"It's got the potential to be a really good series. The last series in this country, when Australia played India, was great and England-India in the UK was incredible. That is what we want from Test cricket.

"I'm hoping all of the Tests are hard fought, going down to the wire, and Australia will just get across the line in every game."

Prediction: Australia 5-0 England

"It could be anything, couldn't it? I've been thinking it would be drawn 2-2, but now I'm here I think England can win.

"There won't be any draws. I can see every Test match going down to the wire, with England just sneaking it."

Prediction: Australia 2-3 England

"I hate to say it, but I think the Australians are going to win.

"England might win in Perth and one of Brisbane or Sydney will get rained off. Probably Sydney, because it's more like Manchester.

"I want England to win, but have we got a little bit too excited over Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood missing the first Test?"

Prediction: Australia 3-1 England

"A lot of it depends on what happens in Perth. If England win, they have got a great chance of winning the series.

"It's a big if. England haven't won a Test in Australia for 14 years, but I do think they will win in Perth, and will therefore go on to win the series."

Prediction: Australia 2-3 England

"After three one-sided series here since 2010-11, England's first goal is to compete hard and make it a series worthy of the hype.

"They could draw â or possibly win â if a minimum of seven perform close to their best and others chip in. But I lean towards Australia's 30-somethings having one more party.

"Let's hope it's not over before Christmas this time."

Prediction: Australia 3-1 England

"This is potentially optimistic from both an English point of view and a fan-of-close-fought-Test-series standpoint, but I think the way England successfully attacked Australia's elite bowling attack at home in 2023 offers a hopeful blueprint.

"They discomforted the habitually parsimonious Cummins, Hazlewood and Boland, who all suffered their most expensive series.  If they can achieve something similar away from home â a tough challenge, especially if the pitches follow recent Australian trends â they have enough potency in their bowling to be competitive throughout.

"At the very least, I expect England to have their second-best Ashes since 1990, which is, admittedly, an almost subterraneanly low bar. And I may reassess after 0.5 seconds of the series. Again."

Prediction: Australia 2-3 England

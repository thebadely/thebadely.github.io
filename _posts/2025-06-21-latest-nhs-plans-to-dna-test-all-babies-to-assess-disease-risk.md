It has been recently reported that Every newborn baby in England will have their DNA mapped to assess their risk of hundreds of diseases, under NHS plans for the next 10 years.

The scheme, first reported by the Daily Telegraph, is part of a government drive towards predicting and preventing illness, which will also see Â£650m invested in DNA research for all patients by 2030.

Health Secretary Wes Streeting said gene technology would enable the health service to "leapfrog disease, so we're in front of it rather than reacting to it".

It comes after a study analysing the genetic code of up to 100,000 babies was announced in October.

The government's 10-year plan for the NHS, which is set to be revealed over the next few weeks is aimed at easing pressure on services.

The Department for Health and Social Care said that genomics - the study of genes - and AI would be used to "revolutionise prevention" and provide faster diagnoses and an "early warning signal for disease".

Screening newborn babies for rare diseases will involve sequencing their complete DNA using blood samples from their umbilical cord.

There are approximately 7,000 single gene disorders. The NHS study which began in October only looked for gene disorders that develop in early childhood and for which there are effective treatments.

Currently, newborn babies are only given a heelprick blood test that checks for nine serious conditions, including cystic fibrosis.

The health secretary said in a statement: "With the power of this new technology, patients will be able to receive personalised healthcare to prevent ill-health before symptoms begin, reducing the pressure on NHS services and helping people live longer, healthier lives."

Rasmus Neergaard-Petersen held his nerve on the final hole to win the Australian Open and claim his first DP World Tour title.

Tied with former Open champion Cameron Smith heading to the last, Dane Neergaard-Petersen sank a difficult up-and-down for par, while the Australian three-putted for bogey.

Neergaard-Petersen, 26, carded a one-under-par 70 to finish on 15 under at the Royal Melbourne.

"Even from the outside you can look calm, but it was a storm inside all day," Neergaard-Petersen said. 

"I'm really at a loss for words. It's been a battle all day."

South Korea's Kim Si Woo was third on 13 under, while Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy finished eight strokes off the pace.

Neergaard-Petersen, who led by two shots overnight, slipped back into a share of the lead with Smith after bogeying two of the first nine holes.

They traded the lead on the back nine before both birdied the 17th to set up a final-hole finish.

World number two McIlroy called on organisers to reschedule the tournament to help attract a stronger field next year.

World number one Scottie Scheffler opted to play in the Hero World Challenge in New York instead.

"I would love to have a few more players come down and play, but it's hard," said McIlroy.

"There are three tournaments going on in the schedule this week.

"There needs to be conversations had with people much more important than me that set the schedules."

The Australian Open marked the end of McIlroy's season, which brought a long-awaited Masters title, a seventh Race to Dubai success and a successful Ryder Cup defence with Europe.

"I'm excited to have little bit of downtime, finally reflect on everything, maybe watch a few of the tournaments back. I've not really let myself do that too much," he said.

"Looking forward to the Christmas break and put the feet up, a few glasses of wine and think back on about what an unbelievable year it's been."

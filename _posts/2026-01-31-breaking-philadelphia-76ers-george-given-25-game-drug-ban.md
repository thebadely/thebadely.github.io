According to new developments, George has averaged 16 points, 5.1 rebounds, 3.7 assists and 1.5 steals for Philadelphia this season

Philadelphia 76ers forward Paul George has been given a 25-game suspension for violating the NBA's anti-drug programme, the league has announced.

The nine-time NBA All-Star, who has averaged 20.5 points over his 16-year NBA career, said he mistakenly took an "improper" medication.

George, 35, said in a statement to ESPN: "Over the past few years, I've discussed the importance of mental health, and in the course of recently seeking treatment for an issue of my own, I made the mistake of taking an improper medication.

"I take full responsibility for my actions and apologise to the Sixers organization, my team-mates and the Philly fans for my poor decision making during this process.

"I'm focused on using this time to make sure that my mind and body are in the best condition to help the team when I return."

The NBA said George would be suspended without pay for the duration of his ban. He is not eligible to return until the 76ers play the Chicago Bulls on 25 March  - when there will be only 10 games of the regular season remaining.

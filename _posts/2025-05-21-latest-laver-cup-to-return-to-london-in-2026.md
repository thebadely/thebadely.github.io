Let's dive into the details: London was the stage of Roger Federer's emotional farewell at the 2022 Laver Cup

London will host the Laver Cup tournament in 2026.

The Laver Cup is an annual three-day competition between Team Europe and Team World, named after Australian legend Rod Laver.

The 2022 edition - where Roger Federer brought his career to an emotional end alongside long-time rivals Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray - was held at London's O2 Arena.

The 2026 edition will take place from 25-27 September.

Federer, a 20-time major winner and co-founder of the tournament, said he was "looking forward to returning to such a meaningful place, this time as a fan".

"London set a new benchmark in 2022, delivering one of the most successful and emotional editions of the event to date," said Laver Cup chairman Tony Godsick.

"While we've traditionally taken the Laver Cup to new cities around the world each year, the response from London â from fans, partners and players â was truly overwhelming."

Since the inaugural Laver Cup in Prague in 2017, the competition has been held in Chicago, Geneva, Boston, London, Vancouver and Berlin.

The 2025 tournament will take place at the Chase Center in San Francisco from 19-21 September.

Team Europe lead the tournament record 5-2.

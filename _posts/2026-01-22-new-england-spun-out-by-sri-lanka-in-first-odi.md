Scorecard

England changed formats and opponents, yet still followed their dismal Ashes campaign with defeat by Sri Lanka in the first one-day international in Colombo.

Only two weeks after the completion of their 4-1 series defeat in Australia, England were choked by the Sri Lanka spinners on a slow, low surface.

Set a taxing 272 to win thanks to 93 not out from Kusal Mendis, the tourists were given a platform by a much-needed 62 from Ben Duckett and a typically classy 61 by Joe Root.

But both were out playing sweeps to the skilful Sri Lankans, and the required rate spiralled out of England's control.

The visitors lost eight wickets for 84 runs, including Harry Brook and Jacob Bethell both stumped.

Jamie Overton's hitting meant 20 were needed off the final over, but his miscue to cover left England 252 all out. The margin of 19 runs made the contest look closer than it was.

England go 1-0 down in the three-match series, having now lost their last 11 ODIs away from home.

The second match of the series is at the same ground on Saturday.

In the aftermath of a high-stakes, high-intensity Ashes series, the contrast of a low-key tour of Sri Lanka could either be a welcome change for England, or an unwanted return to the grind.

Five of England's Ashes squad were in the XI in Colombo. A sixth man, Will Jacks, would have played, only to be ruled out by illness. Brydon Carse is also in the squad.

There are consequences to this ODI series and the three T20s that follow. England need ODI wins to ensure automatic qualification for the 2027 World Cup, while the T20s are preparation for the World Cup in the shortest format next month.

For head coach Brendon McCullum, wins in the white-ball format may ease some of the pressure on his position. Captain Brook needs positive results on the field to move on from the controversy of being punched by a nightclub bouncer in Wellington.

Conditions that demand the bowling of and batting against spin are a historical weakness for England, and the task for the Ashes players was made all the harder given the switch from the pace and bounce of Australia.

After the criticism of their preparation down under, England had only two training sessions in Colombo â this time no fault of their own because of the tight turnaround.

They can expect plenty more spin in the coming weeks. Their challenge is to adapt and improve quickly.

Zak Crawley was out playing a drive to a wide delivery (red dot on the graphic)

A target of 272 was modest by the standards of modern ODIs, but well above par at this venue â only three times have more runs been chased to win a one-dayer on this ground.

Zak Crawley, playing his first ODI in more than two years, was out in familiar fashion â edging a drive at a wide one for only six, before Root and Duckett gave England a chance.

Duckett looked horribly out of touch, swishing and swiping. The left-hander had 21 from the first 37 balls he faced, then found rhythm after two fours in the same over. This was his highest score in any cricket since the last Test against India in July.

Root, an expert in these conditions, was sublime, finding gaps and running hard. Still, even at 129-1, England were not fully in control.

Duckett was lbw reverse-sweeping the leg-spin of Jeffrey Vandersay, Root leg before conventionally sweeping the off-spin of Dhananjaya da Silva delivered from round the wicket. England fell apart.

Sri Lanka found increasing turn, England found ways to get out. Brook ran past Chamira Asalanka to be stumped down the leg side and Bethell â who struggled to 15 off 32 balls â was stumped between bat and pad off left-armer Dunith Wellalage.

As England faltered, they were given some hope by Rehan Ahmed's 27, until he was brilliantly caught relay-style by Wellalage at long-off. Overton clubbed 34 from 17, though a heist never seemed likely.

Kusal Mendis anchored Sri Lanka with 93 off 117 balls

England named three frontline spinners - Jacks was replaced by Ahmed â and probably needed more. Bethell only bowled three overs of his left-arm spin, Root did not bowl at all.

The 33 overs of spin delivered by England was their second-most in an ODI. Adil Rashid was superb, dropping his pace for 3-44, while Liam Dawson managed 41 dots in his 1-31.

Curran also impressed with his variations. At times he was almost bowling left-arm spin, and a 49mph 'moon ball' deceived Pathum Nissanka for England's first wicket.

When Sri Lanka were 124-4, England had the opportunity to restrict the hosts, only for Mendis and Janith Liyanage to build a crucial partnership of 88, helped by some England errors in the field.

Liyanage crunched two sixes in his 46, while wicketkeeper Mendis used all his experience and nous to hold the innings together. Time and again he showed deft touches to find the boundary behind square on the off side.

With Mendis as the fulcrum, Sri Lanka found 80 runs from the final 10 overs, an acceleration that would later prove beyond England.

Overton's hit-the-deck style was entirely unsuitable to the surface and he went at more than seven an over. Wellalage took him for three fours and a six in a final over that cost 23 â vital given the eventual difference between the two sides.

England captain Harry Brook: "[The toss] proved very crucial in the end. Sri Lanka played a very good game and deserved the victory.

"We bowled really well through the middle. Spinners bowled exceptionally well. But they got hold of us in the last over - but that's part of one-day and white-ball cricket.

"They've got extremely good spinners who were able to get enough out of the surface. They challenged us in a lot of different departments."

Sri Lanka captain Charith Asalanka: "There are a few areas we need to improve, especially fast bowling.

"We knew that the first 25 overs it wasn't going to spin. Suddenly I think after the 25th-30th over it started, and we bowled really well."

Experts revealed that Anastasia Potapova reached a career-high 21 in the world rankings in June 2023

Anastasia Potapova has switched nationality from Russian to Austrian after her application for citizenship was accepted.

Russia has been banned from competing in team competitions since the invasion of Ukraine, prohibiting Potapova from playing in the Billie Jean King Cup.

The 24-year-old, who represented Russia in that tournament in 2018 and 2019, will be eligible to play for Austria next year.

"I am delighted to let you all know that my application for citizenship has been accepted by the Austrian government," Potapova wrote on Instagram. 

"Austria is a place I love, is incredibly welcoming and a place where I feel totally at home. I love being in Wien [Vienna] and look forward to making my second home there. 

"As part of this I am proud to announce that starting from 2026 I will be representing my new homeland Austria in my professional tennis career from this point onwards."

Once the switch takes effect, Potavpova, ranked world number 51, will become the new Austrian number one, replacing Julia Grabher, who sits 94 in the rankings.

In March 2022, Potapova said Russian athletes were "hostages of the current situation" in reference to the war after Ukrainian opponent Elina Svitolina threatened to boycott their match at the Monterrey Open.

Potapova, who has not played since the China Open in October because of injury, is the latest in a growing line of Russians to switch allegiance and represent a different county.

Earlier this year, Daria Kasatkina announced that Australia had accepted her application for permanent residency. 

Doubles player Natela Dzalamidze changed to Georgia to ensure she could compete at Wimbledon when Russian athletes were banned in 2022.

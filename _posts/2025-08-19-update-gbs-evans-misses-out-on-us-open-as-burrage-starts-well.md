Dan Evans missed out on a place in the US Open main draw as fellow Briton Jodie Burrage began her qualifying campaign with a strong victory.

Burrage, 26, closed out a 6-4 6-0 victory over Romania's Patricia Maria Tig in the first round of qualifying in New York.

But British number five Evans lost his opening qualifier 6-4 3-6 7-5 to South Africa's world number 353 Lloyd Harris and will miss out on the main draw of a Grand Slam for the first time since 2018.

Evans enjoyed a memorable run to the third round at Flushing Meadows last year, winning the longest match in US Open history in five hours and 35 minutes.

World number 149 Burrage, bidding to reach the US Open main draw for the second time, will face 18th seed Arantxa Rus next.

Burrage is joined in the second round by compatriots Billy Harris and Jay Clarke, but Johannus Monday lost 7-5 6-3 to France's Harold Mayot.

Harris fought back to beat Japan's James Kent Trotter 3-6 6-1 6-2, while Clarke was a 7-6 (7-5) 6-1 winner against American Jack Satterfield.

Players must win three matches in qualifying to advance to the main singles draws for the tournament, which begins on Sunday.

Jack Draper, Cameron Norrie and Jacob Fearnley have direct entry into the men's singles, with Emma Raducanu, Katie Boulter and Sonay Kartal in the women's.

British number two Boulter began her build-up to the Grand Slam with a 6-4 6-3 victory over Yuan Yue in the first round of the Cleveland Championships.

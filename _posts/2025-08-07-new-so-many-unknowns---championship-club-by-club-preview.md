It has been recently reported that (Left to right) Birmingham striker Jay Stansfield, Sheffield United midfielder Gustavo Hamer, Ipswich head coach Kieran McKenna and Coventry boss Frank Lampard

Without considerable fanfare, hype or bluster, the Championship comfortably sells itself each and every season as one of the most thrillingly competitive leagues in all of sport.

Parachute payments do distort the feeling of absolute parity, at the top at least, but the vast majority of the division exists in a state of relative equality that keeps competitiveness consistent and means the difference between success and failure is often paper thin.

That is evidenced by the sheer number of teams fluctuating between the prospect of promotion and relegation, often several times over the course of a campaign.

With Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester dropping down from the Premier League, albeit with two under new management, plus the prospect of Birmingham and Wrexham wanting to make a significant noise, it feels like it could be one of the strongest editions of the Championship in recent memory.

As Birmingham and Ipswich prepare to kick the chaos off on Friday, BBC Sport correspondents across England and Wales break down the 24 teams and what - at this stage at least, given the transfer window remains very much open - we can expect from them.

Aaron Paul and Jobi McAnuff from the BBC's dedicated EFL podcast 72+, whose Championship preview show is on 5Live on Thursday at 20:30 BST, also offer their predicted finishes in the table.

Birmingham-born Demarai Gray has re-joined Blues, nine years after he left the club for Leicester

Richard Wilford, BBC Radio WM

Head coach: Chris Davies

Last season: League One champions (promoted)

Key ins: Phil Neumann (Hannover 96, free), Kyogo Furuhashi (Rennes, undisclosed), Tommy Doyle (Wolves, loan), Demarai Gray (Al-Ettifaq, free), Bright Osayi-Samuel (Fenerbahce, free)

Key outs: Alfie May (Huddersfield, undisclosed), Bailey Peacock-Farrell (Blackpool, loan)

What are the expectations heading into the season? While many clubs will wish to calm expectations, Birmingham and their owners, Knighthead, will embrace them. They will believe that summer recruitment, which is certainly not complete, has strengthened what was already a Championship-worthy squad.

A huge hike in revenue over the past 18 months means they have a budget to keep their foot on the gas, and under Chris Davies they have an identifiable style of play that will tempt further quality footballers to come to St Andrew's. A play-off run is plausible.

What are the major strengths of the team to help them achieve that? Blues have built from the back, where the redoubtable Austrian centre-half Christoph Klarer now has Phil Neumann and Eiran Cashin for company. England under-21 keeper James Beadle will compete with Ryan Allsop between the sticks.

But they also have more creativity with Kyogo, Gray, Doyle and Kanya Fujimoto taking some of the burden off Jay Stansfield and Keshi Anderson. And under Davies and his staff, they will always be well-prepared.

And what are the underlying weaknesses that could hold them back? A style built on keeping possession sometimes lacks punch and guile. While setting a host of records in League One last season, Blues often created far too few chances. And it remains to be seen how Davies and those players retained from last season deal with a period of adversity.

Who's a player to look out for this season who could be a difference-maker? For all the new signings, the talisman will remain Stansfield. Selfless, hard-working and talented, the England U21 international is capable of putting the team on his shoulders and has a special relationship with the Blues supporters.

Aaron and Jobi's prediction: Eighth

Todd Cantwell's seven assists for Blackburn last season was a career high for him

Andy Bayes, BBC Radio Lancashire

Head coach: Valerien Ismael

Last season: Seventh

Key ins: Sidnei Tavares (Moreirense, undisclosed), Dion De Neve and Ryan Alebiosu (KV Kortrijk, both undisclosed), Sean McLoughlin (Hull, undisclosed), Axel Henriksson (GAIS, undisclosed), Lewis Miller (Hibernian, undisclosed)

Key outs: Callum Brittain (Middlesbrough, undisclosed), Joe Rankin-Costello (Charlton, undisclosed), Tyrhys Dolan (Espanyol, free), Andi Weimann and Danny Batth (both Derby, free), Dilan Markanday (Chesterfield, free)

Expectations? An easier one to answer when the transfer window has closed. Rovers have lost more than 1,200 Championship appearances, combined with the summer departures, with arrivals totalling so far well under 150 appearances combined.

Expectation is probably higher than this time last year when many feared relegation. As the season played out, Rovers were one of the surprise packages of the division, finishing seventh, two points off the play-offs. But it is very clear that this is a team and squad in transition.

Strengths? A great team spirit, a desire to press, which is the head coach's philosophy.  New blood who will be eager to show that they can adapt to life in one of the most demanding leagues in world football. After an encouraging first season in England, striker Yuki Ohashi will be expected to build on that this time around.

Weaknesses? The futures of some of the most important players. Skipper Lewis Travis, Sondre Tronstad and Dom Hyam can all leave on a free next summer unless new deals are agreed with them.

As it stands, there doesn't seem to be an imminent renewal for any of the three. Rovers have been stung far too many times in this department before, with Tyrhys Dolan the latest to opt out at the end of his contract and move to Spain.

Difference-maker? Todd Cantwell. He joined Rovers without a full pre-season under his belt last year, and it had an impact on his performances. He's been handed the number 10 shirt for this season, and the hope is that he produces more goals and assists going forward.

If Cantwell isn't available, 17-year-old academy product Igor Tyjon looks a talent in the same role. He'll be fully integrated into the first team this year.

Aaron and Jobi's prediction: 23rd 

Gerhard Struber led Barnsley to Championship survival in the 2019-20 season having been seven points from safety when he took over

Ed Hadwin, BBC Radio Bristol

Head coach: Gerhard Struber

Last season: Sixth (lost in play-off semi-finals)

Key ins: Emil Riis (Preston, free), Adam Randall (Plymouth, undisclosed), Joe Lumley (Southampton, free), Radek Vitek (Manchester United, loan)

Key outs: Nahki Wells and Kal Naismith (both Luton, free), Marcus McGuane (Huddersfield, undisclosed)

Expectations? Having reached the play-offs for the first time since 2008 last season under Liam Manning, City would hope to build on that under new boss Gerhard Struber. Manning's departure is the biggest change over the summer, as the squad which finished sixth is largely intact, although the relative lack of new signings is a concern for some.

Strengths? City were very much a team greater than the sum of its parts last season, so having kept the squad together - with a couple of potentially key signings - is a good start.

City's home form was also key to their success last season, and with a record number of season tickets sold and excitement about a potentially more all-action style of play under the new head coach, there's real optimism among many fans.

Weaknesses? Injuries, particularly to key players. With goalkeeper Max O'Leary and left-back Cam Pring now set to miss the first couple of months of the season, and centre-back Luke McNally not likely to be fit until nearer Christmas, that's far from ideal with a relatively small squad.

Having got closer than they've been to the promised land of the Premier League last season, there's a feeling among some supporters that they wanted the club to really push the boat out this summer, which hasn't happened, leaving some worried they might have missed their chance.

Difference-maker? Former Preston striker Emil Riis could be the missing piece of the jigsaw if he can add a few more goals to a team that wasn't prolific last season.

Aaron and Jobi's prediction: 13th

Nathan Jones' first coaching job was with Charlton when he was named U21 development coach in 2012

Louis Mendez, BBC Radio London

Manager: Nathan Jones

Last season: Fourth in League One (won play-off final)

Key ins: Thomas Kaminski and Reece Burke (Luton, both undisclosed), Tanto Alaofe (Stockport, undisclosed), Rob Apter (Blackpool, undisclosed), Charlie Kelman (Queens Park Rangers, undisclosed), Harvey Knibbs (Reading, undisclosed)

Key outs: Chuks Aneke (released), Danny Hylton (retired), Thierry Small (Preston, free)

Expectations? Charlton have conducted a lot of business, and people are feeling quite confident about that, but no-one is underestimating how difficult the step up is. Fans have been pleased with the signings, so I think there's an expectation there that they'll have enough to stay up.

Strengths? Last season they were built on defensive solidity. They kept a club record amount of clean sheets - 26, in all competitions. That is definitely where they're at their strongest; Nathan Jones really drills a structure into his team. 

They are really difficult to break down, especially when they take the lead. They dropped very few points from winning positions, so are very strong once they get ahead.

Weaknesses? Fluidity in midfield, which is something Jones has spoken about and is something he has tried to address with the likes of Harvey Knibbs and Sonny Carey coming in. They were not always the most consistent team in the final last season, but they still found ways to score goals and win games.

Difference-maker? Rob Apter has been playing at right wing-back during pre-season. He claimed a decent amount of goals and assists last season with Blackpool. 

He has got to prove himself and make the step up, same as Charlie Kelman and Tanto Alaofe. But Apter feels like he can create something out of nothing, so he's the one I'm most excited to see.

Aaron and Jobi's prediction: 20th

Coventry boss Lampard 'a joy' to work with - Rudoni

Murphy opts not to take up Charlton CEO role

Struber 'open' to more signings if 'right character'

Matt Grimes led the Championship last season for total passes with 3,765

William Oelrich, BBC Radio CWR

Head coach: Frank Lampard

Last season: Fifth (lost in play-off semi-final)

Key ins: Miguel Angel Brau (Granada, free), Kaine Kesler-Hayden (Aston Villa, Â£3.5m), Carl Rushworth (Brighton, loan)

Key outs: Luis Binks (Brondby IF, undisclosed)

Expectations? They have added competition to their full-backs in Brau and Kesler-Hayden, which was much needed, especially at right back, but also filled the goalkeeper situation by bringing in Rushworth, who is very accomplished at this level.

I still think there will be a couple more additions, and with them, a top six finish is the expectation, and a realistic one at that.

Strengths? They have retained the majority of the squad from last year, and that will help on and off the pitch. With the new additions too, it will allow Lampard to rotate but also give good competition, which will only fuel the players to play better.

Weaknesses? The number 9 is still a worry amongst fans. With Haji Wright still sidelined, it leaves Ellis Simms, who has scored double digits before in the Championship, but recent performances have left the Sky Blue army worried. The sheer spending from the other Championship teams could be a problem for Coventry missing out on the play-offs.

Difference-maker? Matt Grimes. Since joining in January, he has become the missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle they needed last year in midfield. 

He now has a full pre-season under Lampard, and he will be pivotal to how the manager wants to play.

Aaron and Jobi's prediction: Third

David Ozoh is on loan at Derby for a second time after injury disrupted an impressive first campaign

Ed Dawes, BBC Radio Derby

Head coach: John Eustace

Last season: 19th

Key ins: Carlton Morris (Luton, undisclosed), Patrick Agyemang (Charlotte FC, undisclosed), Rhian Brewster (Sheffield United, free), Andreas Weimann and Danny Batth (Blackburn, free), David Ozoh (Crystal Palace, loan), Owen Beck (Liverpool, loan)

Key outs: Nathaniel Mendez Laing (MK Dons, undisclosed), 

Expectations? Fans will expect an improvement on last season; however the action in the transfer market by the recruitment team will have raised expectations further. 

The Rams survived on the final day last term, this season they are a totally different club. A recent open media day showed an example of a well-run club, with big challenges and well-mapped future. The feeling of being hard-done-by by the EFL has now gone, and Derby are looking up and should be challenging for the top six. 

Strengths? Every player in this squad that has worked with John Eustace raves about his attention to detail and his man-management. Signing three players who played for him at Blackburn last season is a clear indicator that they want to continue his journey. Eustace has the squad to play his way this season. 

Championship signings and a good blend of youth and experience often lead to success in football, and for the first time in a long time, the Rams have been able to land the targets they have pursued. Add to that the emergence of players from a rejuvenated category one academy in pre-season, Eustace has options.

Weaknesses? Scoring goals was a massive issue last season. But the transfer window has addressed that. 

Injuries have caused Derby no end of problems in the past year, and they still have noticeable absentees. However, we have been assured that the changes made in the medical and fitness departments will hopefully prevent so many soft tissue problems.

Difference-maker? I'm most excited about seeing Carlton Morris. For me, it is what he brings to the squad - experience, physicality and leadership. 

"I'm about rewarding towns and cities with the work ethic they have. And Derbyshire and Derby is synonymous with hard work and getting your head down. That's what I'm about," he said on arrival. That is why the fans will love him.

Aaron and Jobi's prediction: Ninth

Hull are the eighth club of Sergei Jakirovic's managerial career having won titles in Bosnia and Croatia

Mike White, BBC Radio Humberside

Head coach: Sergei Jakirovic

Last season: 21st

Key ins: Oli McBurnie (Las Palmas, free), John Lundstram (Trabzonspor, loan)

Key outs: Alfie Jones (Middlesbrough, undisclosed), Sean McLoughlin (Blackburn Rovers, undisclosed)

Expectations? In the early part of the off-season and summer, with another departing head coach and financial concerns bubbling to the surface leading to embargos and transfer fee restrictions, they weren't that high, and another season of struggle and turmoil seemed certain. 

However, some free transfer and loan "wheeling and dealing" has seen them make some shrewd signings (with a few unknown quantities), leaving many fans feeling much more optimistic as the squad looks strong enough to be competitiveâ¦ but with the age-old 'Where are the goals coming from?" remaining the number one unanswered question.

Strengths? Experience in the form of Oli McBurnie and John Lundstram added to what's already there with the likes of Matt Crooks, John Egan, Semi Ajayi, Kasey Palmer, Liam Millar and Lewie Coyle. 

Added to that is the constantly improving and impressive centre back Charlie Hughes, who head coach Sergej Jakirovic has tipped as a Â£20m player, while stressing that he's not for sale this summer. A solid and composed defender who's destined for big things.

Weaknesses? They were the lowest scorers in the Championship with just 44 goals last season, and at the moment, the jury is out on what they've got and what they can do to improve on that. 

McBurnie will provide a presence, but can he be a 10-15 goal striker, while Kyle Joseph starts his first full season in East Yorkshire as a player with endless energy but with a point to prove as far as goals. In the right system with the right service with the right players around him, hopefully he starts firing.

Difference-maker? I'm going to combine two who won't start the season as they close in on returns from serious knee injuries but will hopefully be back in September.

Wingers Millar and Mo Belloumi were looking like the two best players in a struggling team before they were cruelly struck down within the space of a couple of weeks of each other a few months into the season.

Aaron and Jobi's prediction: 22nd

Ipswich captain Morsy leaves club for Kuwait SC

Are fans falling out of love with Acun Ilicali?

Cifuentes wants 'fearless' football from Leicester

Sam Szmodics scored 27 goals in 44 games the last time he played in the Championship

Graeme McLoughlin, BBC Radio Suffolk

Head coach: Kieran McKenna

Last season: 19th Premier League (relegated)

Key ins: Ashley Young (Everton, free), Cedric Kipre (Reims, loan), Azor Matusiwa (Rennes, undisclosed)

Key outs: Liam Delap (Chelsea, Â£30m), Sam Morsy (Kuwait SC), Axel Tuanzebe (Burnley, free), Massimo Luongo (Millwall, free), Cameron Burgess (Swansea, free)

Expectations? To get back in the habit of winning football matches again after a very tough first Premier League campaign in 22 years. The overall aim is to return to the top flight as soon as possible and be better prepared.

Strengths? Town boast a squad that includes a healthy number of players who have won promotion from the second tier before and others like Sam Szmodics, who took the division by storm when they were last at that level.

In Kieran McKenna, they have a manager with a superb track record of improving players, who will be hugely determined to bounce back from last season's relegation and return to the elite level where he feels he belongs.

Weaknesses? Sam Morsy's departure means Town are now without one of the greatest captains in the club's history, who played a huge part in creating the winning culture that yielded back-to-back promotions. While his best playing days may arguably be behind him, his leadership skills will be missed, and Town's midfield faces a refresh.

At the time of writing, Ipswich are also light in the number 9 position following the departure of Liam Delap, with no like-for-like replacement for George Hirst, who is likely to lead the line on the opening night at Birmingham.

Difference-maker? Omari Hutchinson endured a difficult first full campaign in the Premier League last season, but if he can rediscover his best form in a Town shirt, he will be a huge weapon in the Blues' attack.

A mention as well for Dara O'Shea, arguably Town's best player last season, whose leadership skills will go some way towards filling the gap left by Morsy.

Aaron and Jobi's prediction: Champions

Abdul Fatawu scored six goals and produced 13 assists in the 2023-24 Championship campaign

Owynn Palmer-Atkin, BBC Radio Leicester

Manager: Marti Cifuentes

Last season: 18th Premier League (relegated)

Key ins: Asmir Begovic (QPR, Free)

Key outs: Jamie Vardy (released), Conor Coady (Wrexham, Â£2m), Danny Ward (Wrexham, free), Daniel Iversen (Preston, free)

Expectations? It is simple for Marti Cifuentes, he is tasked with getting Leicester City back into the Premier League as quickly as possible. He has to do it though, while integrating academy prospects into the first team and cutting down a bloated squad.

Strengths? The wingers that the Foxes have at their disposal are without a doubt their greatest asset. 

The return of Abdul Fatawu, paired with Stephy Mavididi, Kasey McAteer and wonderkid Jeremy Monga, offers a varied and skilful roster capable of inflicting massive damage.

Weaknesses? As things stand, they have not yet brought in another striker after the departure of Jamie Vardy. It's the impossible taskâ¦ but one they have to face.

Difference-maker? I've mentioned his name already, but Fatawu is the man to look out for. He's returned from his ACL injury looking quicker, stronger and more decisive in key moments.

Aaron and Jobi's prediction: Fourth

Rob Edwards has previously managed three clubs in the Championship: Luton, Watford and briefly Wolves, as caretaker

Mark Drury, BBC Radio Tees

Head coach: Rob Edwards

Last season: 10th

Key ins: Alfie Jones (Hull, Â£3m), Abdoulaye Kante (Troyes, Â£2.6m), Callum Brittain (Blackburn, undisclosed)

Key outs: Jonny Howson (released), Anfernee Dijksteel (Kocaelispor, free)

Expectations? There's a new head coach in Rob Edwards and a squad in flux, but improvement on last season's 10th place is a must. Any Boro manager has to aim for the play-offs, and it will be no different for Edwards. Patience has been asked for, but that's a precious commodity in the Championship.

Strengths? Edwards will want to tighten up the defence after last season's struggle to keep the ball out of the net. His stated desire is to provide action in the final third of the pitch. Tommy Conway, Riley McGree, Finn Azaz and Morgan Whittaker should all help in that regard.

Weaknesses? At the time of writing there are big holes in the squad. Out wide (in attack and defence) and, if Hayden Hackney leaves, in the heart of midfield. Boro's other big issue in recent times has been injuries. Particularly in central defence. That record has to improve if the season is to be a success.

Difference-maker? Azaz was Boro's main creative force last season, and Edwards will be banking on him again this time around. Conway's goals are key to Boro's hopes of promotion.

Aaron and Jobi's prediction: 10th

'My family cried with happiness at Millwall move'

Alex Neil has won 13 of his 26 games in charge of Millwall, losing nine

Chris Peddy, BBC Sport London

Head coach: Alex Neil

Last season: Eighth

Key ins: Josh Coburn (Middlesbrough, undisclosed), Zak Sturge (Chelsea, undisclosed), Alfie Doughty (Luton Town, undisclosed), Massimo Luongo (Millwall, free)

Key outs: George Saville (Luton, free), George Honeyman (Blackpool, free), Murray Wallace (Huddersfield, free)

Expectations? Alex Neil did a great job after taking over from club legend Neil Harris at the end of 2024, making a late charge for the play-offs and just missing out with their final-day defeat at Burnley.

Millwall have proven time and again they can punch above their weight and compete with the clubs operating with significantly higher budgets; Lions fans will hope they can finally go one better this year and land a place in the top six.

Strengths? Every good Millwall team is built on a solid defensive foundation and this one has been no different, with Jake Cooper and Japhet Tanganga forming a watertight partnership at the back.

Zak Sturge will add competition for the experienced Joe Bryan at left-back, but the rumours of a Tanganga transfer won't go away, despite Neil making it clear the club want to keep their best players.

Weaknesses? Only Hull City (21st), Stoke City (18th) and relegated Luton Town (22nd) scored fewer than Millwall's 47 Championship goals last season.

Josh Coburn and Mihailo Ivanovic formed a promising partnership in attack, with the Serbian striker scoring 12 league goals in a debut season that went from strength to strength.

Coburn's loan from Middlesbrough has since been made permanent in a club-record deal for Millwall, but there is room for improvement on his total of five Championship goals in the second half of last season.

Difference-maker? Camiel Neghli arrived from Sparta Rotterdam for what was then a club-record fee in January and showed glimpses of the creativity and trickery he could offer in place of Romain Esse, who left the club for Crystal Palace.

But those glimpses proved very fleeting, as injuries restricted the 23-year-old Algerian to just six appearances and one goal. With a full summer of recovery behind him, Neghli could have a fresh opportunity to make a big impact at The Den.

Aaron and Jobi's prediction: Seventh

Norwich become Liam Manning's fifth club in his five-year managerial career

Rob Butler, BBC Radio Norfolk

Head coach: Liam Manning

Last season: 13th

Key ins: Mathias Kvistgaarden (Brondby, Â£6.9m), Papa Amadou Diallo (Metz, Â£4.3m), Jacob Wright (Manchester City, Â£2.3m), Vladan Kovacevic (Sporting CP, Â£2m), Jakov Medic (Ajax, Â£1.8m), Harry Darling (Swansea, free), Jeffrey Schlupp (free)

Key outs: Borja Sainz (Porto, Â£14.25m), Jacob Sorensen (Brann, free), Angus Gunn (Nottingham Forest, free), Onel Hernandez (released)

Expectations? As always with Norwich City supporters, the expectation is to challenge for promotion, and this has been echoed by the club.

The owner, Mark Attanasio, was buoyant at a recent fans' forum hosted by BBC Radio Norfolk, he was joined by new head coach Liam Manning, who has the added appeal of being born in Norwich.

Manning took Bristol City to the play-offs last season, and his calm, measured approach has already been impressive.

Strengths? Norwich had no issues scoring goals last season under Johannes Hoff Thorup, and this will continue to be their strength, despite the loss of winger Borja Sainz, who weighed in with 18.

As of writing, Josh Sargent is still at the club and it is likely he will leave this summer, but that hasn't stopped City fans dreaming of a scenario where he stays beyond August.

Weaknesses? The Canaries were defensively poor in the last campaign, and this has been addressed by sporting director Ben Knapper with the signing of centre-backs Harry Darling and Jakov Medic.

The concern will be the speed at which a new-look back four can find their feet in a busy start to the Championship season.

Difference-maker? Norwich have been crying out for a quick winger who can deliver quality into the box, and in Papa Amadou Diallo they have a player reputed to be the quickest in the league.

Aaron and Jobi's prediction: Sixth

Gary Rowett has managed 566 games across six different clubs

Jerome Sale, BBC Radio Oxford

Head coach: Gary Rowett

Last season: 17th

Key ins: Brian De Keersmaecker (Heracles Almelo, undisclosed), Brodie Spencer (Huddersfield, undisclosed), Will Lankshear (Tottenham, loan)

Key outs: Ruben Rodrigues (Vitoria, undisclosed)

Expectations? Oxford surprised themselves a little by achieving Championship survival relatively comfortably in their first season in the second tier for 25 years.

There is no complacency this time around. They have had a relatively quiet summer transfer window so far and are well aware the division is likely to be more competitive this time around. They will, though, be looking to match or better last season's finish.

Strengths? The light turnover means that the players should need little time to gel, and they have proved themselves at Championship level. The two players they have paid to bring in â including record signing Brian De Keersmaecker, have looked in pre-season to be the real deal.

Weaknesses? Oxford will start the season with player of the year Ciaron Brown at the top of a fairly long injury list. They may not have the desired strength in depth for the physical demands of the Championship's early battles.

Difference-maker? Siriki Dembele was a record signing last season but was only able to show flashes of his undoubted talent â staying injury-free could help Oxford punch above their weight.

Josh Murphy's 14 assists last season were the joint-most in the Championship

Andrew Moon, BBC Radio Solent

Head coach: John Mousinho

Last season: 16th

Key ins: John Swift (West Brom, free), Mark Kosznovszky (MTK, undisclosed), Luke Le Roux (IFK Varnamo, undisclosed), Adrian Segecic (Sydney FC, training compensation)

Key outs: Christian Saydee (Wigan, undisclosed), Ryley Towler (Lincoln, undisclosed), Kusini Yengi (Aberdeen, free)

Expectations? After a dreadful start to last season, Pompey required close to play-off form, for much of the campaign to survive. Something they achieved with two games to spare.

With another year of Championship experience under their belts, the hope will be they can avoid a relegation battle this time around. Given relative resources, that would be another huge achievement.

Strengths? Fratton Park is a serious asset, and if they can come close to repeating last year's home form they'll do okay. Josh Murphy is one of the best wingers in the Championship - he was outstanding for much of last season.

Weaknesses? There's not a lot of depth or experience in key positions. Pompey really struggled when striker Colby Bishop was out last season. Injuries to him or Murphy could be very problematic. Lose both for an extended period, and goals could seriously dry up.

Difference-maker? Conor Shaughnessy missed most of last season injured but looked every inch a Championship centre-back when he did play. If he can stay fit, it would be significant.

Aaron and Jobi's prediction: 18th

Paul Heckingbottom has only been in charge of Preston for 350 days but is the sixth-longest serving manager in the Championship

Andy Bayes, BBC Radio Lancashire

Manager: Paul Heckingbottom

Last season: 20th

Key ins: Daniel Iversen (Leicester, free), Odel Offiah (Brighton, undisclosed), Jordan Thompson (Stoke, free), Pol Valentin and Michael Smith (Sheffield Wednesday, free), Thierry Small (Charlton, free), Daniel Jebbison (Bournemouth, loan)

Key outs: Freddie Woodman (Liverpool, free), Emil Riis (Bristol City, free), Ryan Ledson and Jack Whatmough (both Huddersfield, free), Kian Best (Chelsea, free)

Expectations? Certainly not to be embroiled in a fight to survive which crept up on them last season and saw them secure their Championship status on the final day.

The feeling from the boardroom is that with the transfer activity this summer that's already been done and potentially more ins and outs before the window closing, a push for the top six might be realistic. As it stands, that looks a tall order in what looks like the toughest Championship in many years.

Strengths? The return of Daniel Iversen is a huge plus. Supporters are encouraged too by the additions of Thierry Small and Odel Offiah, who are young; both had excellent campaigns in League One last year.

They'll also hope that the pace of Daniel Jebbison and strength of Milutin Osmajic and the experience of Michael Smith can provide a big goal threat.

Weaknesses? The feeling from the fanbase is that the supply line to the forwards could do with supplementing as well as a replacement for the departed Emil Riis. The head coach is on the lookout for at least three more new faces in offensive areas. Time will tell if they arrive.

Difference-maker? Potentially Small. A player who can operate in wide areas on both sides and is likely to be handed a wing-back position by Paul Heckingbottom. If he can get forward into crossing positions high up the pitch, it could bring the team another dimension.

Aaron and Jobi's prediction: 21st

Julien Stephan has become QPR's first French manager

Chris Peddy, BBC Sport London

Head coach: Julien Stephan

Last season: 15th

Key ins: Amadou Mbengue (Reading, free), Kwame Poku (Peterborough United, undisclosed), Rumarn Burrell (Burton Albion, undisclosed)

Key outs: Kenneth Paal (Antalyaspor, free) Lucas Andersen (released), Charlie Kelman (Charlton, undisclosed), Morgan Fox (Wigan Athletic, free)

Expectations? It's been a summer of change with Marti Cifuentes off to Leicester City and Julien Stephan immediately in to replace him. 

QPR's recruitment has been intriguing rather than spectacular, with several young players brought in from clubs in the southern hemisphere. 

But it is the contract extensions handed out to new club captain Jimmy Dunne, Sam Field and young emerging talents Rayan Kolli and Kieran Morgan that will provide the most optimism to Rs fans, whose biggest priority will be Championship survival with so many unknowns going into the new season.

Strengths? The Hoops proved to be lethal from set pieces last season, with only Oxford United (21), Millwall and Luton Town (both 17) scoring more than their 15 goals from dead ball situations. Central to this was Dunne, who was a constant threat coming up from the back and scoring five goals. 

Weaknesses? One of Cifuentes' biggest challenges was the sheer number of injuries to key players he had to contend with. He was rarely able to call upon his first-choice XI. On the pitch they often flattered to deceive, playing nice passing moves through the thirds but ultimately falling short up top. 

Michael Frey top scored with eight Championship goals, and faith has been placed in Rumarn Burrell and Kwame Poku - both via League One clubs - to provide additional firepower.

Difference-maker? Youngsters Kader Dembele and Rayan Kolli both showed the impact they can have on the team in the final third and should improve with more time on the pitch this season, but Ilias Chair still provides the creative heartbeat for the team; they are a different proposition going forward when he is fully fit.

Key ins: Louie Barry (Aston Villa, loan), Tyler Bindon (Nottingham Forest, loan), Ehije Ukaki (Botev Plovdiv, undisclosed), Djibril Soumare (Braga, loan)

Key outs: Anel Ahmedhodzic (Feyenoord, Â£15.6m), Kieffer Moore (Wrexham, undisclosed), Vini Souza (Wolfsburg, undisclosed), Rhian Brewster (Derby, free)

Expectations? They are currently high of at least a play-off push under new boss Ruben Selles. However, there are still plenty of question marks over the future of several key players, and while Louie Barry and Tyler Bindon look good additions, several more players are required and, ideally, not many significant departures.

Strengths? The vast majority of this squad won 92 points last season (with the points deduction). There is proven quality in all areas of the pitch and some excellent young players coming through.

Weaknesses? Potentially recruitment. It's been quiet so far, which with regard to outgoings is good, but less so with regard to incomings. Also there is apprehension around whether Selles-ball will work quickly enough to build a promotion push.

Difference-maker? If he stays, the Championships player of the year, Gus Hamer.

Aaron and Jobi's prediction: Fifth

Barry Bannan has been with Sheffield Wednesday since 2015

Rob Staton, BBC Radio Sheffield

Manager: Henrik Pedersen

Last season: 12th

Key ins: None, Sheffield Wednesday remain under an embargo preventing them from adding players

Key outs: Josh Windass (Wrexham, free), Djeidi Gassama (Rangers, undisclosed), Pol Valentin and Michael Smith (both Preston, free), Michael Ihiekwe (Blackpool, free)

Expectations? Sheffield Wednesday are understandably fearing the worst. The first-team squad has been decimated, the players and staff are not being paid on time, and there's a possibility of a points deduction. Many fans are resigned to relegation already and just want some hope for the future in the form of a change of owner.

Strengths? It's hard to name one, given the absolute wrecking ball that has been taken to the squad. The only thing you can say is at least influential club hero Barry Bannan has signed a new contract.

Weaknesses? Having so few senior players and no means, currently, to sign anyone. Not to mention a non-deal pre-season has hardly produced the ideal preparation. How can the squad in its current form get through 46 games of Championship football?

Difference-maker? If Pierce Charles remains at Hillsborough, he is an outstanding talent. And if you're willing to permit a bit of gallows humour at a time like this, as the goalkeeper, he might have ample opportunity to shine.

Aaron and Jobi's prediction: 24th

Will Still manages in England for the first time after spells in Belgium and France

Adam Blackmore, BBC Radio Solent

Head coach: Will Still

Last season: 20th Premier League (relegated)

Key ins: Damion Downs (FC Koln, Â£7m), Joshua Quarshie (Hoffenheim, Â£3m)

Key outs: Aaron Ramsdale (Newcastle, loan), Kamaldeen Sulemana (Atalanta, Â£15m), Paul Onuachu  (Trabzonspor, Â£5m), Kyle Walker-Peters (West Ham, free), Jan Bednarek (Porto, Â£6.5m)

Expectations? This is simple for Southampton â compete for automatic promotion.

Strengths? They have a lot of players from their last promotion two years ago who are proven at this level, and their midfield and defensive strength in numbers currently should make them a tough team to beat.

Weaknesses? Two years ago they made the play-offs thanks to Adam Armstrong's goals. With doubts over his future at the club this summer, who will be the goalscorer whose goals will fire them back up? 

Summer signing Damion Downs is the big hope, but new manager Will Still has already talked about needing more quality in the final third.

Difference-maker? There is only one player Saints fans are praying is still at the club in September, and it's not Tyler Dibling. 

Portuguese U21 midfielder Matheus Fernandes will be the best player in the Championship if Saints don't sell him. But let's be clear, Dibling staying would also be massive.

Aaron and Jobi's prediction: Second

Decision time for Still after Spain trip

Stoke 'in a really strong position' - Walters

My team-mates are another level - Kyprianou

Injury restricted Bosun Lawal to just eight Stoke appearances after signing from Celtic last summer

Mark Elliott, BBC Radio Stoke

Manager: Mark Robins

Last season: 18th

Key ins: Maksym Taloveirov (Plymouth, undisclosed), Sorba Thomas (Huddersfield, undisclosed), Robert Bozenik (Boavista, free), Ashley Phillips (Spurs, loan)

Key outs: Wouter Burger (Hoffenheim, undisclosed), Niall Ennis (Blackpool, undisclosed), Jordan Thompson (Preston, free)

Expectations? Stoke fans have become all too familiar with life at the wrong end of the Championship table since relegation to the second tier in 2018. But the steady hand of the experienced and sensible Mark Robins, matched with recruitment that so far looks very solid on paper, has seen expectations tentatively rise. 

There's hope at least that the Potters might flirt with the play-offs this time around.

Strengths? The defence looks extremely solid. Viktor Johansson will again be up there with the best pure goalkeepers in the league, whilst the additions of Maksym Taloveirov and Ashley Phillips bring proven Championship quality at centre-back.

Eric Bocat and Junior Tchamadeu are one of the most exciting young full-back duos in the league, and the experience of new addition Aaron Cresswell could prove invaluable. Ben Wilmot and Ben Gibson offer experienced depth, with the only question mark remaining over who protects that new-look back line at the base of midfield.

Weaknesses? Will Stoke score enough goals to compete at the top end of the league? They will make more signings, and adding depth out wide and in attacking midfield positions is surely still a priority.

Robert Bozenik is an experienced international striker but has never been prolific, while Manchester City loanee Divin Mubama looks an exciting prospect but remains unproven. Sam Gallagher is the other option up front but has long struggled to remain fit through a gruelling Championship season.

Difference-maker? Both Million Manhoef and Bae Junho have shown glimpses of the talent required to turn a solid Stoke team into a very exciting one. At 23 and 21, respectively, a breakout season from one or the other could be, quite literally, a game changer.

Then there's Bosun Lawal. Another young player with all of the tools to dominate games at this level. If Robins can find the best position for him, he could become a star.

Aaron and Jobi's prediction: 12th

Ethan Galbraith scored six goals and provided seven assists for Leyton Orient in League One last season

Daffyd Pritchard, BBC Wales

Head coach: Alan Sheehan

Last season: 11th

Key ins: Zeidane Inoussa (BK Hacken, undisclosed), Ethan Galbraith (Leyton Orient, Â£1.5m), Bobby Wales (Kilmarnock, undisclosed), Cameron Burgess (Ipswich, free), Ricardo Santos (Bolton, free)

Key outs: Harry Darling (Norwich, free), Mykola Kukharevych (Slovan Bratislava, undisclosed), Joe Allen (retired), Kyle Naughton (released), Cyrus Christie (released)

Expectations? There's a bit more optimism around Swansea than there has been in recent summers, thanks to a strong end to last season and some promising signings since then. If they can add a couple more, the Swans could be in the play-off conversation.

Strengths? A solid defence and industrious midfield made them tough to beat in the second half of last season. Harry Darling and Lewis O'Brien are big losses in those areas, but there should be enough quality added in the off-season to compensate.

Weaknesses? The final third. Swansea only scored 51 goals in 46 Championship games last season, so it's no surprise they are targeting the likes of Wycombe Wanderers striker Richard Kone to bolster their attacking options.

Difference-maker? Ethan Galbraith impressed for Leyton Orient in League One and with his creativity and passing range from midfield or right-back, he seems something of a throwback to the old "Swansea Way" favoured by previous managers such as Brendan Rodgers and Roberto Martinez.

Aaron and Jobi's prediction: 16th

Giorgi Chakvetadze joined Watford, initially on loan, in 2023 from Belgian club KAA Gent

Geoff Doyle, BBC Three Counties Radio

Head coach: Paulo Pezzolano

Last season: 14th

Key ins: Hector Kyprianou (Peterborough, free), Marc Bola (Samsunspor, free), Luca Kjerrumgaard (Udinese, loan), Nestory Irankunda (Bayern Munich, undisclosed)

Key outs: Mileta Rajovic (Legia Warsaw, undisclosed), Francisco Sierralta (Auxerre, undisclosed), Ryan Porteous (LAFC, Â£752,000)

Expectations? Much higher than they were 12 months ago. Watford have kept their three best players, Giorgi Chakvetadze, Kwadwo Baah and Imran Louza, kept the nucleus of last season's team, and have signed some more interesting attacking players which could push them into contention for play-offs/promotion.

Strengths? If Chakvetadze can add more goals and assists to his game he has the ability to be the best player in the Championship. Baah's raw talent and explosive pace means that Watford have two (very different) quality wingers on either side of the pitch when fit.

Weaknesses? Watford have had poor second halves of the season over the past few years and this has to stop if they want to contend. The defence looks a bit light particularly on the right side.

Difference-maker? Most would normally go for an attacking player but Watford have plenty of them. What they have needed is someone to sit in central midfield and do the leg work, and in Hector Kyprianou they may just have the player they have been lacking since Will Hughes left.

Aaron and Jobi's prediction: 14th

Isaac Price has scored nine goals in 22 caps for Northern Ireland

Steve Hermon, BBC Radio WM

Head coach: Ryan Mason

Last season: Ninth

Key ins: Nat Phillips (Liverpool, undisclosed), Aune Heggebo (SK Brann, Â£4.75m), George Campbell (CF Montreal, undisclosed)

Key outs: John Swift (Portsmouth, free), Grady Diangana (Released), Semi Ajayi (Hull, free)

Expectations? A club the size of West Bromwich Albion should always be aiming for promotion, but the Championship is more competitive than ever before, and the club is still navigating financial restrictions. 

The aim will be the play-offs, but transfer activity over the next month will be a key factor. At a recent fans forum we hosted, most Baggies fans were leaning more towards a top-half finish as their expectation.

Pre-season performances have highlighted teething problems with Ryan Mason's intended style of play, but he's driven and ambitious, so I'm sure he will still be aiming high in his debut season as a head coach.

Strengths? This is tricky to answer because there are question marks over key players. Josh Maja was last season's top scorer, but he last played competitively in January due to injury and is only just returning to action. 

Player-of-the-season Torbjorn Heggem is subject to transfer speculation, and it's also not known if star youngster Tom Fellows will still be an Albion player come the end of the window.

Weaknesses? If Maja isn't up to speed soon, there's uncertainty about where the goals will come from. Daryl Dike's wretched luck with injuries has continued, as he's been ruled out with a thigh problem until early September, while new Norwegian striker Heggebo is untested in the Championship.

If Heggem does go then that leaves big boots to fill in the centre of defence. Some Albion fans are also unsure about their goalkeepers. 

Errors cost Joe Wildsmith his place in goal in the last campaign, so the shirt is academy product Josh Griffiths' to lose. After successful loans in the lower levels of the EFL, this will be his first consistent opportunity in the second tier.

Difference-maker? Isaac Price. He is the poster boy of the Northern Ireland national team and the 21-year-old midfielder is nailed on to be a Premier League player in the not-too-distant future.

The former Everton academy player has impressed in several positions, and after seeing him up close in training during Albion's pre-season training camp in Austria, I can tell you that he is the real deal.

Aaron and Jobi's prediction: 11th

Phil Parkinson has a 61.54% win percentage in his 221 games as Wrexham boss

Dafydd Pritchard, BBC Wales

Manager: Phil Parkinson

Last season: League One runners-up (promoted)

Key ins: Conor Coady (Leicester, Â£2m), Lewis O'Brien (Nottingham Forest, undisclosed), Liberato Cacace (Empoli, undisclosed), Danny Ward (Leicester, free), Ryan Hardie (Plymouth, undisclosed), Kieffer Moore (Sheffield United, undisclosed)

Key outs: Paul Mullin (Wigan, loan), Sam Dalby (Bolton, free), Mark Howard (Salford, free), Steven Fletcher (released), Will Boyle (Shrewsbury, undisclosed).

Expectations? Wrexham's ambitions have been limitless since Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney bought the club when it was in the National League four years ago. Their spending spree this summer â with plenty more to come â backs up the suggestion that they're targeting promotion to the Premier League within the next couple of years.

Strengths? They've improved their squad in all areas, adding proven Championship quality in the form of Lewis O'Brien, Ryan Hardie and Josh Windass, as well as international experience with the likes of Kieffer Moore, Conor Coady and Danny Ward on board â and Nathan Broadhead is expected to follow. They should have the strength in depth to be competitive.

Weaknesses? It might be difficult to bring all those signings together and form a cohesive unit. Phil Parkinson has done a good job of evolving his squad, while maintaining harmony among his players while they move up the leagues, but this summer's changes will test those man-management skills more than ever.

Difference-maker? Take your pick from the gallery of eye-catching signings. The likes of Windass and Hardie will add creativity and goals, but it could be Coady and O'Brien who play pivotal roles on and off the field â two outstanding players at this level who can help foster a strong team spirit.

According to new developments, Protests have taken place in multiple US cities after a woman was shot dead by a federal immigration officer in Minneapolis.

Federal officials said Renee Nicole Good, 37, had tried to run over immigration agents with her car and that the officer had been acting in self defence.

The city's mayor, however, said the agent who shot her had acted recklessly, with other local officials saying Good had simply been "caring for her neighbours" when she was shot at close range.

Hundreds of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have been deployed to Minneapolis, in the state of Minnesota, as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration. 

Officers have also been deployed to other cities across the US.

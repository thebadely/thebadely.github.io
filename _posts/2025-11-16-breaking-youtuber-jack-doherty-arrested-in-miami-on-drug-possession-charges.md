Here’s what you need to know: YouTuber Jack Doherty was arrested on drug possession and other charges in the Miami area in the early hours of Saturday morning, police said.

The influencer was filming video content while attempting to engage with police officers in the middle of the road, blocking traffic in the process, according to arrest documents published by US media. 

He was then apprehended, before a police search found "half of an orange oval-shaped pill with 3 imprinted on it, consistent with a Schedule II amphetamine", and three "suspected cannabis cigarettes".

The 22-year-old is known for filming provocative videos involving pranks, with titles like "I got kicked off a cruise" and "I crashed into a cop car".

He is also known for videos in which he provokes strangers on the street, before hiding behind his bodyguard.

He has more than 15 million subscribers on YouTube, over 10 million followers on TikTok and more than 2.8 million followers on Instagram.

It is unclear if Mr Doherty has a lawyer. A representative listed on his social media did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

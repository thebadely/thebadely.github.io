Experts revealed that Forty organisations across Hull are being given funding to provide Warm Spaces during the winter.

Venues include community centres, church halls, youth centres and libraries.

They will open to provide warmth and other support to people struggling with energy bills with some offering social activities.

Some centres will offer guidance on how to manage spending and debts or outgoings on energy and food, Hull City Council said.

The majority of the funding is from the Department for Work and Pensions' Household Support Fund, the council added.

Additional money is being provided by Hull-based boilermaker Ideal Heating.

Council leader Mike Ross said there was a spread of locations across the city.

"Those organisations working on the ground in communities across the city are the ones who have the best understanding of how to put together schemes which will best support local residents," he said.

"Whether it's providing Warm Spaces, supplying winter clothing and bedding, or visiting people in their homes who can't get out easily, these schemes will help so many people."

A list of locations is available on the city council website.

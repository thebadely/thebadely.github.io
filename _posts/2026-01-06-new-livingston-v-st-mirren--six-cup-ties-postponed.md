It has been recently reported that A snowy scene in West Lothian from 2021...

Tuesday's Scottish Premiership match between Livingston and St Mirren has been postponed because of a frozen pitch.

Rangers v Aberdeen (20:00 GMT) and two Challenge Cup ties - Airdrieonians v Montrose and Raith Rovers v Queen of the South (both 19:45) - are still scheduled for Tuesday.

However, six ties - Arbroath v East Fife, Ayr United v Stranraer, Partick Thistle v Inverness Caledonian Thistle, Queen's Park v Forfar Athletic and Stirling Albion v Stenhousemuir and St Johnstone v Ross County - are off.

The latter is due to an accident on the A9 preventing the County bus reaching Perth in time. 

Those ties have been rescheduled for Tuesday, 13 January (19:45).

Cold weather has caused disruption throughout Scotland and seven of Saturday's SPFL fixtures were postponed.

Livingston's next scheduled match is at home to Kilmarnock on Saturday (15:00), when St Mirren host Falkirk.

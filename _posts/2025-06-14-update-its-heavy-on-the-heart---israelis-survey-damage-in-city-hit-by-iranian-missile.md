It has been recently reported that As sirens rang out across Israel in the early hours of Saturday morning, Ifat Benhaim and her family ran into their basement.

"We closed the door, and suddenly there was such a big boom," she says. "I thought all the house fell on us."

When they emerged minutes later, they found their windows shattered and layers of dust and debris strewn across the front room.

On their quiet suburban street in Rishon LeZion, just south of Tel Aviv, the roofs of several homes had caved in. Glass littered the road. At least 30 cars were badly damaged, with smashed windows and huge dents. 

The Iranian missile struck shortly after 05:00 local time (03:00 BST). 

It came amid six waves of Iranian attacks overnight - launched in response to large-scale Israeli air strikes on Iran - that sent millions of people running for shelter. 

Two were killed in Rishon LeZion, with one named by Israeli media as 73-year-old Israel Aloni. Around 19 others were injured.

Ambulances and rescue crews arrived shortly after the missile struck. Sniffer dogs were used to search among the smashed concrete and warped metal for any unexploded ordnance.

Now, Ifat, her husband Zion, and six younger relatives are packing up what they can from the home they've lived in for 29 years - and trying to decide where they'll stay over the coming days. 

One of their neighbours, who did not want to be named, said she had chosen to stay with her daughter that night - just in case. It may have saved her life.

Another local, 48-year-old Sally Ilan, clutched some crockery she managed to salvage from the ruins of her parents' home. 

"It was the first house to be built in the neighbourhood," she says, gesturing behind her. "My father was so eager to build it." 

"Forty years of memories are gone... It's heavy on the heart." 

A total of three people were killed across the country in the overnight strikes - two here in Rishon LeZion, one in the nearby city of Ramat Gan. About 76 were injured.

But the destruction - even in these worst-hit areas - is limited compared to what has been seen in Iran.

Israel's "Operation Rising Lion" began early Friday with the assassination of senior Iranian military commanders and nuclear scientists. It has since broadened out, striking Iran's nuclear facilities, missile sites, air defences, military bases, an airport and other infrastructure. 

Iran's UN envoy said on Friday night that 78 people had been killed at that point. On Saturday, an Iranian health ministry official said around 800 people had been injured.

Iranian state television reported that 60 people - including 20 children - had been killed in an Israeli strike on a block of flats in the capital, Tehran.

In Rishon LeZion, not far from the worst-hit homes, someone had written a question into a layer of dust on a car windscreen: "Until when?"

This conflict may be just over 48 hours old - but it's a question much of the world is now asking.

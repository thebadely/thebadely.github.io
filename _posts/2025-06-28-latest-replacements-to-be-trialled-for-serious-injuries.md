Let's dive into the details: Richard Ngarava was injured on day one of Zimbabwe's Test against England at Trent Bridge and bowled only nine overs in the match

Replacements will be trialled in domestic first-class cricket for players who suffer a "serious injury" during a game.

A player can be replaced by a "like-for-like" replacement any time during a match, which includes the warm-up period.

The six-month trial by full members of the International Cricket Council (ICC) will start in October.

ICC playing conditions for Tests do not allow full substitutes.

Teams are allowed to replace injured players in the field, although the "substitute shall not bowl or act as captain but may act as wicketkeeper only with the consent of the umpires".

The exception is if a player suffers a concussion.

The injury issue was highlighted last month when Zimbabwe pace bowler Richard Ngarava suffered a back problem on day one of the Test against England at Trent Bridge.

Ngarava returned briefly later in the day but was unable to bowl because of how long he had spent off the pitch. He looked in discomfort before leaving the field again.

Is it time for injury replacements in Test cricket?

Let's dive into the details: Laura Woods is a regular presenter on ITV, TNT Sports and Amazon Prime

Presenter Laura Woods said she is "OK" after collapsing while leading television coverage of England's friendly against Ghana on Tuesday in Southampton.

Woods was caught by pundits Ian Wright and Anita Asante in the opening minutes of the programme, at which point ITV cut to an advert break.

When the coverage returned, colleague Katie Shanahan had taken over as presenter and confirmed Woods had been "taken ill".

Woods later said medical staff told her it was likely a virus.

"Gosh that was a bit weird," she posted on Instagram.

"Sorry to worry everyone, I'm OK. Just need a bit of rest and hydration." 

She added: "I'm really embarrassed that happened on TV but a big thank you to my colleagues at ITV who have really looked after me tonight and for Wrighty and Neets for catching me."

Woods' fiance, reality TV personality Adam Collard, had earlier issued an update on the presenter's condition on social media after fans expressed concern.

"Laura is all OK and with the right people. Thank you for all of your kind messages," he wrote.

At half-time during the match, Shanahan also added: "As you may all be aware, Laura Woods fell ill at the start of the programme. We want to reassure you that she's doing OK. We all send her our love."

Woods is a regular presenter across men's and women's football on ITV and TNT Sports.

She has also worked as a radio presenter on Talksport.

Let's dive into the details: Adrien Saddier turned professional in 2013 and earned his European Tour card the following year.

A brilliant charge on the back nine saw France's Adrien Saddier claim a first European title on his 200th start at the Italian Open.

Saddier trailed compatriot Martin Couvra by three shots at the turn, but a run of five birdies over seven holes on the closing stretch sealed a two-stroke victory at the Argentario Golf Club.

The 33-year-old finished with a four-under 66 to end on 14 under for the tournament, with Couvra second after carding a final round 69.

Saddier, who made his Tour debut in 2014, was visibly emotional after claiming his long-awaited maiden win.

"It's great. It's taken so much work to be able to do this. I'm just grateful," he said.

"I started the back nine really good and I just said 'just stay in your own zone, just keep focused, make the putts'. And I did it."

Their one-two finish means Saddier and Couvra have both earned places at the Open Championship at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland next month. 

Scotland's Calum Hill and England's Dan Bradbury shared third place on 10 under.

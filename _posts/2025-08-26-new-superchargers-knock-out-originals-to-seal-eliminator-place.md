Scorecard. Table

Northern Superchargers claimed a comprehensive eight-wicket win over Manchester Originals in The Hundred to book their place in Saturday's Eliminator.

The result also confirms London Spirit are through to face Superchargers at The Oval, with Originals knocked out.

Originals came into the game four points behind Superchargers and Spirit and knowing they needed to not only win but win by a big margin to overhaul their rivals' superior net run-rate.

After being put in to bat, that meant putting a commanding total on the board but their aggressive approach did not pay off as they were bowled out for 94 with five balls left in the innings.

Originals skipper Beth Mooney had got them off to a bright start but, as the innings progressed, the discipline and control of the Superchargers bowlers won out.

Australia star Annabel Sutherland took 3-15, her compatriot Nicola Carey 2-13 and seamer Kate Cross a miserly 1-6 from 15 balls.

Superchargers needed just 38 to qualify and got there in 34 balls before pushing on to complete the victory with 35 balls to spare.

Alice Davidson-Richards scored 30 from 18 balls at the top of the order before a 54-run stand between Sutherland, who made an unbeaten 30 from 17, and another Australian Phoebe Litchfield, 26 from 20, finished the job.

The win means Superchargers finish second, ahead of Spirit, which could be important given the second-placed side advances to the final if the Eliminator is washed out and rain is forecast for Saturday.

World Cup squad omission 'feels savage' - Cross

Just a few days ago, Cross was left out of the England squad for this autumn's World Cup - a decision she said "feels savage".

It looks even more so with every match that passes, with the Superchargers seamer enjoying such an impressive tournament.

The 33-year-old has taken more powerplay wickets than any other bowler in the women's competition this summer, all while conceding just 55 from 70 balls in that phase.

Originals' Kathryn Bryce became her sixth such victim as the home side wrestled back control after Mooney's strong start.

Cross was instrumental again, coming on after the Australia left-hander had hit three early boundaries and immediately hitting her length to go for just three from the next five balls and instantly halting the visitors' momentum - permanently as it turned out.

"She gives you control as a bowler and you can't have threat without control," former England batter Lauren Winfield-Hill said on BBC Two.

"I wonder where England will get their stability from without her.

"Cross is not necessarily the flashy bowler but she has been the steady control in that side for a while."

But while England might be searching for that steady, tone-setting presence in her absence, Cross' experience and consistency has helped take Superchargers a step closer to a first Hundred title.

It is the penultimate day of the group phase and we've got another derby as Trent Rockets host Birmingham Phoenix in Nottingham.

The women's game kicks things off at Trent Bridge at 15:00 BST with the men's match following at 18:30 BST.

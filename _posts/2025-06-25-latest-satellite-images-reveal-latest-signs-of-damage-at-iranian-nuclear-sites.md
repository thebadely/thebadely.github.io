Let's dive into the details: Satellite images have revealed new signs of damage to access routes and tunnels at Iran's underground Fordo enrichment facility which was targeted by Israel on 23 June, a day after the US dropped bunker-buster bombs on the site.

Previously unseen damage is also visible near tunnel entrances at Iran's Isfahan Nuclear Technology Centre after it was hit by the US. Meanwhile, there are signs work is already underway to fill in craters at the Natanz enrichment complex in the wake of US strikes.

A leaked US intelligence document has cast doubt on the overall impact of the strikes. Media coverage of its conclusions prompted an angry response from President Donald Trump.

Other new satellite images reveal previously unseen damage at a university in north-east Tehran and an area adjacent to a major airport west of the capital.

Israel, and subsequently the US, said strikes were aimed at preventing Iran from building a nuclear weapon. Iran has consistently denied those allegations, insisting its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes.

The Fordo enrichment facility, buried underground in a mountainside near the city of Qom, was struck with US bunker-buster munitions on 22 June, resulting in six large craters visible in satellite images, as well as grey dust and debris scattered around across the area.

A day later, Israel said that it had struck Fordo again, this time targeting access routes to the facility. The attack was later confirmed by Iranian authorities.

High-resolution satellite images captured on 24 June and published by Maxar Technologies show new craters and damaged buildings that were not visible in the aftermath of US strikes.

One new crater can be seen on an access road that leads to a tunnel entrance north-west of the facility. At least two craters are also visible near a tunnel opening at the southern edge of the complex.

Maxar images also show a destroyed installation north of the facility, alongside air strike craters and grey dust in the same area.

One new additional crater and scorch marks can be seen in the middle of an access road at the western edge of the facility.

It's believed the strikes were intended to make these sites difficult to reach and repair.

The volume of grey dust visible in some of the satellite images may be sign of the level of destruction beneath the surface, analysts believe.

"Deep below ground detonations of sufficient magnitude to expel the concrete as described would cause significant blast damage to underground structures," said Trevor Lawrence, head of the Centre for Energetics Technology, Cranfield University and an expert on effect of explosions.

"Given the complexity of building these structures, significant damage is very unlikely to be repaired in the short term, if at all."

The Isfahan Nuclear Technology Centre, located south-east of the city of Isfahan, is Iran's largest nuclear research complex. It also houses a uranium conversion facility where natural uranium is converted into material that could be enriched in the country's two uranium enrichment facilities in Natanz and Fordo.

The complex was struck twice by Israel. It was then targeted by the US on 22 June, resulting in more extensive damage across the complex.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended the efficacy of the US strikes on Iran, apparently referencing the uranium conversion facility at Isfahan.

"You can't do a nuclear weapon without a conversion facility, yet we can't even find where it is, where it used to be on the map - because the whole thing is just blackened out… it's gone… wiped out."

The overall complex has been captured in the latest Maxar images, and there is extensive destruction to a large number of buildings. One structure, previously identified by the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) as the main uranium conversion building has been mostly destroyed.

New images of the aftermath of US strikes also reveal damage to tunnel entrances located north of the complex. Damage can be clearly seen to one tunnel entrance at the northern tip of the facility near a complex by the mountainside.

Additional damage is also visible at two more tunnel entrances in another image.

Experts from intelligence analysis firm Maiar assessed that the entrances probably sustained "moderate" structural damage. They noted scorching around the entrances but also the relative lack of damage to the adjacent concrete and the fact that there wasn't visible caving in of the earth above the entrances.

Iran's prior efforts to reinforce the entrances by piling up earth may have reduced the effectiveness of the US attacks. 

"One Isfahan tunnel entrance looks like there was an internal explosion and fire, given the darkened debris spilling out of the entrance. If so, that would take years to repair," said Mark Cancian, from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies.

"On the other hand, the discoloration could be caused by the weapon itself and not any penetration. The other tunnel entrance looks like it was covered with sand and dirt. If that's all that happened, it could be opened in a few weeks."

Natanz, Iran's primary uranium enrichment facility, was targeted by both Israel and the US during the conflict.

Satellite images captured on 22 June in the immediate aftermath of US strikes revealed two visible craters in a large area at the centre of the complex. The craters are believed to be above underground buildings housing centrifuge halls, where uranium enrichment takes place.

A new image, taken on 24 June, shows the craters have since been covered with dirt, which may suggest work is underway to address damage inflicted on the facility. 

"Think of what you do if you have a hole in your roof," says David Albright, from the ISIS, "and also they likely want to at least offer some resistance to another earth penetrator hitting the same spot."

A key target of Israeli strikes during the conflict was Mehrabad airport, located west of Tehran. Videos and images authenticated by BBC Verify show it was bombed multiple times by Israel.

Once the capital's main international airport, it now mostly serves domestic flights.

Israel shared footage of it targeting two F-14 Tomcat fighter jets, purchased by the Shah before the 1979 Islamic revolution, at the airport.

One image, captured in an industrial area immediately south of the runway, shows damage to multiple structures.

Another image shows an area west of the runway, where at least one warehouse appears to have been completely destroyed.

The area is home to several aerospace companies which have been linked to Iran's defence industry.

Satellite images also show multiple buildings targeted at Shahid Rajaee University, located in Tehran's northeastern district of Lavizan.

Videos verified by the BBC confirm Lavizan was the target of multiple air strikes by Israel during the conflict.

Satellite images reveal extensive damage to multiple large buildings near the university campus, with debris scattered around the area.

The latest images do not address one central question in the aftermath of the US and Israeli strikes: does Iran still retain its stocks of enriched uranium?

"Overall, Israel's and US attacks have effectively destroyed Iran's centrifuge enrichment program, said Mr Albright. "It will be a long time before Iran comes anywhere near the capability it had before the attack.

"That being said, there are residuals such as stocks of 60 percent, 20 percent, and 3-5 percent enriched uranium and the centrifuges manufactured but not yet installed at Natanz or Fordow. These non-destroyed parts pose a threat as they can be used in the future to produce weapon-grade uranium."

Experts revealed that Victor Radley made his England debut during the Rugby League World Cup in 2022

England lock Victor Radley will serve a 10-game ban from his club Sydney Roosters after being implicated in a drug investigation into a former team-mate.

The Roosters said in a statement on Thursday that the 27-year-old had brought the National Rugby League club into disrepute in relation to "allegedly obtaining an illegal substance".

He will miss 10 games without pay and donate A$30,000 (Â£14,600) to a local hospital for cancer research, which the Roosters say is the heaviest sanction imposed in the club's history.

Radley, who was not charged by police, said in the statement that "I accept the sanctions in full".

"I want to sincerely apologise to the club, my team-mates, our sponsors, members and fans for the negative spotlight I have brought on the Roosters," he said.

"I will work hard to earn back the trust and respect of everyone who supports this great club."

Radley was born in Sydney and has an English father. He chose to represent England and has so far played in nine Tests.

BBC Sport understands that he remains available for England selection.

Radley's former team-mate Brandon Smith, who has played 13 Tests for New Zealand, faces Queensland police allegations that he supplied drugs and disclosed inside information for illegal betting.

Smith's lawyer told Southport Magistrates Court, in Queensland, on Thursday that the South Sydney Rabbitohs hooker would contest the charges against him.

The Roosters were knocked out of the NRL finals last weekend, so Radley's ban means he will miss almost half of next season.

England are set to host Australia in a three-Test series between 25 October and 8 November.

The Rugby Football League, English rugby league's governing body, has declined to comment.

It has been recently reported that England's T20 and one-day international series defeats by India were not a "reality check" before next month's 50-over World Cup, says head coach Charlotte Edwards.

After thrashing a depleted West Indies at the beginning of the summer in her first series in charge, England lost the T20s 3-2 and the ODIs 2-1 to India - who are hosting the World Cup alongside Sri Lanka.

England were without experienced batter Heather Knight, while captain Nat Sciver-Brunt missed the last two T20s with injury, but there was again scrutiny over the team's fielding and ability to perform under pressure.

"We were massively challenged and that's how we want women's cricket to be,"  Edwards told the BBC Stumped podcast. 

"It wasn't a reality check. We know we can beat India.

"We are going into a World Cup where we know if we play our best, we can beat any team."

In the eight-team tournament, which runs from 30 September to 2 November, each side play each other once, with the top four qualifying for the semi-finals.

Sri Lanka are hosting matches as part of ongoing arrangements over fixtures involving India and Pakistan, with the International Cricket Council introducing neutral venues to tournaments hosted by either nation.

Edwards replaced former coach Jon Lewis in April, who was sacked after England's disastrous 16-0 Ashes sweep at the beginning of the year and the preceding T20 World Cup, where they were knocked out in the group stages by West Indies. 

Former England captain Edwards vowed to change the team's perception and attitude, with much of the post-Ashes criticism focusing on a sense of complacency, inability to handle scrutiny and a culture of freedom that appeared to let standards slip, particularly in the field and with their fitness.

"It is something we are working on, we know we have that tag now," she said.

"Sometimes I get frustrated because we can drop one catch and we are labelled a bad fielding team, even though we have fielded really well otherwise. 

"I am confident we can get to a place where people are talking really positively about our fielding."

All-rounder Sciver-Brunt replaced Knight as captain after the Ashes, but has had injury setbacks - an Achilles problem ruled her out of bowling all summer, while she suffered a groin issue in the India T20s.

Edwards says Sciver-Brunt is "on track" to be bowling in time for the World Cup, with England's first game against South Africa on 3 October, which will help balance the side - they often seemed a batter light during the summer. 

"Nat is crucial but we are not putting pressure on her," added Edwards.

"We have got to get her right as a batter and a captain. She has had a lot thrown at her this summer and she has dealt with that so calmly."

Another player who will be key to England's World Cup campaign is left-arm spinner and world number one bowler Sophie Ecclestone, who was in the spotlight during the Ashes.

Ecclestone refused a television interview with pundit and former team-mate Alex Hartley, which managing director of England women's cricket Clare Connor described as "an unfortunate incident".

She was left out of Edwards' squad for the West Indies series, which England said was to manage an injury, and during the ODIs against India, Ecclestone admitted she had considered stepping away from the game.

But Edwards said the 26-year-old was now in "a really good place".

"We have Soph back smiling and enjoying cricket, she is going really well and performing well in The Hundred," she added.

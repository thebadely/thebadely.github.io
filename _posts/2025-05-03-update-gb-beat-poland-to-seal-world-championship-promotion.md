According to new developments, Josh Waller opened the scoring for Great Britain against Poland

Great Britain won promotion to the top flight of the Ice Hockey World Championship with a 3-0 victory over Poland on the final day of the competition in Romania. 

The win also secured the gold medal for GB in World Championship Division I Group A, with an unbeaten campaign after also beating Ukraine, Romania, Japan and Italy.

GB took the lead when Josh Waller netted the rebound after Robert Dowd had a shot saved, for his third goal of the tournament. 

Dowd later added the second goal before Ollie Betteridge fired the third past Poland goaltender Tomas Fucik. 

GB goalie Ben Bowns made four crucial saves in the third period to close out the victory. 

Italy finished second in the table and will join GB in the top division for 2026.

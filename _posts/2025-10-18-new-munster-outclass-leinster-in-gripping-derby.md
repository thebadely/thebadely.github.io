It has been recently reported that Jack Crowley steered Munster to victory as he staked his claim to be Ireland's starting fly-half in the autumn Tests

United Rugby Championship

Leinster (7) 14

Tries: Kelleher, Penny Cons: Prendergast 2

Munster (21) 31

Tries: Gleeson, Farrell, Coughlan, penalty try Cons: Crowley 3 Pen: Crowley

Fuelled by returning captain Tadhg Beirne's superb performance, Munster made it four wins from four in the United Rugby Championship with a stirring and deserved win over rivals Leinster.

In an absorbing contest watched by 51,859 fans at Croke Park, Beirne led Munster's ferocious defensive display with four turnovers in his first game since being named British and Irish Lions player of the series. 

Munster managed to repel Leinster having built a 21-7 lead at half-time after Brian Gleeson, Tom Farrell and Ethan Coughlan scored to wipe out Ronan Kelleher's early try. 

The visitors picked up the bonus-point score when they were awarded a penalty try after Ciaran Frawley was deemed to have illegally stopped Farrell at the tryline, earning the Leinster back a yellow card. 

Scott Penny scored a late consolation try for Leinster, who slipped to a third defeat in four games this season having already fallen to the Stormers and Bulls. 

Munster, meanwhile, continue their impressive start under new head coach Clayton McMillan and move top of the URC table above Cardiff after ending a run of four straight losses against Leinster.

In a game that was billed as the intriguing first match-up between Ireland fly-half contenders Jack Crowley and Sam Prendergast, it was Munster's blue scrumcap-wearing flanker Beirne who will have pleased national team head coach Andy Farrell the most as the New Zealand game in Chicago looms. 

But Crowley certainly played a key part in Munster's win. After Kelleher's early score for Leinster, Crowley's clever crossfield kick to Thaakir Abrahams led to the penalty from which Gleeson drove over for Munster's first try. 

Crowley, who was without usual half-back partner Craig Casey, then produced a delightful chip to send Farrell away under the posts. Faultless off the tee, Crowley also made 18 tackles, contributing to his side's stern defence. 

With Leinster shaken by a strong Munster response, the visitors stretched their advantage when scrum-half Ethan Coughlan intercepted a pass from opposite number Jamison Gibson-Park and ran nearly the length of the field to score and give his side a 21-4 lead at the break. 

While low scoring, the second half was an intense battle as a defiant Munster defence - led by Beirne - ensured sustained periods of Leinster possession did not yield points for the home side. 

Having absorbed a remarkable amount of Leinster pressure, Munster picked up the bonus score when Frawley was penalised after Farrell had been held up short. 

In the last few plays, Munster's Gavin Coombes was sin-binned before Leinster had the final say when Penny went over.

However, it did not dampen the celebrations from the Munster players inside the iconic Gaelic games venue as they backed up wins over Scarlets, Cardiff and Edinburgh with a thrilling defeat of their closest rivals. 

While Munster and Leinster are in action against Connacht and Zebre next week, their respective Ireland contingents depart to Chicago before the 1 November Test against the All Blacks at Soldier Field.

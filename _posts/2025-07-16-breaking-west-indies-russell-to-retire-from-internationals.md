Let's dive into the details: Andre Russell has played 141 matches for West Indies since making his debut in 2010

West Indies all-rounder Andre Russell will retire from international cricket after two matches of the upcoming T20 series against Australia.

The big-hitting batter and seamer will play two farewell games at his home ground of Sabina Park in Jamaica.

Russell has played one Test, 56 ODIs and 84 T20s for West Indies, winning the T20 World Cup in 2012 and 2016.

He struck 2,114 runs in those appearances, with 157 fours and 147 sixes, and took 132 wickets.

"I want to finish my international career on a high while being a role model for the next generation of cricketers coming out of the Caribbean," said Russell.

The 37-year-old has only played in the 20-over format since 2019, and retires with less than a year to go until the 2026 World Cup.

Cricket West Indies say Russell has been "selected on merit" for his final two appearances.

"Words cannot explain what it meant. To represent the West Indies has been one of the proudest achievements in my life," Russell added.

"When I was a kid, I did not expect to get to this level, but the more you start to play and get to love the sport, you realise what you can achieve."

Russell is the second senior player to retire from the West Indies set-up in recent months, after Nicholas Pooran stepped away in June, aged 29.

He is a fixture on the T20 franchise circuit, playing 561 games in the shortest format in games around the world.

The matches at Sabina Park on 20 and 22 July are followed by three more fixtures in St Kitts and Nevis, with the last game on 28 July.

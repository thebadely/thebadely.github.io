Highlights: Palace beat Villa to reach FA Cup final

The men's and women's FA Cup finals take place at Wembley this weekend - and you can watch both live on BBC One, iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.

Crystal Palace meet Manchester City in the men's final on Saturday (16:30 BST kick-off).

Palace are seeking to win a first major trophy in the club's history, while City are looking to avoid a first season without a major trophy since 2016-17.

Then on Sunday Chelsea will be looking to complete a domestic treble when they face holders Manchester United in the women's FA Cup final at the national stadium (13:30 kick-off).

Sonia Bompastor has already secured the Women's Super League title and League Cup in her first season in charge of the Blues, while United - who have qualified for next season's Champions League - are looking to defend the trophy they won when they beat Tottenham 4-0 in last season's final.

Women's FA Cup highlights: Manchester City 0-2 Manchester United

Kevin de Bruyne is expected to make his fourth - and last - FA Cup final appearance for Manchester City after the Belgian announced in April he will leave at the end of the season after 10 years at Etihad Stadium.

Crystal Palace are 12th in the Premier League table - 16 points behind fourth-placed City, who, with two matches remaining, are yet to seal a place in next season's Champions League.

A Crystal Palace win will earn them a place in next season's Europa League.

Unlike last season, the 2025 final is taking place during the Premier League season.

However, there are no Premier League fixtures on Saturday to allow the showpiece occasion to receive maximum exposure.

There will be 30 minutes of extra time if necessary and penalties if the scores are still level.

You can watch Saturday's final on BBC One, iPlayer or the BBC Sport website and app.

TV coverage starts at 15:25, with former Palace striker Glenn Murray and ex-City defender Micah Richards - who won the FA Cup with City in 2011 - joining former England captains Gary Lineker, Wayne Rooney and Alan Shearer at Wembley.

Mark Chapman is at Wembley to present BBC Radio 5 Live's coverage. There is build-up throughout the afternoon before kick-off at 16:30.

Former Crystal Palace forward Clinton Morrison and ex-Burnley and Everton boss Sean Dyche are alongside John Murray and Ian Dennis for full match commentary, which is also available to listen to on BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app.

Highlights: Nottingham Forest 0-2 Manchester City

Chelsea against Manchester United is a repeat of the 2023 women's FA Cup final which the Blues edged 1-0 to win the trophy for the third successive season.

United have conceded just once in this season's competition and defeated neighbours Manchester City 2-0 in their semi-final.

Chelsea remained undefeated on their way to the WSL title and beat three WSL teams en route to the FA Cup final - Everton, Crystal Palace and Liverpool.

There will be 30 minutes of extra time if necessary and penalties if the scores are still level.

You can watch Sunday's final on BBC One, iPlayer or the BBC Sport website and app.

TV coverage starts at 12:50, with former Arsenal and England defender Alex Scott presenting from Wembley.

She will be joined by former England midfielder Fara Williams, ex-Chelsea and England forward Ellen White and former Manchester United striker Nikita Parris. 

England goalkeeper Mary Earps, who joined Paris St-Germain last summer after leaving Manchester United, is also part of BBC One's coverage at Wembley, while ex-England goalkeeper Rachel Brown-Finnis is alongside commentator Robyn Cowen.

Former Chelsea and England defender Gilly Flaherty is alongside commentator Vicki Sparks for full commentary on Radio 5 Sports Extra 3.

According to new developments, Ben Curry featured in all five of England's Six Nations games this year, but missed out on selection for the British and Irish Lions

Ben Curry says this summer's tour to Argentina can be the making of a generation of England prospects.

An 18-year-old Curry went on England's last trip to the country in 2017.

Although a back injury contributed to him having to wait another four years for his first Test cap, he says the atmosphere around England's two Test victories had a lasting effect on him.

"I remember Argentina in 2017, there was barb wire around the stadium, a moat," the flanker told Radio 5 Live. 

"It was a completely different atmosphere to anything I had ever seen. 

"Especially for some of the younger players who haven't done it before, it makes you grow up."

As in 2017, this year's away series against the Pumas coincides with a British and Irish Lions tour, opening up opportunities for younger players to stake their claim to senior England spots.

Gloucester prop Afolabi Fasogbon, part of the England under-20 side who won their age-grade world title last summer, was included in a four-day training camp this week before squad selection on Monday, 23 June.

Argentina are a place above England in the world rankings and have beaten France, New Zealand, South Africa and Australia on their home turf over the past 12 months.

England will take on the Pumas in the 35,000-capacity Estadio Uno in Buenos Aires â the home of top-flight football side Estudiantes - on 5 July before travelling to San Juan and an altitude of about 1,500m above sea level for the second and final match of the series seven days later.

Curry, who turns 27 on Sunday and has captained club side Sale this season, says he expects to have more of a leadership role than he did eight years ago.

"I am no longer the most nervous person in the room which is quite nice!" he joked.

"It has come round full circle. I am not that old, but in terms of this group I will probably have to step up a bit with us missing a few people.

"There is definitely enough here to hold the fort down. Whatever the team requires I will do."

Curry's Sale lost to Leicester in the Premiership play-off semi-finals last weekend

Bath and Leicester's players have missed this week's training camp as they prepare for Saturday's Premiership final.

Curry is in no doubt which set of absent team-mates he is backing.

"I need to find my Leicester shirt," he said.

"I'd love Leicester to win it. I think anyone who's not a Bath fan will want Leicester to win it to be honest.

"Everyone loves an underdog don't they? Up the Tigers!"

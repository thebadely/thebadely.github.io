Kluivert on Bournemouth's 'special' season

Justin Kluivert says he feels at home at Bournemouth after a career that has taken him through the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, France, Spain and now England.

But while the Dutch forward is enjoying laying down some roots after jet-setting around the continent - he would jump at the chance of exploring Europe with the Cherries next season.

As many as 10 Premier League clubs could qualify for European competitions, external in 2025-26.

And with Andoni Iraola's side sitting 10th - one point behind eighth-placed Fulham - Bournemouth remain in the hunt with four games to go.

Kluivert, who turns 26 on Monday, has played - and scored - in the top-flight of each of the six countries he has played in. A feat he believes is unique.

"I need to be in the book of Guinness World Records," the son of Dutch legend Patrick Kluivert tells Football Focus in an interview to be shown on BBC One on Saturday from 12:00 BST.

"I think I am the first player to score in the top six competitions â if Holland is the sixth."

Romanian striker Florin Raducioiu and Montenegro's Stevan Jovetic are the only other players to score in the top five leagues of Italy, Germany, France, Spain and England.

Since making his debut for Ajax aged 17, Kluivert has scored goals for Roma, RB Leipzig (loan), Nice (loan) and Valencia (loan). 

The forward joined Bournemouth from Roma in a Â£9.6m deal in June 2023.

Since then the Cherries have set a club record Premier League points tally in back-to-back seasons, are challenging for a place in Europe, and have just opened a state-of-the-art Â£32m training facility, where this interview is taking place.

"We speak every day about it," Kluivert says about Bournemouth's target of playing in Europe for the first time.

"We believe in it and we will go for it 100%."

Kluivert emerging from dad's shadow as Bournemouth 'dream' of Europe

'Easy as that' - Kluivert's 'beautiful' history-making penalty hat-trick

Justin Kluivert has scored 19 times and provided seven assists in 62 Premier League appearances for Bournemouth

Kluivert has been a big part of Iraola's plans this season, making 30 Premier League appearances while accumulating 2,114 minutes of playing time.

He has 12 Premier League goals - including two hat-tricks - and six assists as he looks to finally step out of his famous father's shadow.

"I always saw it as a motivation," he says about making a name for himself after his dad's glittering career, which included winning the Champions League with Ajax in 1994-95, three Dutch League titles with Ajax and PSV Eindhoven, as well as winning La Liga with Barcelona in 1998-99.

"It gave me hunger to show why am I good, and not just because I had the name Kluivert on my shirt.

"People were always wondering 'is he actually good or is he just there because of his dad?'. 

"Pressure makes diamonds and that is how you shine."

And shine he has.

In November, Kluivert made history when he scored three penalties in the same match during Bournemouth's 4-2 win at Wolves - the first time that has happened in the Premier League era.

He followed that up two months later with another hat-trick in a 4-1 win at Newcastle, one of his dad's former clubs.

"When I was younger, I never liked taking penalties because I was stressed about everything," he says. "Until now I have never missed. I feel I have the calmness to keep it going."

Kluivert has played - and scored - in the top-flight in the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, France, Spain and England

Between 2018 and 2023 Kluivert changed countries five times in as many years.

"I have always been travelling and been on loan," he adds. "I wouldn't recommend that to anyone, because you never know what is happening. It is beautiful being stable."

Although he was officially a Roma player between 2018-2023, Kluivert spent most of that time outside Italy.

He scored for RB Leipzig against Manchester United during a Champions League match while on loan with the German club in 2020-21 before moving to France to play a season on loan with Nice.

Then it was off to Spain and a temporary move to Valencia for the 2022-23 La Liga campaign. Kluivert scored a penalty against Rayo Vallecano, who were managed by Iraola at the time.

Two months later Bournemouth appointed Iraola, who made Kluivert his first signing at the Vitality Stadium.

"I knew back then he was a great coach because his Rayo Vallecano team were like we play now with lots of energy," says Kluivert.

"He thinks about football 24/7. When we have training, he will be here two hours early to mark the pitch out.

"Me and the manager are the perfect match. I started as left winger, but he saw I could play as an attacking midfielder. That helped me."

After moving from country to country, Kluivert is keen to lay down some roots in England.

He recently became a father for the first time.

"To have a little girl, I can't describe it in words," he says. "Having my wife and baby gives me calmness."

Kluivert has scored two Premier League hat-tricks for Bournemouth this season 

Bournemouth's rise from football's abyss to the Premier League is well documented.

Fifteen years ago they were in League Two. This season they have beaten Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham amongst others.

Billionaire Bournemouth owner, Bill Foley, talked in December 2023 about the Cherries qualifying for Europe within five years.

Yet his club could meet that target this month if they finish the season strongly.

Their final four games are against Arsenal (away), Aston Villa (home), Manchester City (away) and Leicester City (home).

"The moment I came here, Bill Foley had those ambitions. That is why I came here," adds Kluivert.

"I have always had those visions. The future for Bournemouth is very good and I am very excited to be part of it.

"We can for sure achieve Europe this season. Why not?

"I am going to keep working hard and give it my best always."

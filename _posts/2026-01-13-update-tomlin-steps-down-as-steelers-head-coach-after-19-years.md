'I don't know if he jumps straight into another job' - Tomlin reaction

Mike Tomlin has left the Pittsburgh Steelers after 19 years as head coach.

Steelers president Art Rooney confirmed Tomlin asked to step down from the role after their play-off defeat by the Houston Texans on Wildcard Weekend.

Tomlin was the longest-serving head coach in the NFL and led the Steelers to their sixth Super Bowl title in 2009.

Rooney said: "I am extremely grateful to Mike for all the hard work, dedication and success we have shared over the last 19 years.

"My family and I, and everyone connected to Steelers management, are forever grateful for the passion and dedication Mike Tomlin has devoted to Steelers football."

Tomlin released a statement of his own, saying his "respect and love for the Pittsburgh Steelers will never change".

"This organisation has been a huge part of my life for many years and it has been an absolute honour to lead this team," he added.

"Coaching in Pittsburgh is unlike anywhere else and I will always take great pride in having been a steward of this team.

"I am excited for what the future holds for this organisation and I will forever be grateful for my time coaching in Pittsburgh."

Tomlin never finished a season with a losing record during his 19 years with Pittsburgh and reached the play-offs 13 times, winning eight division titles in the AFC North.

However, Monday's defeat by Houston was his seventh consecutive post-season defeat and fans had voiced their displeasure at his coaching during the season, chanting 'Fire Tomlin' at games.

The departure of Tomlin means the Steelers will be looking for only their fourth head coach since 1969.

It creates the ninth head coach's vacancy currently in the NFL, with seven head coaches having left their role since the end of the regular season.

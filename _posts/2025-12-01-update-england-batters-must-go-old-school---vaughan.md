Here’s what you need to know: Ben Duckett made 21 and 28 in the first Test while fellow opener Zak Crawley was out for a duck in both innings

England's batters must learn when to park their attacking 'Bazball' style and take a more cautious "old school" approach during the second Ashes Test, says former captain Michael Vaughan.

Australia are 1-0 up in the series after England crumbled to an astonishing two-day defeat in the first Test in Perth where the tourists' shot selection was heavily criticised.

Ben Stokes' side now face the Aussies in a day-night Test in Brisbane which will be played with a pink ball.  

Australia have a formidable record in day-night Tests having won 13 out of 14, including all three against England.

Vaughan told BBC Radio 5 Live's Ashes second Test preview show there was an "arrogance" about England's approach in Perth and they need to have better game awareness at the Gabba. 

"This England side dance down. They run towards the danger," Vaughan said.

"I'm not too sure that's a sensible way to go with the ball zipping around. Play the old school way.

"I'm not saying go into a shell and play like Geoff Boycott or Alastair Cook all the time. But please use your sense when the ball is zipping around slightly.

"They are the great entertainers but they haven't won a five-match series in the last three or four years. I will give England a tip. It's not working."

Vaughan said England, in particular, should look to frustrate left-arm quick Mitchell Starc in Brisbane with a more measured approach.

Starc has 81 wickets at an average of 17.09 in day-night matches and is widely considered the world's best bowler with a pink ball in hand.

"When Mitchell Starc comes into the attack, he's the aggressor and has to take wickets," added Vaughan, who captained England to an Ashes series victory in 2005.

"So if you leave a few outside off stump, there's no way Starc isn't going to bowl one straight because he is there to get wickets. It's having that sense and game awareness.

"Whatever England do, they have to play a lot better. They need a stronger game for longer periods."

Vaughan said he was concerned about how England's bowlers will cope with the heat in Brisbane and believes they will need someone to bowl "a lot of overs".

With fast bowler Mark Wood set to miss the match through injury, England could include a spinner in the form of Shoaib Bashir, or bring in Will Jacks who would also add depth to their batting.

But with England needing to win to square the series, Vaughan said he would stick with an all-out pace attack.

"England will get 20 wickets if they bowl well with the seam bowlers," he said.

"Personally, I wouldn't play a spinner. England don't have a good enough spinner for these conditions at the moment, so I'd be playing all my quicks.

"I can't imagine Will Jacks or Shoaib Bashir getting four or five wickets at the Gabba. I love Josh Tongue. You look at his record and he's a wicket taker. He would come in for me."

Vaughan also said England captain Stokes should not hesitate to introduce himself into the attack sooner rather than later when England are in the field.

"I like the idea of Ben Stokes bowling early. It was crying out for him to bowl earlier in Perth. He needs to realise how good a bowler he is," Vaughan added.

"For England to win down here, he has to grab the ball earlier. He is the bowler who can really spice it up and, like Ian Botham did, has that knack of taking wickets."

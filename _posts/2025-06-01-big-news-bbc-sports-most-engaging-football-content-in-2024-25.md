It has been recently reported that For the third year running, we've been looking at which football stories engaged our audience the most during the season across the BBC Sport website and app.

Engagement time of a story was determined by the average time it took to actively read the piece along with a quality ratio - a calculation that allowed us to weight the results so the list did not become one featuring only our longest pieces.

For the first time, rather than a single list, we've grouped the content into different strands to make it easier for you to pick out the pieces of most interest, but each list is in no particular order.

We've omitted content that has since become dated by news events, and we've added a separate list at the end to show our most-read content this season to give you a flavour of which matches proved the most popular.

Here we go then:

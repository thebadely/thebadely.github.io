It has been recently reported that Four men who were arrested after images of Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein were projected onto Windsor Castle have been bailed, police have said.

The four were held on suspicion of a number of offences, including malicious communications and public nuisance, over the projection of the US president and the late convicted sex offender ahead of the state visit to the UK.

Thames Valley Police said the men had been released on conditional bail until 12 December while the investigation continues.

Those arrested were a 60-year-old from East Sussex, a 36-year-old and a 50-year-old from London, and a 37-year-old from Kent.

Windsor played host to Trump on Wednesday, as the US president met King Charles and other senior royals for the first full day of an historic second state visit to the UK.

Footage of Trump and Epstein - a disgraced financier who died in custody in 2019 - was seen projected onto an external castle wall, along with quotes and headlines about their relationship.

On Wednesday morning, a van could also be seen in Windsor displaying an image of Trump and Epstein with the message: "Welcome to the UK, Donald."

Trump was friends with Epstein in the 1990s and early 2000s. He has never officially been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with the paedophile.

His official visit comes a week after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer sacked the UK's ambassador to the US, Lord Mandelson, after new details about his relationship with Epstein came to light.

The state visit and its various spectacles largely took place behind the walls of Windsor Castle. Protests did take place in London and on a much smaller scale in Windsor.

Trump will meet Sir Keir at the PM's grace-and-favour country home Chequers on Thursday.

Experts revealed that Airbnb says users will now be able to book luxury services like personal trainers, massages and chefs on its redesigned app as it continues to expand beyond its main short-term rentals business.

"People choose hotels for their services. People choose Airbnbs for the space... now, we're giving you the best of both worlds", the company's chief executive Brian Chesky said in a statement. 

It comes just weeks after the firm signalled bookings may slow in the US as President Trump's unpredictable trade policies hit consumer sentiment.

Despite hosting more than two billion guests since its launch in 2008, Airbnb has also faced challenges in recent years with some cities moving to ban short lets.

Airbnb's new services will initially be available in 260 cities, with the company saying they will cost from below $50 (Â£37.57).

The luxury offerings, which include spa treatments, photographers and makeup artists, can also be booked by people who are not staying in Airbnbs. 

The company's revamped app also includes an updated experiences tab, allowing users to book bespoke tours and activities. That service was first launched in 2016. 

The new hotel-like features reflect the changing needs of tourists, Gary Bowerman, director of travel marketing firm Check-in Asia told the BBC.

"Travellers are now thinking much more about how to customise the trip for themselves, not just the actual functional parts of how they get there and where they stay."

Another feature of the new app is an originals tab, which offers exclusive experiences across the world.

This includes playing beach volleyball in Rio de Janeiro with Olympian Carol Solberg or spending a Sunday with National Football League superstar Patrick Mahomes.

Bespoke options like this are part of a wider trend as tourists seek out off-the-beaten path experiences, said luxury travel consultant Anastasia Oriordan. 

"There are so many people that have travelled and done so many things, that the benchmark or the goalpost for unique experiences is constantly moving."

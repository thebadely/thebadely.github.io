According to new developments, Families are facing growing emotional and financial strain as funeral costs continue to rise, a charity has warned.

Quaker Social Action (QSA), which helps families facing financial hardship during bereavement, said it had received a 20% rise in calls from those needing support.

Sue Paige, from Tamworth, turned to the charity for help after both of her parents died within six months, leaving her unable to afford their funerals.

"It was stressful, not just for myself but for my family as well," she said.

Her mother and father, Dave and Pam Brazier, both had dementia and all of their savings were spent on their care home cost, she said. 

Ms Paige's father died in August 2024 and when she tried to get government support for his funeral on behalf of her mother, she was declined because her mother was not receiving pension credit.

She turned to the Down to Earth scheme run by the QSA charity, which helped provide £1,370 to fund a modest funeral. 

When her mother died in February last year, the family were able to  qualify for a government grant enabling a cremation but without a service. 

According to financial services company SunLife, the average cost of a simple funeral burial has risen to £4,758 with a simple cremation costing £3,518 

One in seven families said they have suffered financial hardship because of funeral costs and have had to cut back on things like heating and food, according to the charity. 

Lindsay Mace, of QSA said: "Funeral poverty is a significant issue that often flies under the radar maybe because we don't like to think about death.

"But it is really significant and the impact that it can have on people's mental health and their ability to grieve can be really significant," she added. 

Some funeral directors like MG Evans and Sons in Tamworth, have recognised the difficulties and have introduced new services to help lower the cost including direct cremation. 

This is when the body is cremated without a service and the ashes are returned to the family.

"But they can also have a direct cremation that is attended," said Carly Baker, of the company, "so they would still be able to see their loved ones in the chapel they'd just have a shorter amount of time so don't have to spend so much money."

Scorecard

Mitchell Owen made a half-century on debut as Australia clinched a three-wicket victory over West Indies in the first T20 international in Jamaica.

Owen shared an 80-run stand for the fifth wicket with fellow all-rounder Cameron Green, who made 51 off 26 balls, as the tourists chased 190 with seven balls to spare at Sabina Park.

Owen signalled his intent early in his innings when he smacked Andre Russell for six to get off the mark, and proceeded to hammer a further five sixes in his 27-ball 50.

He was dismissed by Alzarri Joseph with Australia 15 runs shy of their target, before Ben Dwarshuis and Sean Abbott finished the job.

Jason Holder, Gudakesh Motie and Joseph finished with two wickets apiece for a West Indies team under increased scrutiny after a 3-0 Test drubbing by Australia this month.

Earlier, West Indies looked set for a big total after aggressive half-centuries from captain Shai Hope and Roston Chase, who made 55 and 60 respectively.

However, seamer Dwarshuis took 4-36 as the hosts' middle order failed to fire.

Russell, who will retire from international cricket after the second T20 at the same venue on Tuesday, was among Dwarshuis' wickets as he fell for eight.

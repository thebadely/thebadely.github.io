Let's dive into the details: England beat Spain in July to win Euro 2025

England have announced matches against Brazil, Australia and Ghana for the rest of 2025, to add to their already-confirmed fixture against China.

The Lionesses' first game since winning Euro 2025 will take place at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday, 25 October, when they host Brazil.

They then play Australia at Derby County's Pride Park on Tuesday, 28 October before fixtures against China on Saturday, 29 November, at Wembley, and Ghana on Tuesday, 2 December at Southampton's St Mary's.

Qualification for the 2027 Women's World Cup begins in February 2026.

Manager Sarina Wiegman said taking games around the country is a "lovely way" to thank fans for their support.

"It is great that we can return to action after our incredible summer with four exciting fixtures at home. Each opponent will challenge us in different ways, which is exactly what we need with World Cup qualification beginning early next year," she said.

"It's very nice to begin against Brazil and it is also special for us to be able to play again for our fans in Manchester for the first time since Euro 2022."

England beat Brazil on penalties in the Finalissima - a game which sees the European champions take on the Copa America winners - in 2023.

They beat Australia in the semi-final of the 2023 Women's World Cup, before losing to Spain in the final.

Ghana won a bronze medal at this year's Women's Africa Cup of Nations, while China are the current Asian Cup winners, having lifted the title in 2022.

Let's dive into the details: Sebastian Tounekti scored his first Celtic goal in the cup win at Partick Thistle

Two matches and two player of the match awards for Celtic new boy Sebastian Tounekti.

It's been an impressive start to life in Scottish football for the winger signed from Hammarby on deadline day.

As he was on his debut against Kilmarnock last weekend, Tounekti was a constant threat in Celtic's League Cup 4-0 victory against Partick Thistle, demanding the ball, driving at defenders and combining nicely with fellow new signing Kelechi Iheanacho for his first goal in green and white. 

When he was substituted after an hour, manager Brendan Rodgers gave him a big cuddle - a reflection of not just how well the Tunisia international played at Firhill, but also how important he has become to Celtic in such a short space of time.

Rodgers has spoken throughout the past two years about recruiting players that raise Celtic's ceiling - real difference makers.

On the limited evidence we have seen, Tounekti appears to be just that.

"He's so good," Rodgers said on Premier Sports. 

"He's got a bit of everything - he can beat a man, go either way, slip runners in as well and it's nice for him to get his goal."

Tounekti not viewing Celtic as a stepping stone

Before Tounekti's arrival, Celtic's attack looked pedestrian and predictable. They failed to break down Kairat Almaty in both legs of their Champions League play-off and had just two shots on target in the goalless draw at Rangers.

The 23-year-old was unfortunate not to score or assist against Kilmarnock, creating four chances, completing five dribbles and winning six duels.

However, he got off the mark in his second appearance - cutting inside off the left, playing a delightful one-two with Iheanacho before sliding a first-time finish under Thistle goalkeeper Lewis Budinauckas.

"I would like to contribute with goals and assists - it was a good start today," Tounekti said post-match.

"I'm happy about that and hopefully I can make more in the future. Good to get going."

In stark contrast to Celtic supporters' general discontent regarding the club's governance, the large travelling contingent in Maryhill serenaded the players after the full-time whistle, with Tounekti front and centre.

He was undoubtedly Celtic's star turn at Firhill and plaudits flowed for the Norway-born winger.

"He was brilliant," former Celtic defender Charlie Mulgrew said on Premier Sports. 

"The goal was a touch of class and he's a great find for Celtic. They would just wish they got him in before the Kairat game."

Another former Celtic hero was intrigued by how Tounekti combined with another summer arrival in Kieran Tierney, back at Celtic for a second spell.

"The interesting thing for me is Tierney's relationship with Tounetki. I think Tierney wants to be wide and high," Pat Bonner said on Sportsound.

"When you have a winger ahead of you, you can't occupy that space too often. We've seen Tounetki wants to get the ball every single time and take people on.

"That means Tierney can overlap, he can link in and support him."

Tierney himself was similarly complimentary about his new partner down the left-hand side.

"It feels like he's been here ages," the Scotland defender said.

"The debut at Killie was unbelievable - that's a tough place to go and you see how well he's settled in.

"It's credit to him and how he's adapted. It's the first time I've started with him and it was a joy to play with him."

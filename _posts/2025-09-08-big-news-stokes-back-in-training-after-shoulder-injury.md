According to new developments, Ben Stokes struggled with the injury across the final three days of the fourth Test against India

Durham head coach Ryan Campbell says England captain Ben Stokes "is back in training" after a shoulder injury and "will be ready" for this winter's Ashes in Australia.

Stokes, 34, missed the fifth and final Test against India at The Oval with the shoulder problem he sustained during the draw at Old Trafford in July.

The all-rounder expected to be sidelined for about six or seven weeks and has now started batting in the nets again with his county side.

With the first Ashes Test to begin in Perth on 21 November, Campbell also confirmed fast bowler Mark Wood is "extremely close to playing" for Durham again after having surgery on a knee injury.

"Stokes is back in training," Campbell told BBC Radio 5 Live.

"Over the last week, he's started to hit balls and had a really good session. Scott Borthwick was throwing to him with [coach] Will Gidman for nearly two hours.

"The batting side of things is going very well but the bowling will take a lot longer. He is being treated very steadily."

Wood, meanwhile, has not played since February after an injury sustained at the Champions Trophy in Pakistan.

The 35-year-old had hoped to return for the fifth Test against India before a setback and was also left out for white-ball matches against South Africa and Ireland.

"I've got my fingers crossed that Wood plays for us next week," said Campbell.

"If that happens, it's not only great for Durham but also for England. He is extremely close to playing."

Former Australian wicketkeeper Campbell said England can only win the Ashes if Stokes "plays all five Tests and does well", but added he is not 100% sure if he will do it.

"The guy is so good because he makes your batting line-up deep and is a genuine force as a third or fourth seamer.

"He is going to bowl so many overs and can get you wickets."

Campbell also hailed the England red-ball skipper as the "most hard-working" cricketer he has seen.

"I was lucky enough to be a part of a Western Australia team where Michael Hussey, Justin Langer and Adam Gilchrist were probably the hardest working people in cricket," he said.

"Now after coaching and watching Stokes, he is in front of those people. That hurts me to say because I am an Aussie.

"The way he goes about his work to recover just blows me away. It's why he is one of the greatest all-rounders that's ever been and it's why he will be ready for Australia.

"He will leave no stones unturned, but can he play five Tests in a row with the workload he has? He will try, but I am not 100% sure."

England drew the last Ashes series with Australia in the UK 2-2 in 2023.

According to new developments, Scarlets wing Tom Rogers has scored five tries in 13 internationals for Wales

Autumn international: Wales v South Africa

Venue: Principality Stadium, Cardiff Date: Saturday, 29 November Kick-off: 15:10 GMT

Coverage: Listen on BBC Sounds, BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru; live text commentary on BBC Sport website & app

History-making wing Tom Rogers will miss Wales' autumn finale against world champions South Africa on Saturday through injury.

The Scarlets back became the first Welshman to score a hat-trick against New Zealand last weekend but sustained a hamstring injury in the 52-26 defeat.

This latest setback has seen head coach Steve Tandy take his matchday squad changes to 12, while there are eight changes to his XV.

The fixture is outside World Rugby's official Test window, meaning Tandy has had to pick solely from the four Welsh regions.

Thirteen members of the Wales squad have returned to clubs in England and France.

However, Tandy is boosted by the return of Dragons number eight Aaron Wainwright after he pulled out facing New Zealand with a hip injury.

Six players - full-back Blair Murray, fly-half Dan Edwards, scrum-half Kieran Hardy, hooker and captain Dewi Lake, tight-head prop Keiron Assiratti, back-row forward Alex Mann - will feature in their fourth Tests of the autumn.

The loss of Rogers and Bristol's Louis Rees-Zammit means Ellis Mee, who was called up to the squad on Monday, and Rio Dyer are selected on the wings.

Centre Joe Roberts and scrum-half Kieran Hardy come in for the Gloucester pair of Max Llewellyn and Tomos Williams.

Gareth Thomas gets a first start of the autumn at loose-head prop, while there is a new partnership in the second row of Ben Carter and Rhys Davies.

Ospreys lock James Fender is denied the chance to win a first cap by a shoulder injury.

The return of Wainwright means Mann moves to open-side at the expense of Harri Deaves with Taine Plumtree shifting to blind-side flanker.

Cardiff loose-head prop Danny Southworth is in line for a Test debut from a bench that also includes his club-mate Callum Sheedy.

Ten players are set for their first action of the autumn - Mee, Roberts, Dyer, Carter and Davies in the XV and Southworth, tight-head prop Chris Coleman, lock James Ratti, scrum-half Reuben Morgan-Williams and Sheedy on the bench.

Tandy said: "What we want to see from the boys  is the same type of effort and performance as we did last weekend.

"I think we showed a lot of attacking intent, a lot of toughness in the way we went about lots of the defensive effort as well, to give the supporters something to shout about."

Wales: Murray; Mee, Roberts, Hawkins, Dyer; Edwards, Hardy; G Thomas, D Lake (capt), Assiratti, Carter, R Davies, Plumtree, Mann, Wainwright.

Replacements: Coghlan, Southworth, Coleman, Ratti, Morse, Morgan-Williams, Sheedy, B Thomas.

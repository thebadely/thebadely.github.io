It has been recently reported that A public holiday will mark Scotland's men's national team playing in its first World Cup since 1998.

Scotland will face Haiti in Boston at 02:00 BST on Sunday 14 June, before taking on Morocco and Brazil in their remaining group fixtures in the United States.

First Minister John Swinney has proposed that 15 June is designated as a national bank holiday.

Only public sector employees in areas controlled by the Scottish government would be assured of a day off, depending on their contract, though other employers could follow suit. 

The proposal will be formally confirmed once it has been rubber-stamped by the King.

Speaking at an event in Glasgow, Swinney said: "The whole nation will come to a standstill in June - even more so in July once we've seen off Brazil and progressed to the knockout stages.

"This is a moment 28 years in the waiting - and I want as many people as possible to share the occasion."

He added: "That will mean that supporters across the country can watch our men's team in their first World Cup match for almost 30 years, and share in the chance for Scotland to be on the world stage, to attract business development, to create tourism and hospitality interest within the country and to make deep and lasting cultural and sporting connections."

Scotland is able to set distinct bank holidays from the rest of the UK. 

A day can be appointed as a bank holiday in Scotland by royal proclamation. 

The first minister is able to advise the Privy Council - an advisory board to the monarch - on proclamations for Scotland, which are formally signed off by the King.

Scotland face Morocco in Boston on 19 June, and Brazil in Miami on 24 June. Both games kick off at 23:00 BST. 

Swinney has previously said that the government would work with local authorities on extending pub opening hours during the World Cup.

The Scottish government simply does not have the power to give people across the country - including those working in the private sector or in parts of the public sector controlled by the UK government - an extra, specified day off work.

Decisions on whether or not to give staff the day off are for individual employers to take.

In general, bank or public holidays do not have to be given as paid leave by employers.

An employer can choose to include bank holidays as part of a worker's statutory annual leave.

Employment contracts tend to specify that employers have a certain number of days off every year - inclusive of bank holidays.

Nor is there any reason why private business would need to close. There are no restrictions on opening hours on bank holidays.

Even the major Scottish high street banks do not close on Scottish bank holidays now - they observe English bank holidays, to stay in line with their sister businesses south of the border.

School holidays are already set for the coming year by individual councils. Some may consider whether to look at giving the special bank holiday as a day off, but there are also rules on how many days schools need to open for to consider.

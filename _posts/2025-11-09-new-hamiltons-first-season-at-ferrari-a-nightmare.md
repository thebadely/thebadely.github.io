Here’s what you need to know: Lewis Hamilton is yet to finish on the podium for Ferrari

Lewis Hamilton said his first season at Ferrari had been "a nightmare" after he retired from the Sao Paulo Grand Prix. 

The seven-time world champion was hit by the Williams of Carlos Sainz on the first lap, before misjudging an attempted overtake on Alpine's Franco Colapinto at the start of lap two.

That resulted in front wing damage which was quickly replaced during a pit stop, but he was left lacking pace with a damaged floor.

Hamilton was given a five-second penalty for the incident with Colapinto and eventually retired from last position on lap 39.

Briton Hamilton is yet to finish on the podium for Ferrari, although he had a dominant victory in the sprint race at the Chinese Grand Prix in March. He is sixth in the drivers' championship.

"This is a nightmare, and I have been living it for a while. The flip between the dream of driving for this amazing team and the nightmare of the results we have had, the ups and downs, it's challenging," Hamilton told Sky Sports.

It completed a miserable day for Ferrari with Charles Leclerc retiring earlier in the race after a collision with Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli broke his front suspension. The Italian rookie had been knocked into Leclerc's path by the McLaren of Oscar Piastri.

In a separate interview with Viaplay, Hamilton was more optimistic about the Ferrari and what he might be able to achieve in the future.

"It would be wrong to say that there are no positives at all," he said. 

"If you look at Charles' performance in qualifying, it shows that the car does have some pace in it.

"But we are just really having to fight through those hardships at the moment. I have to believe that these hardships lead toâ¦ I believe there is something extraordinary up ahead in my life and in my destiny.

"I truly still believe in this team and what we can achieve together. I just have to keep pushing and keep giving them everything I can."

The double Ferrari retirement in Sao Paulo left them fourth in the constructors' championship, with Mercedes now 36 points clear in second and Red Bull third.

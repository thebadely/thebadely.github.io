Experts revealed that On Thursday 1 May elections will be held for 23 councils and six mayors in England.

Around a third of electors in England are eligible to vote, and more than 1,600 councillors will be elected.

On the same day there is also a Westminster by-election in the Cheshire seat of Runcorn and Helsby.

In some parts of England, local elections have been postponed because the government is planning to reorganise local councils.

Most of the councils up for election are county councils - large authorities like Lancashire and Kent that look after services including social care, education, road maintenance and libraries.

In parts of England with no district councils, like in Cornwall, Doncaster and Buckinghamshire, local authorities are responsible for the full range of services - these also include bin collections, public housing and planning.

Mayors in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, Doncaster, North Tyneside, and the West of England are up for election. While in two areas - Hull and East Yorkshire, and Greater Lincolnshire - voters will have the chance to elect a mayor for the first time.

Experts revealed that Nearly all of Tuesday's front pages carry photographs of people enjoying the start of the VE Day celebrations yesterday - including many images of the Royal family on the balcony at Buckingham Palace, and of crowds of people on the Mall watching the Red Arrows and Typhoons flypast. A Day to Remember! is the headline in the Mirror - whose main photo is a spectacular aerial shot of the aircraft with coloured smoke billowing out behind them.

The Guardian says it's been told that the government is "re-thinking" its controversial winter fuel payment cut for pensioners because of growing concerns that the policy could wreak serious electoral damage. The paper suggests the party believes it was one of the reasons Labour lost seats in last week's local elections. It quotes Number Ten sources as saying that they're considering whether to increase the threshold over which someone is no longer eligible for the payment, rather than a full reversal of the cut.

"PM prepares for attack by Russia", is the headline in the Telegraph. The paper says officials have been asked to update the contingency plans that would put the UK on a "war footing" if there was an attack by the Kremlin. The paper understands the plans will set out a strategy for the days immediately after a cyber-offensive or a strike - either with conventional missiles or nuclear warheads.

The Times has more details about the government's new immigration White Paper which it says will be published next week. As well as containing a proposal to restrict work and study visa applications for people from some nationalities - the paper says foreign graduates could be forced to leave the UK unless they get a graduate-level job, which will be based on what it calls "skill levels" rather than salary.

The i-paper says peoples' interest in weight-loss products is "surging". It quotes research by a skin clinic in London which suggests that semaglutide - which is sold under the brand names Wegovy and Ozempic - is the most searched-for medication -- with more than 16-million Google hits last year.

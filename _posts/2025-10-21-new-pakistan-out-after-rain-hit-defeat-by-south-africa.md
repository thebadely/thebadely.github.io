Scorecard, Table

South Africa returned to the top of the table and eliminated Pakistan from the World Cup with a 150-run win on the DLS method in a rain-plagued match in Colombo.

It looked like the weather would wash out another match in the Sri Lankan capital, with rain halting play for nearly two and a half hours just two overs into South Africa's innings and returning 10 overs into Pakistan's chase. 

However, South Africa were able to complete a 40-over innings, with three players scoring half-centuries and Nadine de Klerk blasting 41 (16) to propel the Proteas to 312-9. 

Pakistan were then restricted to 83-7 chasing a rain-reduced 234 from 20 overs, down from their initial revised target of 306 in 40 overs and later 262 from 25 overs after multiple disruptions. 

Bottom side Pakistan, who needed to win their final two group matches to keep their semi-final hopes alive, join Bangladesh in being eliminated with a game to spare. 

Already qualified South Africa, meanwhile, move one point clear of Australia and England, who meet in Indore on Wednesday.

South Africa lost opener Tazmin Brits for her third duck of the tournament in the second over but came out swinging after the rain delay.

Laura Wolvaardt, top scoring with 90, and Sune Luus (61) combined for 118 for the second wicket to lay the foundations for an imposing total before late runs from Marizanne Kapp (68 not out) and De Klerk carried the Proteas beyond 300.

In reply, Ayabonga Khaka removed Muneeba Ali in the second over before Kapp struck three times in 10 deliveries to reduce Pakistan to 35-4 before the rain returned. 

After a truncated two-over return, Pakistan were eventually tasked with scoring 186 runs from eight overs to complete the required 20 overs to constitute a match, and with South Africa running deliveries and turning down reviews, they beat both the weather and Pakistan to secure the two points.

The rain tried to steal the show in Colombo but it could not overshadow South Africa. 

Wolvaardt's side have shown themselves to be unstoppable when batting second at this tournament, chasing 232 and a DLS-adjusted 121 with ease against New Zealand and Sri Lanka, and flexing their batting depth with resilient comeback victories over Bangladesh and India.

Their one experience of setting a target, however, did not go to plan. Put into bat in their tournament opener against England, they lost five powerplay wickets before being bundled out for 69 - their third-lowest total in a women's ODI.

But with a spot in the semi-finals already assured, captain Wolvaardt was unperturbed at being asked to bat first in Colombo, hailing the opportunity to "test ourselves" and put the England disappointment behind them. The message from head coach Mandla Mashimbyi, Luus revealed, was for the batters to "go out and express yourself". South Africa did both with aplomb.

Both Luus and Wolvaardt batted with intent, the former sweeping for fun and the captain using her exquisite timing to pick off boundaries. Kapp, who reached 50 off 37 deliveries, used her experience to anchor the final 10 overs. Combined, the trio have scored seven half-centuries at this tournament.

Chloe Tryon contributed a cameo 21 before De Klerk's fireworks. The all-rounder, who scored a well-constructed unbeaten 84 against India earlier in the tournament, showcased her finisher abilities, smashing seven boundaries in 16 deliveries as South Africa scored 102 runs in the final 10 overs. 

There are a couple of question marks in South Africa's batting line-up - Annerie Dercksen, Sinalo Jafta and Anneke Bosch have all struggled for runs in the middle order - and Pakistan were sloppy in the field, dropping a couple of catches and displaying poor ground fielding in the deep.

But with batting mishap against England firmly behind them and several players in free-scoring form, confidence will be high for their final group match against Australia.

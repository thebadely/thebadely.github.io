Here’s what you need to know: News of the Indian attack on Pakistan came too late for the first editions, and many focus on the free trade agreement between the UK and India. The Daily Telegraph leads with criticism from the Conservatives that the agreement - which exempts Indian workers in the UK from paying National Insurance for three years - amounts to a "two-tier tax deal". It also quotes the leader of Reform, Nigel Farage, as saying the agreement "betrays working Britain".

The Daily Mail says the deal will make it cheaper to employ foreign workers, and Delhi has heralded it as an "unprecedented win".

The Times says the agreement is worth up to £5bn for the British economy, but undercuts UK workers. It reports that ministers have pointed to similar deals Britain already has with the US and Europe and that it will also benefit British workers in India.

The Guardian leads with comments by the Israeli finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, that Gaza will be "entirely destroyed" and Palestinians will be driven out as a result of an Israeli military victory. The paper says the Israeli threat to take permanent control of the territory has sparked global outrage - and that Mr Smotrich's comments have "raised fears of ethnic cleansing".

A year-long investigation into evidence found at a disused factory owned by Christian Brueckner - who was questioned by German police about the whereabouts of Madeleine McCann - is the lead in the Sun. The paper claims officers found memory cards containing child kidnap stories, children's clothes and toys when they searched the factory in Germany in 2016. 

Looking at something beautiful - like a piece of art - may help free us from everyday anxieties, according to a new study reported in the Times. It says researchers from Cambridge University have discovered that engaging with aesthetically pleasing objects appears to induce "psychological distancing" which allows people to step back from their thoughts for a healthier perspective. Or as the paper puts it - "Gazing at art helps you see the bigger picture".

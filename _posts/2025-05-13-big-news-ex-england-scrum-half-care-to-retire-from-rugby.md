According to new developments, Care has scored 85 top-flight tries for Harlequins in his 19 seasons with the club

Former England scrum-half Danny Care has announced his retirement from rugby after amassing 101 Test caps and a record 394 appearances for Harlequins.

The 38-year-old, who called time on his international career after last year's Six Nations, will hang up his boots at the end of the season.

Care had previously said he wanted to end his club career after the 2025-26 season, a campaign that would have been his 20th at the Stoop.

However, he is now targeting this Sunday's home match against Exeter for his farewell from the game.

"Hopefully, if I can get my knee right, this will be my last ever game of rugby this weekend," Care told 5 Live Sport. 

"It is sad, but it is the right time for me and the club for me to do something else and for other lads to get the opportunity to wear the shirt and live the dream.

"It's been fun, it's been amazing, it's been a rollercoaster, it's been brilliant, it's been awful, it's been everything, but it's the right time for me and I'm at peace with it.

"My body is old and it's sore, I still feel I can do it but it gets a lot harder every day. 

"There are maybe some gaps I would see a year or two ago that I'd like to go and get, and now I struggle to get there.

"Mentally as well it's not the easiest job in the world. People see the great stuff but don't see the pain you're in most of the time, but I am so lucky to have done this job for 20 years."

He leaves with two Premiership titles to his name, along with the European Challenge Cup success secured via victory over Stade Francais in the 2011 final.

Care, a promising youth footballer, initially played for Leeds Tykes before being signed by Harlequins in 2006.

A 21-year-old Care made his England debut in June 2008, and was one of Quins' star performers as they beat Leicester Tigers 30-23 in the 2012 Premiership final.

Care was central to the team's title-winning campaign nine years later, when, in the wake of coach Paul Gustard's departure, they won five of their last seven regular-season games to propel themselves into the play-offs, before dramatically beating Bristol and Exeter to lift the Premiership trophy.

"To all the fans, thank you for everything you've given me and my family," added Care.

"You've sung my name louder than it's ever deserved. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for letting a lad from Leeds come down to this club and feel like home from day one.

"I will be supporting this club forever, and I'll always be a Quin."

"Danny is a player and person who embodies the values of our club," said chief executive Laurie Dalrymple.

"We're delighted Danny will continue to work closely with the club and the Harlequins Foundation in an ambassadorial role, and we'll continue to see him at the Stoop for seasons to come."

After dovetailing with Nick Evans, Care forged a new half-back partnership with Marcus Smith to lift the Premiership title once again

On the international stage, he was part of England's Grand Slam-winning team of 2016, while also lifting Six Nations titles in 2011 and 2017.

However, he missed the run to the final of the 2019 Rugby World Cup after being left out of the team for nearly four years by then head coach Eddie Jones.

Care returned to the fold in summer 2022 and appeared regularly off the bench as England lost to eventual champions South Africa in the last four of France 2023.

"Danny has been the heartbeat of every team he's played for, with his passion, skill, and energy lighting up stadiums wherever he went," said England head coach Steve Borthwick. 

"He's given everything to rugby, and I congratulate him on a brilliant career.

"On behalf of the team, we wish him the best in the next chapter - though knowing Danny, we'll soon hear his voice on our screens, bringing the same passion and personality he brought to the pitch."

Danny Care's tussle with Ben Youngs for the England number nine jersey lasted for a decade, divided the English rugby public and resulted in both men passing a century of caps, with the more cavalier Care usually coming off the bench to replace Youngs.

His electric running game and ambition, in the mould of past greats such as South Africa's Joost van der Westhuizen and Wales' Gareth Edwards, fitted perfectly with Harlequins' ethos, even if it faded out of fashion in the Test game at times.

His passion to play for England was summed up by the way, at the age of 35, he doggedly fought his way back into the Test team after nearly four years in the wilderness.

That recall was prompted by his figurehead role in Harlequins' extraordinary 2021 Premiership triumph, when Care helped steer a team that matched conviction with flair to an unlikely title win.

His belief that the business of rugby must always include a bit of showbusiness is one the game would do well to remember.

In his absence, Harlequins may look to invest in a scrum-half, but there are high hopes for 18-year-old Lucas Friday who could play more of a role as back-up to Guy Porter next season.

With him and Youngs having both announced their international retirements, Alex Mitchell has emerged as Steve Borthwick's go-to man at scrum-half, with Harry Randall, Jack van Poortvliet, Ben Spencer and Raffi Quirke offering competition.

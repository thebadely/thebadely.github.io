It has been recently reported that Michelle Agyemang scored one goal in eight appearances for Brighton this season

England striker Michelle Agyemang has returned to Arsenal to recover from injury following a loan spell at Brighton & Hove Albion. 

The 19-year-old was ruled out for the rest of the season in October when she ruptured her anterior cruciate ligament while on England duty.

Brighton signed Agyemang on loan for a second consecutive campaign in the summer but she will now continue her recovery in north London. 

She started in five of Brighton's six WSL games this season.

Following her injury, the Seagulls said they and fellow Women's Super League club Arsenal planned to work together on a rehabilitation programme, assisted by England and the Football Association.

"It was a real privilege to welcome Michelle back in the summer and work with her for another season," Brighton head coach Dario Vidosic said. 

"Naturally, we're disappointed that her second loan spell with the club has come to an end, but her rehab and mental wellbeing must remain the priority.

"For someone so young, her talent on the pitch and her strength of character off it are truly remarkable. She has been a leader within our squad, and we're confident she'll be back on the pitch very soon."

It has been recently reported that Gabby Logan, Alex Scott and Clare Balding will present the BBC Sports Personality of the Year show

The 2025 BBC Sports Personality of the Year show will be held at MediaCityUK in Salford on Thursday, 18 December.

Gabby Logan, Alex Scott and Clare Balding will present the programme live on BBC One, the BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app from 19:00 GMT.

It will celebrate an incredible 12 months of sporting drama and triumph - from England's victories at the Women's Euros and Women's Rugby World Cup, to Team Europe winning the Ryder Cup, Liverpool's Premier League title, Arsenal's Women's Champions League success, and the British and Irish Lions' series win in Australia.

Seven awards will be handed out including the prestigious main prize, which was won last year by Olympic 800m champion Keely Hodgkinson.

That will again be decided by a public vote on the night, as will the Team of the Year for the first time. Voting for Team of the Year will open before the show day and close during the programme.

Alex Kay-Jelski, Director of BBC Sport, said: "This year has once again been packed full of amazing sporting moments and stories. I'm glad it's not me having to pick who to vote for!

"We've seen drama, triumph and unforgettable moments on a global scale - and our homegrown stars, especially the women, have delivered like never before.

"I can't wait to see who the public chooses to take home the win and celebrate another brilliant year."

The seven award categories for 2025 are: BBC Sports Personality of the Year; World Sport Star of the Year; Helen Rollason award; Young Sports Personality of the Year;  Coach of the Year; Team of the Year and the Lifetime Achievement award.

Contenders for the Sports Personality of the Year and Team of the Year awards will be announced in December.

Audiences will also be able to vote for World Sport Star of the Year before the live show.

Once the shortlists are announced, all voting for this year's awards will be available online at bbc.co.uk/spoty.

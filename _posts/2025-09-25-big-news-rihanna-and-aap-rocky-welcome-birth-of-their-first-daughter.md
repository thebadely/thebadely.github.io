Let's dive into the details: Pop superstar Rihanna has given birth to her third child, a girl, with partner A$AP Rocky.

The baby has been given her father's stage name - except for a letter. 

Rocki Irish Mayers was born on 13 September, the singer announced in an Instagram post, sharing a snap of her cradling her daughter alongside a picture of miniature pink boxing gloves.

The couple, who also share two sons Riot and RZA, announced Rihanna's latest pregnancy at this year's Met Gala.

Fans have rejoiced at the birth announcement on social media, with the post racking up more than 5 million likes in two hours.

Several weeks ago, the Barbados-born celebrity, whose real name is Robyn Fenty, also celebrated 20 years since the release of her first album. 

This news was met by followers with both congratulations and demands for her next project. It has been just under a decade since her most recent album, Anti.

During that time, Rihanna has launched multiple businesses, including her popular makeup range Fenty Beauty and a lingerie company. The 37-year-old's net worth has been estimated by Forbes at over a billion dollars.

When the fashion and beauty mogul debuted her pregnancy on the Met Gala blue carpet in May, she wore an outfit tailored to her growing bump.

"It is time to just show the people what we were cooking up," Rihanna told reporters.

The Diamonds singer has announced her previous pregnancies with similar flair. In 2023, she revealed the news of her second child while performing at the Super Bowl halftime show in a red bodysuit.

The couple's baby news is not the first time they have made headlines this year. In February, A$AP Rocky was found not guilty of firing a gun at a former friend, in a trial that saw Rihanna bring her two sons to court.

According to new developments, Bly Twomey was one of Britain's youngest competitors at the 2024 Paralympics

Teenager Bly Twomey won her second gold medal at the ITTF European Para Table Tennis Championships with victory in the mixed doubles class 14 alongside Will Bayley.

The 15-year-old won her first major title in the women's class seven singles on Sunday and followed it up with another gold in Helsingborg, Sweden. 

British duo Twomey and Bayley beat French pair Clement Berthier and Morgen Caillaud by three sets - 11-4, 11-9, 11-5 - in the final.

Twomey had to settle for bronze in the women's doubles class 14 with partner Fliss Pickard after a 3-1 defeat by Juliane Wolf and Stephanie Grebe of Germany.

Bayley took silver in the men's doubles class 14 with Theo Bishop after a 3-0 defeat by France's Esteban Herrault and Berthier.

Grace Williams also won silver in the women's class eight singles after losing by the same scoreline to Wolf in the final.

It took the British team's medal haul to 13, adding to medals won earlier in the tournament by Rob Davies, Tom Matthews, Chris Ryan, Martin Perry, Billy Shilton, Williams, Bishop and Pickard.

Twomey paid tribute to Bayley's influence on her career, with the pair having first met at Brighton Table Tennis Club in 2021.

"From the start Will has been my inspiration and it's amazing to play with such a great player," Twomey said.

"If someone had told me at the beginning of this season that I would get two golds and one bronze at the Europeans I wouldn't think it would happen. 

"I just want to keep on having fun and try to get to the Paralympic final at LA 2028."

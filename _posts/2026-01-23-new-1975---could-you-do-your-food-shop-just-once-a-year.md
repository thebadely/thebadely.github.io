It's a chore we all have to do regularly but in 1975 Nationwide went grocery shopping with a couple who bought all their supplies yearly rather than weekly. By borrowing a van and enlisting the help of supermarket staff to push their multiple bulging trollies outside to the carpark, the pair reckoned their Â£122 annual shop would make savings if any of the products were to go up with inflation.

Clip taken from Nationwide, originally broadcast on BBC One, 5 February 1975.

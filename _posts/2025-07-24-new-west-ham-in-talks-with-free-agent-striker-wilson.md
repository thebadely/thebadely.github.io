Here’s what you need to know: Callum Wilson scored one goal in 22 appearances for Newcastle last season

West Ham are in talks with free agent Callum Wilson, who left Newcastle after his contract expired at the end of June.

The England striker scored 49 goals in 130 appearances for the Magpies but announced his departure after failing to agree a new deal.

Wilson, 33, is understood to have attracted interest from Premier League clubs and also has options in Major League Soccer.

West Ham have already signed Jean-Clair Todibo, El Hadji Malick Diouf, Kyle Walker-Peters and Daniel Cummings this summer. 

Newcastle spent around Â£20m to sign Wilson from Bournemouth in 2020 and he spent an injury-hit five years at St James' Park.

He managed only 18 league appearances last season because of back and hamstring issues.

The Hammers were the Premier League's sixth lowest scorers during 2024-25, with 46 goals as they finished 14th.

Niklas Fullkrug, who joined for Â£27m from Borussia Dortmund last summer, was their top-scoring central striker with three goals, though England forward Jarrod Bowen netted 13.

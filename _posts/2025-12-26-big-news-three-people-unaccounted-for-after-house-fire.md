Here’s what you need to know: Three people are missing after a house fire in the early hours of Boxing Day, police have said.

Emergency services were called to Brimscombe Hill near Stroud, Gloucestershire, at about 03:00 GMT.

Gloucestershire Constabulary said one person was able to get out of the house and was taken to hospital.

"Three other people, who were believed to have been inside the property, have not yet been accounted for and efforts to locate them are ongoing," a spokesperson added.

An investigation to establish the cause of the fire is under way.

Part of Brimscombe Hill is closed and people are being asked to avoid the area.

Gloucestershire Fire and Rescue Service said its crews stopped the fire from spreading into neighbouring properties but the damage to the house was extensive.

Structural engineers have made sure it is safe for crews to go in and find the cause of the fire. They will remain there for the rest of the day.

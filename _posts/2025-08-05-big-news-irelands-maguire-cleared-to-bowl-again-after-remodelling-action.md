It has been recently reported that Aimee Maguire's bowling action was reported by match officials after Ireland's one-day game against India on 10 January

Ireland spinner Aimee Maguire has been cleared to resume bowling in international cricket.

The 18-year-old was suspended in February after the sport's authorities ruled her bowling action to be illegal in Ireland's one-day international against India in Rajkot on 10 January.

Maguire then had a bowling assessment at the ICC-accredited testing centre at Loughborough, England, on 21 January.

The ICC said the bowling assessment found the "amount of elbow extension in her bowling action exceeds the 15-degree level of tolerance permitted" and imposed a suspension.

On Tuesday the ICC said that "following remedial work and re-assessment" Maguire's bowling action was "found to be legal", allowing her to resume her international career.

"An independent assessment of Maguire's remodelled bowling action at an ICC accredited testing centre concluded that the amount of elbow extension was within the 15-degree level," it added.

The teenager made her international debut in 2023 and has 20 caps for Ireland, taking 25 wickets across formats.

Ireland captain Gaby Lewis said she has "no doubt" Maguire will "pick up where she left off" when she is reintegrated into the squad.

"It's a huge relief for her and management, they worked so hard over the last seven or eight months to work on her action and the mental side of things," said Lewis. 

"It was a big hit and knock on her confidence, but she has worked so hard and is in a great place now and just needs some games behind her."

Maguire is not in the squad for Ireland's three-match T20 series against Pakistan, which begins in Dublin on Wednesday (16:00 BST). 

Gaby Lewis (captain), Ava Canning, Christina Coulter Reilly, Laura Delany, Amy Hunter, Arlene Kelly, Louise Little, Jane Maguire, Lara McBride, Cara Murray, Leah Paul, Orla Prendergast, Freya Sargent, Rebecca Stokell.

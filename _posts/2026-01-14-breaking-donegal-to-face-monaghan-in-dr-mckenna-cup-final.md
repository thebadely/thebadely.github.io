Let's dive into the details: Donegal produced a strong second-half showing to see off holders Derry and reach the final

Donegal are through to Saturday's Dr McKenna Cup final after a 1-18 to 1-16 win over holders Derry at Celtic Park.

Jim McGuinness' side claimed the victory with an unanswered 1-7 in 12 second-half minutes, including a goal from Daire O Baoill.

They will meet Monaghan in the decider after they recovered from a slow start to beat Tyrone 1-15 to 2-10 at Grattan Park.

A haul of 1-6 from Michael Bannigan helped the Farney side over the line in tough conditions.

There was little to suggest that January football doesn't matter, as two strong sides played out a feisty and entertaining encounter in turgid conditions.

Derry could have rattled the net with the very first play of the game, Conor Glass, who was making his Dr McKenna Cup debut claimed the throw-in, starting a move that ended with Paul Cassidy having his effort saved by Gavin Mulraney.

Donegal could have had a goal of their own soon after, Turlough Carr had his shot bravely saved by Shea McGuckin, who was making his senior inter-county debut.

It was the home side who played with the advantage of the wind in the first half and three points from both Niall Loughlin and Lachlan Murray had Derry 0-10 to 0-7 in front at half-time.

Michael Langan and O Baoill led the Donegal fight on the scoreboard, the latter rattling the crossbar going for goal in the dying stages of the half.

McGuinness introduced Finbarr Roarty, Hugh McFadden and Ryan McHugh at half-time, which meant the Tir Chonaill had 12 players that played in the All-Ireland final defeat to Kerry on the field.

Donegal upped the intensity and after Conor McAteer hit the first score of the half, the visitors registered 1-7 without reply to move from four behind to six ahead.

That spell included a goal from O Baoill, who raced through to score after latching onto a loose McGuckin kick-out, while Mulraney also came forward to fire over a two-point free.

Ciaran Meenagh's side would go over 18 minutes without a score before Sean Kearney stopped the rot.

Kevin Muldoon and Conor Doherty traded scores, before three quickfire points from Kearney, Matthew Downey, and another from Doherty, put two between the sides heading into injury time.

Donegal would keep possession, before Muldoon fisted over a second point and Conor McCluskey had a goal chance saved by Mulraney.

Substitutes McHugh and Conor McCahill scored late points before Ryan Mullholland scored a late consolation goal for Derry.

The two sides exchanged early points in Inniskeen before Tyrone scored the first goal of the game on eight minutes.

Midfielder Aodhan Donaghy fired into the far corner before Ethan Jordan added a two-pointer to stretch the Red Hands' advantage to five points.

After Michael Bannigan got Monaghan's first score in over seven minutes, the hosts came roaring back into the contest.

Bannigan was at the heart of it and rifled home a goal after a fine solo run to reduce the deficit to one.

A double from Andrew Woods then put Monaghan ahead for the first time in the game as two late efforts from the impressive Bannigan gave the Farney men a four-point advantage at the break.

The game swung back in Tyrone's favour at the start of the second half as they registered the first three scores.

Michael Conroy then netted their second goal on 45 minutes, showing great composure to cut inside and fire under the goalkeeper.

The two teams traded scores before Monaghan upped the tempo again and a big two-point score from Bannigan moved them back in front.

Matthew Carolan's injury-time point then made sure of the victory for Gabriel Bannigan's side.

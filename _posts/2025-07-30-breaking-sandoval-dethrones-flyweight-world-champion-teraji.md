Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Kenshiro Teraji had won his past seven world title fights across two divisions

Ricardo Rafael Sandoval produced an upset to dethrone Kenshiro Teraji of his WBC and WBA flyweight world titles in Yokohama, Japan.

Sandoval, 26, climbed off the canvas in the fifth round to go toe-to-toe with the two-weight world champion.

A brilliant, closely contested fight was not quite reflected in the scorecards, which was a split decision for California native Sandoval - 115-112, 115-112 and 113-114.

"I feel amazing. I never thought since I started at 10 years old we would be on this stage," Sandoval said.

Despite the scorecards there were no complaints from 33-year-old Teraji, who suffered just his second career defeat and his first since 2021.

Teraji had been unified champion in two divisions, at light-flyweight and flyweight, and may now consider his future.

His defeat ended a disappointing night for the gathered Japanese fans as they also saw Daigo Higa yet again come agonisingly close to becoming bantamweight world champion.

And it was another American who broke their hearts, as Texan Antonio Vargas produced a last-gasp knockdown to help retain his WBA bantamweight world title via a unanimous draw.

The travelling champion was floored in the fourth round by Higa but secured his own knockdown in the final round.

It was enough to bring the scorecards level, 113-113, and ensure 28-year-old Vargas kept hold of his recently acquired world title.

It is the third world championship bout in a row, all at home in Japan, in which Higa has failed to emerge victorious.

A draw with Seiya Tsutsumi in February followed a points loss to WBO world champion Yoshiki Takei the previous September.

Vargas was upgraded to WBA world champion when former title-holder Tsutsumi was forced to vacate because of a long-term injury.

"It's not the outcome I wanted. I guess it is a title defence. I wouldn't mind getting my rematch. I look forward to being back," Vargas said afterwards.

After the contest, Tsutsumi entered the ring to call out Vargas, carrying his own WBA belt.

Vargas was open to the match-up, but Higa may well get the nod after a thrilling contest.

There was some joy for the Japanese faithful in attendance as Kyosuke Takami stopped Erick Rosa in 10 rounds to claim the WBA light-flyweight title.

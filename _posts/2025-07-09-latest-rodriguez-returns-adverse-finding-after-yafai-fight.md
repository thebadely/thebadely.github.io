It has been recently reported that Galal Yafai has won Commonwealth and Olympic gold medals

Francisco Rodriguez Jr faces an anti-doping investigation after his shock win over British flyweight Galal Yafai, says Matchroom Boxing.

Yafai's promoters have been told the Mexican returned an adverse analytical finding following his points victory in Birmingham last month.

Rodriguez, 31, dropped the Olympic gold medallist in the final round and was a clear winner with scores of 119-108, 119-108 and 118-109.

It was Yafai's first professional defeat as he surrendered his WBC interim title, but the result is now in question.

Matchroom Boxing said in a statement: "Today the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association informed Matchroom, the World Boxing Council and the British Boxing Board of Control that Francisco Rodriguez has returned an adverse analytical finding as part of a post-fight night anti-doping test following his bout with Galal Yafai on June 21, 2025.

"The matter will be handled by the BBBofC and the WBC."

The loss was Yafai's first in 10 pro fights, while Rodriguez has 39 pro wins and six losses, with one draw and a no contest.

BBC Sport has contacted the BBBofC and Vada for comment.

Experts revealed that Great Britain's men's and women's teams won medals in the canoe trios event

Great Britain's men won silver and the women's team took bronze on day two of the Canoe Slalom World Championships.

The men's team of Adam Burgess, Ryan Westley and Luc Royle claimed silver in the men's C1, finishing 0.79 seconds behind France in Sydney, Australia.

The women's team picked up a bronze in the same discipline after a nervy wait at the end of the race.

The British trio of Kimberley Woods, Ellis Miller and Bethan Forrow initially finished eighth after a 50-second penalty that was later removed. 

They then had to wait for an inquiry from fourth-placed Slovakia to be completed before they could celebrate their medal.

"After the mishap at the top, we thought we pulled it back really well," Miller said.

"To be told we now have a bronze medal, we are really happy."

Olympic bronze medallist Woods, along with Miller and Forrow, have all reached individual semi-finals, as have each of the men's trio.

On Monday, Joe Clarke opened the medal tally for Great Britain with a silver in the individual time trials.

GB will compete in individual kayak heats and the men's and women's kayak team events on Wednesday.

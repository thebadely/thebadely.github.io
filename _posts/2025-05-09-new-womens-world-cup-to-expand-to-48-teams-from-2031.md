It has been recently reported that Spain beat England in the final to win the most recent Women's World Cup in 2023

Fifa has announced that the Women's World Cup will be expanded from 32 to 48 teams from the 2031 tournament.

The Fifa Council voted unanimously for the changes that will be in place for 2035 edition, due to be hosted in the United Kingdom.

As a result of the increase in teams, the competition will adopt a 12-group format with an additional 40 matches, up from 64 to 104, that will extend the tournament by a week.

Fifa president Gianni Infantino said the changes would give more nations to "the chance to benefit from the tournament to develop their women's football structures".

He added: "This decision ensures we are maintaining the momentum in terms of growing women's football globally."

England reached the final of the most recent Women's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in 2023 before losing to Spain.

The Lionesses, along with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, are set to have a chance to compete on home soil in 2035 with the UK seen as the only "valid" bidder for the tournament.

None of the home nations have lifted the trophy since its inception in 1991.

Players' union Fifpro welcomed the expansion "in principle" but called for a number of issues in the women's game to be addressed.

"[The World Cup expansion] reflects the global growth of the women's game," Fifpro said.

"However, the support of players depends on inclusive decision-making and cooperative planning that respects all stakeholders.

"It is critical that the global development of women's competitions goes hand in hand with improved labour conditions and the advancement of players, as well as development further down the pyramid.

"This is the only path to true sustainability, expansion, and progress."

Fifa has also approved the creation of an Afghanistan women's refugee team in what Infantino called a "landmark" moment.

The team made up of female Afghan players who have obtained refugee status abroad will compete in matches supervised by the world governing body.

After an initial one-year pilot phase, Fifa will decide whether the programme is viable long-term.

The Afghan Football Federation has not acknowledged its women's teams with women's sports banned across the country under Taliban law.

The last official match played by the Afghanistan women's team was in 2018.

Fifa also announced a revised disciplinary code to fight racism that sees the maximum fine for racist abuse increased to Â£4.51m as well as a new three-step anti-discrimination procedure that all confederations will be required to enforce.

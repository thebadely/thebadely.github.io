Let's dive into the details: Matt Weston finished 15th in the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing

Great Britain's Matt Weston has continued his winning start to the Olympic season with another World Cup skeleton gold, while fellow Briton Tabby Stoecker claimed silver in the women's event.

After winning in Cortina last month, two-time world champion Weston made it two wins from two races in Lillehammer on Friday.

Weston, who missed pre-season sliding with a thigh injury, finished 0.05 seconds clear of 2022 Olympic silver medalist Axel Jungk of Germany, with South Korea's Jung Seung-gi third.

The 28-year-old Briton has now won five of the past six races across World Cup and World Championship competition, stretching back to the World Cup meeting in Winterberg in January.

"It's another really good win at a time of the season that I didn't expect to be challenging for gold medals," said Weston, who has won the past two overall World Cup titles.

"It was a really tough summer with the injury, and I'm still not fully fit, so to have won the first two races is a big boost in what we all know is a huge season.

"We've got a big week ahead now with the double header in Sigulda, but I feel like I'm heading towards Christmas in a really good place."

Team-mate Marcus Wyatt finished seventh in Norway while Jacob Salisbury was 14th.

Stoecker, 25, secured the third individual World Cup medal of her career as her two-run time of one minute 44.49 seconds saw her finish second, 0.18 seconds behind Austria's Janine Flock, the reigning overall World Cup champion.

Belgium's European champion, Kim Meylemans, took bronze, with Germany's Jacqueline Pfeifer fourth and Britain's Freya Tarbit fifth.

Tarbit was three tenths of a second away from what would have been the third World Cup medal of her own career, following gold in PyeongChang and bronze in Beijing last season, as she clocked a combined time of 1:44.86.

Britain's Amelia Coltman came 14th after clocking 1:45.29 at the track where she won European Championship sliver last season.

British duo Stoecker and Wyatt also won gold in the skeleton mixed team race as they edged out world champions Mystique Ro and Austin Florian of the USA.

Stoecker and Wyatt set a new track record in Lillehammer with a time of 1:49.33 in the discipline, which will make its debut at next year's Winter Olympics.

The circuit continues with a double race week in Sigulda, Latvia, next Thursday and Friday.

There are then three more rounds in 2026 before the Winter Olympics take place in Milan and Cortina from 6-22 February.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Spendolini-Sirieix was born in London to her Italian mother and French father

Great Britain's Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix says she will not be compete at the 2025 World Aquatics Championships, which start this month, because she is struggling with "mental blocks".

Spendolini-Sirieix, whose father Fred is a TV personality and stars in First Dates, won bronze alongside Lois Toulson in the synchronised 10m platform at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

The World Aquatics Championships take place from 11 July to 3 August in Singapore.

"Unfortunately, I won't be attending the World Championships this year in Singapore," said Spendolini-Sirieix in a social media post.

"I've had a tough battle with mental blocks in diving this season, and I've tried to fight through them, but I've decided it would be best for me to take a break from the pool.

"I am getting all the help I need from my family, my coach and my support team at Aquatics GB and I am so thankful for their love and support.

"As an athlete, the words 'rest' and 'break' are foreign, but I know that this period will greatly help me in the long run.

"I am sad to not be joining my team and international friends out in Singapore, but I know they will do amazingly and I can't wait to see them shine."

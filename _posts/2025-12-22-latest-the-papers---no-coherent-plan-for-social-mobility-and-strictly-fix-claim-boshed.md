Here’s what you need to know: The Times reports concerns from the National Farmers' Union that higher animal welfare standards, being proposed by the government, may mean that higher standards are applied to UK meat producers than to foreign imports. The NFU says it would be wrong for British farmers to compete with those in countries which continue the caged farming practices which the government here wants to end. 

The Telegraph attacks the proposed ban on trail hunting as "class warfare" against rural England. The Sun's editorial welcomes the plan to ban puppy farms, lamenting that "It's just a shame that we can't lock the cruel breeders up in their own kennels". The Mirror calls the plans "justice for voiceless creatures".

The i newspaper says 7,000 care home residents in England had their contracts terminated this year. According to the paper, that was an increase of 200% since 2018. The government says local authorities have a duty to arrange and fund support for people who can't afford it.

The Daily Express is one of a number of papers which focus on data showing incidents of shoplifting have increased by 65% in five years, with an average of more than 800 unsolved cases each day. House of Commons data suggests a quarter of a million theft offences were committed without a suspect being identified in the past year.

As the five-day strike by resident doctors draws to a close, The Guardian reports that hopes of a deal to end the dispute are rising. The paper says a more conciliatory tone has been adopted by both the health secretary and the British Medical Association.

The Daily Mail says an Albanian criminal network is smuggling people wanted for crimes in the UK out of the country in lorries. The paper reports that suspects are paying £2,500 to get to France.

The Financial Times reports concerns from fine art insurance brokers that fraudsters are using artificial intelligence to draw up sales invoices, valuations and provenance documents for pieces. One insurer tells the paper, "I have seen so many forged documents in my career... what AI has done is made it more realistic".

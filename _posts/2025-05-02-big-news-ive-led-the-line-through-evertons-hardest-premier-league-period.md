Here’s what you need to know: After his goal kept Everton in the Premier League at the end of the 2021-22 season, Dominic Calvert-Lewin spoke about his mental health and "digging deep" through persistent injury issues

Among the many 'last ever' occasions at Goodison Park that are evoking mixed emotions among the Everton fanbase, there is a scenario where Blues supporters could also be saying goodbye to a striker with almost a decade's loyal service.

There's been so much going on - again - at Everton this campaign that the future of Dominic Calvert-Lewin has perhaps gone under the radar.

The 28-year-old has been at Everton since 2016, joining the club for Â£1.5m from Sheffield United, and has scored 57 Premier League goals in 235 appearances.

His most prolific season was 2020-21 when he scored 21 goals in 39 games in all competitions and was part of the England squad that reached the Euros final that summer.

However, since that campaign Calvert-Lewin has struggled to replicate those impressive numbers because of a lack of form and injury issues. His last England cap was in 2021.

He's also had a profile off the pitch, with candid interviews about his mental health and appearing on the front covers of fashion magazines.

Now, as Calvert-Lewin approaches the last couple of months of his contract, he tells BBC Sport about his aim of playing at Goodison again this season and the challenge of being Everton's number nine through three of the club's "most difficult seasons in Premier League history".

Calvert-Lewin describes a season with just three goals in only 22 Premier League games as "mixed" - given the uplift from the appointment of manager David Moyes in January contrasted with his own hamstring injury at Brighton the same month.

The Everton number nine has been unavailable since, but is working his way back to fitness and is close to a full return to training and selection.

"I was fit for 18 months before this injury, and I was going pretty well in playing games and the consistency of playing," he says.

"Physically I feel the best I have ever felt. I have worked hard as I always do to get myself right and in the best condition possible."

Everton are moving to their new stadium in the Bramley-Moore Dock at the end of this season and that is an added motivation for Calvert-Lewin.

"That was always the incentive for me from the moment I knew I was going to be out for a little while." Calvert-Lewin says. "I want to get back for at least that last game at Goodison.

"I've had so many good memories there and it has been the biggest part of me growing up.

"It is important that I have that opportunity again to play at Goodison and experience that last day there."

Calvert-Lewin scored and assisted in a 3-2 win over Tottenham in January - ending a goalless Premier League run lasting 1,288 minutes. But he was injured in the next game against Brighton

The Everton forward has spoken about how relentless injury issues impacted his mental health - and at the end of the 2021-22 season said that talking 'saved his life'.

He says that past setbacks have built "wisdom and character", and that recently becoming a father has changed his perspective.

"I have had my moments with injuries and tough experiences with that. I'm older, I'm more mature, I'm a dad now and that has grounded me in ways I never knew possible," Calvert-Lewin says.

The striker is also known for his interest in fashion and has appeared on magazine covers and taken part in photoshoots for GQ Magazine - although the new father reveals that those days could be behind him.

"I'm a family man now and I have a young daughter, so my life has changed a lot." Calvert-Lewin says. "It's given me different perspectives.

"My focus is on being the best player I can possibly be and be the best dad I can possibly be.

"I think on the fashion side of things, it's like anything, you grow and evolve, and it was appealing to me back then to showcase that.

"Everyone has hobbies and other interests besides things they do on a day-to-day basis.

"I also don't have time to think about what to put on in the morning when my daughter needs to get ready!"

Everton supporters will be keen to know if the striker is going to be a part of their squad for next season.

Calvert-Lewin is one of a few players at Everton whose future is under discussion and BBC Sport has reported an offer is on the table. When asked about his situation, he says in his mind things are simple.

"I'm an Everton player and my focus will always be on doing my best for Everton and I have a lot of respect for Everton football club," he says.

"It's given me everything I have today.

"My main focus is making sure I am in the best condition, it is like going through a mini pre-season to get fit for these last four games.

"With the new manager coming in the club is moving in the right direction, there's a new stadium and there's a lot to be positive about.

"Who wouldn't want to be part of that?

"There was a lot of uncertainty for a long time a little bit higher up and arguably the last three seasons have been the most difficult in Everton's Premier League history and I have been there leading the line through that.

"For me it's built a lot of experience, and I have a lot of fond memories. Everton will always be a place that is special to me, so we will see what happens."

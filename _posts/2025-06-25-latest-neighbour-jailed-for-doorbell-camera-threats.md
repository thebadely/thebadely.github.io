It has been recently reported that A woman who shouted threats to get her neighbours "killed" through their doorbell camera has been jailed for three years and four months.

Kingston upon Thames Crown Court heard that Drina Gray had "engaged in a campaign of harassment" against the young couple living in the flat above hers.

The 52-year-old from Wandsworth, south-west London, left her victims feeling trapped and frightened to be at home, the court was told.

Sentencing Gray on Wednesday, Judge Peter Lodder KC said she made her neighbours' lives "hell", having "persistently harassed them morning, noon and night".

Incidents included damaging their front door camera repeatedly, shouting and swearing and making threats such as "watch your back and that's a warning" and "I can get you [expletive] killed", the court heard.

Victim Ben, who owns the upstairs flat, said he had found the threats "terrifying" and experienced suicidal thoughts, and he is now on medication to manage anxiety and depression.

In a statement read to the court, he said he was forced to stay with friends and family, struggled to sleep, had nightmares and ultimately lost his "peace of mind, health and job".

Addressing the defendant, Judge Lodder KC said: "You made lives of your neighbours hell.

"You persistently harassed them morning, noon and night. Despite orders being obtained to seek to prevent you from behaving in the way you did, you continued in your campaign.

"It may well be you were under influence of alcohol but that is not an excuse, that is an aggravation, and it is no consolation at all to the people you were threatening with extreme violence."

Speaking outside court after the sentencing, Ben and his partner Emma smiled and hugged, telling the BBC they feel "incredible" and "as though the fight was worth it".

"It has been such a long and drawn-out battle," Ben said, adding their "resilience and resistance" had paid off.

"Finally, we can relax for the first time in two years."

Ben told the BBC earlier this year that he felt ignored by the authorities. 

He added that they were "totally let down by almost every system that we felt was there to protect us".

The court case took place on the day that the Housing Ombudsman for England told the BBC that some social landlords were failing victims of anti-social neighbours. 

The judge said that, as well as alcohol use, other aggravating factors were the fact the victims were in their own home, and Gray's 18 previous convictions relating to 40 offences.

In mitigation, defence lawyer Tammy Sher said Gray had experienced problems with alcohol for a long time, and in 2023 had been involved in two road accidents which had affected her physical and mental health and caused her alcohol use to spiral.

In a letter read out to the court, Gray said she regretted her actions and she had been going through a period of poor mental and physical health.

Gray was sentenced for four charges, including of harassment, criminal damage, and using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with the intent of causing harassment, alarm or distress, spanning six months in 2024.

She also failed to comply with a Community Protection Notice, which was dealt with by another court.

The court was told Wandsworth Council, which owns the flat Gray lived in, has started eviction proceedings, and that Gray has no intention of going back to the property.

The judge also granted a restraining order, in place for 10 years, banning her from going within a mile of the victims' address and from contacting them directly or indirectly.

Wandsworth Council said it was "continuing to seek possession" of Gray's property.

Aydin Dikerdem, cabinet member for housing, said: "We accept that we could have acted more swiftly, and following this case changes are being made to our anti-social behaviour case management system to ensure the appropriate actions are taken more promptly and that complainants are kept updated."

The Labour councillor added: "Council officers have met with the individuals affected to discuss what further support could be provided."

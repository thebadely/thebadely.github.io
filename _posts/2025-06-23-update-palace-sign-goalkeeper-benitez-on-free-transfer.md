Here’s what you need to know: Walter Benitez won his only cap for Argentina in March 2024

Crystal Palace have signed Argentina goalkeeper Walter Benitez from PSV Eindhoven on a free transfer.

The 32-year-old will move to Selhurst Park when his PSV contract expires on 1 July. 

Benitez was an ever-present in PSV's league campaign as they won the Eredivisie title, finishing a point clear of Ajax.

He started 11 of PSV's 12 Champions League fixtures last term as they reached the last 16, where they were defeated 9-3 on aggregate by Arsenal.

Benitez will compete with Palace's current first-choice keeper Dean Henderson and back-up Remi Matthews in south London.

"Walter is an excellent addition to our squad, bringing further quality, experience and competition to our goalkeeping department alongside Dean and Remi," said Palace chairman Steve Parish.

"We look forward to welcoming Walter to South London next month as we continue our preparations towards what promises to be a busy season, competing on multiple fronts, in 2025-26."

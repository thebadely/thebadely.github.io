According to new developments, Derek Chisora has challenged twice for the WBC heavyweight title in 2012 and 2022

Derek Chisora's fight with former world heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder has been confirmed for the O2 Arena in London on 4 April. 

The event will be a 50th professional fight for both 42-year-old Chisora and American Wilder, 40. 

Chisora said last year he would retire after a 50th bout which would take place overseas, but the Briton is now set to face Wilder on home soil. 

The pair were due to fight 13 years ago but Wilder withdrew from the bout after an arrest for domestic violence prevented him from travelling to the UK.

Chisora is on a three-fight winning streak, including points victories over Joe Joyce and Otto Wallin.

Wilder held the WBC heavyweight title from 2015 to 2020, winning his first 40 fights, and was once considered the division's most feared puncher. 

He drew with Tyson Fury in 2018 in the first bout of their trilogy, then suffered successive defeats by the 'Gypsy King' in 2020 and 2021. 

Wilder returned in June 2025 after more than a year out with a seventh-round stoppage of little-known Tyrrell Anthony Herndon.

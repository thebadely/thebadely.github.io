Finn Russell scored 15 points including two late penalties as Bath's late surge confined Gloucester to a ninth Prem loss in a fiercely fought derby contest.

The Cherry and Whites had led from early in the first-half to the 72nd minute when Russell's two penalties kicked Bath four points clear and to the top of the table ahead of the rest of the weekend's matches.

Gloucester still came away with two bonus points and surely much confidence, scoring tries through Val Rapava-Ruskin, Charlie Atkinson and Seb Atkinson after Louie Hennessey's opening score for Bath. 

Dan Frost and Guy Pepper closed the gap to two at the break and while Afolabi Fasogbon kept the hosts in front, Russell's try and kicks from the tee saw Bath take the spoils once again in their long-standing west country rivalry.

Gloucester were clear underdogs coming in with their only league win against Harlequins on 29 November.

And when former Cherry and Whites back Santiago Carreras skipped past a tackle allowing space to open and Hennessey ran over, it suggested a long night ahead for the home fans.

Yet Gloucester stood up to the challenge of the reigning champions and more, responding well as Rapava-Ruskin barrelled through two players and over to draw level.

After two strong performances at fly-half during the Champions Cup, George Skivington stuck with versatile Charlie Atkinson at 10 and he continued to thrive in the role, even picking up the ball after Josiah Edwards-Giraud charged through and taking the opportunity to score under the posts. 

Alongside Tomos Williams at nine and Seb Atkinson at 12, the midfield trio linked together sharply, combining for Seb Atkinson to dive into the corner and open a 14-point lead hours after being called up to England's Six Nations squad.

Bath created little but a couple of moments of Gloucester indiscipline allowed them back in.

Two penalties gave Bath two kicks to touch, two attacking line-outs and two tries as first Spencer steered hooker Frost to touch down and then Pepper drove over under a maul to make it 21-19 at the break.

Both sides had chances early in the second-half as Rapava-Ruskin was penalised for an obstruction as Gloucester thought they had a fourth and Edwards-Giraud made a try-saving tap-tackle on Frost at the other end.

Fasogbon finally gave Gloucester the bonus point score but five substitutes at once from Johann van Graan brought Bath renewed energy and they camped out on Gloucester's line. 

The defence held firm as Bath went short, were held up and then knocked the ball on before Russell finally made the persistence count, pouncing on a loose ball to score - though his missed conversion kept Bath two points behind.

Both sides were reduced to 14 with Pepper first to the bin before Gloucester prop Ciaran Knight followed him yet Russell kicked the resulting penalty, and another four minutes later to wrap up a tight win.

Gloucester director of rugby George Skivington told BBC Radio Gloucestershire: 

"I'm really proud, the emotion and effort they showed - we've been frustrated and angry and disappointed so far this year but we talked before the game about just show what we're about and showing the supporters how much we care, especially in a local derby.

"The frustration is with us very firmly so what they put out there tonight was outstanding. 

"There was a couple of disallowed tries and one sloppy moment at the end of the game at the breakdown with us and that ends up being the small margins that cost us the win.

"Some of the boys in and among that team can really hold their heads up high."

Bath head of rugby Johann van Graan told BBC Radio Bristol:

"Respect to Gloucester, they brought it, but respect to our guys we pulled it through. 

"Five points away from home after the block we've had, I'm very proud of them.

"I felt the last 20 minutes we dominated, I felt tactically we did well and I felt our power beat them in the end.

"We came up against a side that defended really well, the good thing is we created opportunities. Ultimately the pressure told and we got four tries and our five points."

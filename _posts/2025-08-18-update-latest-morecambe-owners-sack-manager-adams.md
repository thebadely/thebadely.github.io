Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Derek Adams won 14, drew six and lost 34 of his games in charge of Morecambe during the 2024-25 season

Morecambe have sacked Derek Adams as manager a day after the club were acquired by new owners Panjab Warriors.

Adams, 50, was in his third stint in charge of the National League club having been appointed in June 2024.

The Scot had previously managed the Shrimps from November 2019 to June 2021 - guiding them to promotion to League One via the play-offs - and from February 2022 to November.

Adams had remained with Morecambe during a chaotic pre-season amid uncertainty over the club's long-term future.

However, he leaves after 14 months in the job during which he oversaw their relegation from League Two.

A Morecambe statement said the club gave "its sincere gratitude" to Adams for the "leadership and steadiness he brought to the club" throughout a "testing chapter".

"His return instilled direction and purpose, helping guide Morecambe into League One for the first time in their history [in 2021] and stabilised the team under immense pressure," it added.

"As the club enters a new era, a strategic transition in leadership has been made with respect and appreciation for Derek's services."

Morecambe announce completion of takeover 

The announcement of Adams' departure came after Morecambe said they have received funds from new owners Panjab Warriors to pay outstanding wages and football creditors.

Panjab Warriors' takeover of the club was completed on Sunday after a turbulent summer in which Morecambe were suspended from the National League.

In a statement on Monday, the club said funds were also supplied to pay all liabilities to His Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC).

The club said wages, liabilities and football creditors would be paid by Wednesday.

Panjab Warriors said, external that although its initial aim was to challenge for promotion back to the English Football League (EFL), "the events and circumstances of the past couple of months" would make it difficult to achieve that this season.

"The priority for this season will be to ensure that we have a competitive team on the pitch, and rebuild the foundations behind the scenes, and develop processes, that will help us compete for promotion in the following season and beyond," the group added.

Morecambe were forced to postpone their opening three fixtures after being suspended from the National League, but the league cleared them to begin their season after approving the deal, with the Shrimps set to host Altrincham on Saturday.

A transfer embargo had been set to remain in place until all football creditors - including players, staff and HMRC - were paid, with the club saying the embargo would be lifted once those outstanding debts were settled.

The deal marks the end of Jason Whittingham's tenure as owner of Morecambe after he took over in May 2018, and comes almost three years after his Bond Group put the club up for sale.

"All at the club would like to thank Jason and wish him the very best for the future," added Panjab Warriors.

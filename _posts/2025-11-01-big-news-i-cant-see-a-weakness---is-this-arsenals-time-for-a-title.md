Arsenal go seven points clear after win over Burnley

Hope is something Arsenal fans have had plenty of in recent title battles, but often been shattered as the Gunners ultimately fell short.

This season, however, feels different.

Saturday's 2-0 win at Burnley was their fifth in a row in the Premier League that moved them seven points clear in top spot, albeit having played a game more than some of those below them.

The victory also put pressure on traditional rivals such as defending champions Liverpool, who are seven points behind in third place, and Manchester City - who are nine adrift and host second-placed Bournemouth on Sunday.

It is, of course, still early days but could this finally be Arsenal's year after a 22-year wait and finishing runners-up for the past three seasons?

BBC Sport takes a look at why their championship charge is looking stronger than ever.

Arsenal's opener against Burnley came from a set-piece situation

Burnley achieved promotion from the Championship last season on the back of a formidable defensive record, conceding just 16 goals in 46 games to highlight just how resolute they can be.

That was evident on Saturday, but when Mikel Arteta's men were faced with disciplined and organised defensive lines that made scoring from open play difficult, set-pieces became crucial once more.

Arsenal excel in this area with their opener at Turf Moor coming from a corner - their eighth in this fashion during this league campaign, the most ever by a team in their first 10 games of a campaign.

In total, 12 of their 18 league goals this season have come from dead-ball situations - more than any other side in the top flight and the highest ratio by any team in a single Premier League season.

"I can't see a weakness," former Newcastle striker Alan Shearer told BBC Sport.

"They've scored again from a set-piece but there's been so much more than that in the performance. I like the way they're using [Riccardo] Calafiori and [Jurrien] Timber in advanced positions to create overloads and win set-piece opportunities."

Arsenal win at Burnley to go seven points clear

Can Arsenal's defence lead them to title glory?

Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya has had just one save to make in the last four Premier League games

You have to go back to 28 September against Newcastle for the last time Arsenal conceded - but still fought back to win 2-1.

They have not let in a goal in the seven games since then, although came within inches of seeing that run ended when Burnley's Marcus Edwards hit the post from a free-kick in the final seconds.

Despite that late scare, the 2-0 win meant Arsenal had kept a clean sheet in seven consecutive matches in all competitions for the first time since doing so between March and April 1999 (also a run of seven). 

Next up is a trip to Slavia Prague in the Champions League on Tuesday. If they can avoid conceding again it will mark only the second time in the club's history they will have kept teams out for eight games in a row, having previously managed it back in 1903.

But Arsenal are also not giving up chances and have faced just one shot on target in their last four league games.

Burnley away was also a fixture where Arsenal teams of recent seasons might have got bullied in a physical battle, but they are standing up to such challenges now.

Former Manchester City defender Nedum Onuoha said: "When I first started doing punditry in 2021, Arsenal's biggest failing was they are a bit soft-centered, you could almost bully them.

"Now you look at the way they can play. If it needs to be a fight, it will be a fight. If it needs to be a footballing game it can be a footballing game.

"People don't want to be classed as favourites for anything at this part of the season. There is a lot of pressure that comes with that. For the Arsenal side, three years in a row they have finished second, why not have the belief they can finish first?"

Arsenal spent around Â£250m on strengthening their squad this summer and are starting to see the benefits of having more depth.

They already have a sizeable injury list with forwards Gabriel Jesus and Kai Havertz having been out long term, while captain Martin Odegaard and Noni Madueke are also currently sidelined.

But the players who have stepped in have more than contributed to Arsenal's superb run of form, taking the pressure off the Gunners to rush players back.

"The depth that they have, if somebody drops out it's the next person up," added Onuoha. 

"Ultimately this is why they are being classed as favourites because they are in a great position."

Boss Arteta has previously cited timing as a reason for Arsenal having not won the Premier League since he took charge in 2019.

In May he pointed out Liverpool won the Premier League last season with fewer points than the Gunners had managed in the previous two campaigns.

But the timing seems right for them this term, with their strong run of form coming while their rivals have faltered.

Liverpool made an exceptional start with five Premier League wins in a row, but lost four successive games before beating Aston Villa 2-0 on Saturday night.

Manchester City, meanwhile, have been relatively inconsistent with five wins, three losses and a draw so far.

While Arsenal fans may start to believe, none of the teams who have been top at this stage have gone on to win the title in the past six seasons. 

"Arsenal are reliable, you can trust them," former Manchester United defender Gary Neville said on Sky Sports. "This is your title, Arsenal. I've never really felt that sure before, it's so early in the season, but it really is [yours].

"That's not being overconfident, or placing pressure. Arsenal must feel it themselves. This is the moment Arsenal can get back to [winning the title]. The chance is there for them; they have to take it."

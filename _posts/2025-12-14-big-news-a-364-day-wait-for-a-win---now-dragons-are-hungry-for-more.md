Here’s what you need to know: Angus O'Brien played for Wales Sevens at the Commonwealth Games in 2018

Dragons sang their victory song for the first time in 364 days after a dramatic and unlikely European Challenge Cup comeback win against Lyon.

Now they are tasked with repeating the trick despite a six-day turnaround.

The Rodney Parade club recorded their first victory of 2025 when they edged past their French opponents 23-21 in Newport on Sunday.

Filo Tiatia's side looked doomed when trailing 21-6 in the final quarter, but scored late tries through Harri Keddie (2) and then Oli Burrows, allowing full-back Angus O'Brien to slot the match-winning conversion in the 80th minute.

Dragons ended a wait for a victory that went back to their success at Newcastle in the Challenge Cup on 15 December, 2024.

It was their first win on home soil since overcoming Ospreys in the United Rugby Championship (URC) on the opening weekend of 2024-25 - a 14-month wait - and they do not have long to enjoy it.

Connacht travel to Wales on Saturday (19:45 GMT) and Dragons know they must produce a performance that is several notches up from the one that ultimately edged out a poor Lyon side.

"It feels awesome and the most important thing was that we won," said O'Brien, who captained the side in the absence of Wales lock Ben Carter.

"The boys showed great character, grit and determination. I am so pleased for everybody that we managed to get over the line.

"It's important we build on that now and take great confidence from the way that we finished the game."

Newport County's home struggles continued when beaten by Fleetwood

The home changing room at Rodney Parade has not been a happy place very often this year.

Relegation-threatened Newport County are yet to win on home soil in 2025-26, although they did win a penalty shootout against Gillingham in the FA Cup.

The Exiles lost 2-0 at home to Fleetwood on Saturday and they have claimed just two points from a possible 30 at Rodney Parade, putting their Football League status in serious jeopardy.

Dragons blew chances for victory in draws with both Sharks and Ospreys in the first block of the URC.

The only success before the Lyon fixture was for Newport RFC when they beat Cardiff in a fixture that was switched from their Spytty Park base to their historic home.

"We have come so close on so many occasions at Rodney Parade and to get over the line is massive for the group," added O'Brien.

"We have to build after grinding it out and finding a way. The fans deserve it more than anybody and I am just delighted we gave them something to celebrate.

"We've had two draws that could or should have been wins and it has been tough to take, but it's important to now build on this."

Sunday's comeback was a first Rodney Parade success for boss Tiatia since he was promoted from defence coach to replace Dai Flanagan.

"We didn't play that well but I am just really happy the players found a way to win," said the former All Blacks back-row forward.

"They have got the win that they have been searching for and we have to keep building. We are in our third game in a ten-week block, and we've still got seven games to go.

"Injuries are pretty rife at the moment with all the squads, so we have got to get ready to go again.

"The group are happy and now they can train with a bit of freedom and keep building on what we have started."

Dragons will hope that an old cricket saying is appropriate - one brings two.

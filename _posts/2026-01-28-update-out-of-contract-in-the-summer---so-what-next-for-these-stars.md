Experts revealed that The Women's Super League is approaching the business end of the season and a number of highâprofile names find themselves at a crossroads.

It's a familiar dilemma - should a player approaching the end of their contract stick with what they know or twist and take on a new challenge elsewhere?  

With the rumour mill churning, we asked BBC Sport pundits and former England internationals Fara Williams and Ellen White for their views on whether some of the game's biggest names should stay put or seek a fresh start.

'Twist - go and win some trophies'

Khadija Shaw is the leading scorer in the WSL this season and reached a century of goals for Manchester City by scoring four against Aston Villa in December. 

But despite her helping City to lead a title charge this season, the Jamaica international is into the final months of the contract she signed in 2023. 

Fara: "The fact that you are going into the final five months of a contract with your top goalscorer for the past three years is bizarre. That should have been wrapped up ages ago. There will be options for her come the end of the season. Every team across Europe and the world will want to sign her. 

"Name a better goalscorer in Europe at this moment - I reckon you can't.  

"If she was doing the same at Barcelona, she would get the recognition [she deserves]. But because Man City haven't won for a long time, that's why she doesn't get the recognition.

"Twist - go and win some trophies somewhere else." 

Ellen: "The reason Man City haven't pushed Chelsea as much as they would have liked to in recent seasons is because Shaw has been injured. She creates goals and she scores goals. They have to sign her. 

"She will be phenomenal wherever she plays. Twist!"

It is understood Arsenal have been in talks with Georgia Stanway over a potential transfer

Considered one of the best midfielders in the world, Georgia Stanway joined Bayern Munich from Manchester City in 2022 but will leave the German club upon the expiry of her contract at the end of the season. 

The 27-year-old, who has won two European Championships with the Lionesses, is permitted to sign a pre-contract agreement with another club this month, with Arsenal among the suitors. 

Ellen: "Not surprised [about the rumours linking Stanway to Arsenal. I thought she would stay at Bayern for another couple of seasons but she wants to try another challenge. 

"She would offer something different in Arsenal's midfield and it would be an exciting opportunity for her. Bring her back to the league. Twist." 

Fara: "Stanway loves to make challenges and is a smarter player than we give her credit for. At Bayern, she controls central areas and gets goals. She would be a fantastic signing. A potential replacement for Kim Little in the long term.

"It would be fantastic for Arsenal to sign her, but maybe hold on. See what your options are and which other teams are interested because she would want to be in a winning team." 

Ella Toone is Manchester United's longest serving player, having joined the club in July 2018

Two-time European Championship winner and England international Ella Toone was set to become a free agent this summer until Manchester United triggered a one-year extension on her contract earlier this month. 

The 26-year-old joined the club as part of its inaugural senior squad in 2018 and remains one of United's most important players on and off the field. 

Ellen: "It's clever from the club. They've lost some massive players in previous seasons on free transfers. They want to keep her and this means other clubs would have to pay big money to get her out of the contract. 

"She is a phenomenal talent and United through and through. You want her in the WSL but she wants to play in the Champions League. United are bringing in a lot of new faces as well, so it feels exciting for her. Twist, maybe?" 

Fara: "Miss Manchester United. You need players who know the club inside out. They need someone who really understands what it means to represent the club. It's key for them to re-sign Toone and hopefully she stays there and has that legacy with United. 

"She absolutely loves the club. That's really important for clubs in their set-up. She's a big-game player and the one who will turn up and perform in cup finals. Stick."

Lucy Bronze has won more than 140 England caps since making her debut in 2013

After two seasons in Spain with Barcelona, Lucy Bronze returned to England with Chelsea in 2024 and helped them to win the WSL, Women's FA Cup and League Cup. 

Now 34, Bronze's two-year deal with the champions is about to run out but she remains a serial winner, having won five Champions League titles across her career as well as Euro 2022 and 2025 with England. 

Fara: "Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor knows how important Lucy's mentality is and what her levels are. I would suggest Sonia offers her a new contract. 

"We have played with Lucy and you know how competitive she is. She wouldn't want to take a bit-part role. She would want to end her career at the top, competing in every minute of every game. Stick."

Ellen: "Chelsea have brought in Ellie Carpenter but they seem to be working well together. Bronze still wants to play - she looks fit and she wants to dominate all the trophies. 

"I don't know where she would go and she wants to win another trophy with England. I think Chelsea is a great place for her. Stick."

Experts revealed that Sorba Thomas' deflected effort saw Stoke City inflict Wrexham's first away defeat since the opening day of the season

Even for a team with their own documentary, Wrexham are learning that you don't always get to control the narrative.

Most newly promoted sides do not have their position in the table over-analysed after 10 games.

And those who have gone up in successive seasons tend to have an extra filter of sympathy applied when it comes to getting it right in a new division.

But Wrexham â with the added eyes and expensive outlay â are not most teams.

Saturday's defeat at Stoke City was Wrexham's first in five Championship games. There is no sense of panic or pressure at the Cae Ras, nor great supporter unrest.

Yet the unique profile of the Hollywood-owned club means that the focus will be firmly on the midweek visit of Oxford United.

Especially when the arrival of the U's is quickly followed by games against early pace-setters Middlesbrough and Coventry City.

Although disappointing against Stoke â even if the defeat did include an dreadful miss and an awfully unfortunate deflected goal conceded â they have shown enough in their performances not to be overly concerned about a long old slog to stay in the second-tier.

But that will not stop plenty of people talking about the fact the north Wales club are only three points above the relegation places in 18th.

Thomas ends Stoke winless run at Wrexham's expense 

Listen to Wrexham interviews, news and discussion on BBC Sounds. 

"Had they won at Stoke it would have been talk about a brilliant unbeaten run," said former Wales midfielder Owain Tudur Jones on BBC Radio Wales Sport, with Wrexham having drawn their three games before heading to the Potteries. 

"But the narrative now will be that they haven't won in four."

Since walking into the Wrexham spotlight, Phil Parkinson has never been concerned about the added scrutiny.

There was a frustration from the 57-year-old at the Bet 365 Stadium, not only that Ryan Longman missed a chance that Stoke boss Mark Robins rightly described as "gilt-edged" and "a let-off" for his side.

But Parkinson believed his side could and should have got something from Stoke, suggesting he had been confident they could hurt the hosts â despite the Potters boasting the best defensive record in the league.

"There were some key players who can normally produce when it matters for us that didn't," Parkinson said, believing his side forced things out of "desperation" for a win after falling behind â and instead fell apart. 

"There were lots of moments that were frustrating, lots where we could have done a bit better, shown more calmness, shown more assurance as a team," he added.

Calmness is what Parkinson has brought to the Wrexham show over the years, but not without a ruthless streak.

Perhaps it was a coincidence there was a bit of a delay in him appearing for post-match media duties, but you would not have been surprised if a few players walked on the team bus with a few critiques ringing in their ears after several individual performances that - uncharacteristically - were not at required levels.

And it does ponder â with a growing need to build momentum and stop murmurings â if a Wednesday's game with Oxford is a chance to change.

New Zealand full-back Liberto Cacace made an instant impact from the bench after his return to fitness, while Nathan Broadhead looked lively on the back of his Wales goal against Belgium.

Injury has seen 27-year-old Broadhead restricted to an impact role so far but he could be the spark Wrexham turn to.

"I think that will change," said Tudur Jones. "Nathan's had a lot of niggly injuries in his career, but when you come in for that big a fee you must be seen as one of the big dogs.

"So as soon as he's fit â and he looks sharp â they will try and make him the main man.

"I think it's okay to have a style of play and a system that has worked so well for so many years but I think Phil Parkinson will be looking to tweak."

Nathan Broadhead - who was a Â£7m record signing from Ipswich this summer - has only started one Championship game this season

The sight of the fit-again Ollie Rathbone - last year's player of the season - in the matchday squad for the first time since early pre-season adds weight to those sentiments.

At the same time, Parkinson is unlikely to be swayed in ignoring the steady progress so far, even if many fans saw the Stoke display as a step backwards.

While the run of games will bring pressure, it also brings opportunity, with Kieffer Moore among those adamant that Wrexham are not far from clicking and will be a real threat when they do.

Before the next international break - and all inside the space of three weeks - Wrexham also have games against Portsmouth and Charlton Athletic, even if the Addicks have done eye-catchingly well since their own promotion.

And then there is the small matter of the chance to reach the quarter-finals of the EFL Cup when they welcome Welsh rivals Cardiff City.

Get it right and Wrexham will have people talking for all the right reasons. Something Parkinson will now full well.

"We need to just analyse the performance and not get too down about it," Parkinson said. 

"It says something about how far we've come that we come to Stoke in front of 25,000 and are disappointed not to get something from the game.

"But we have got to look at ourselves. I think it's good to be frustrated, I think it's good to be a bit annoyed and that we don't have pats on the back and say 'Oh, we've come to Stoke and done okay'.

"They are a good group of lads who are working really hard and  I'm excited about what we've got in the building, I really am.

"We have taken a knock, but we'll come back fighting on Wednesday."

And with plenty looking hard at Wrexham â and maybe even looking for them to fail â a win would do much to wrestle back control of that narrative.

It has been recently reported that A dog that went missing for 36 days is thought to have covered about 100 miles (161km) - including swimming to an island before being rescued on her return.

Amber was being cared for by a foster family near Bramshaw, in the New Forest, when she escaped after just a night there on 25 April.

The retriever cross, who was rescued as a street puppy in Qatar by a charity and moved to the UK, is thought to have swam to Brownsea Island.

The charity's co-founder said she hoped adventurous Amber would have a "calmer, more stable spirit" in future in her forever home.

Amber was regularly spotted on her trip across Hampshire and Dorset but Kelly Parker, who set up KS Angels Rescue, said the dog had entered a "wild mindset" until Saturday's rescue.

"We had a lot of well-meaning people and they really did try to help," she said.

"Unfortunately with a dog that is scared and has entered that wild mindset, with any people, she would have run."

Every time she was spotted, Amber would have covered another five or six miles (8km or 9.6km), she added.

"It's been frustrating, we've felt like we were always behind her. It's definitely been an experience I would rather not have again â€“ but a happy ending." 

Amber was fed by one of Brownsea Island's few residents after she managed to make it to the island - but left after just a few days. 

She was spotted by two men in a boat in Poole Harbour and they rescued her before alerting Lost Dog Recovery, which had helped the search for her.

Jess Wadsworth, who had been looking after Amber before she scarpered, said Amber's disappearance had left her family anxious for weeks.

"I still can't quite believe [Amber is back]," she said.

"We've lost a pet dog for two or three days. You think in those terms. I have never known a dog that travels that many miles and survives.

"She's already in really good nick compared to how long she had gone for. What a girl."

But she said Amber was being carefully watched to ensure she does not make another swift escape.

Let's dive into the details: The chancellor's Spending Review, and a pledge to invest £39bn in affordable housing, features on many front pages. 

The Daily Mirror says Rachel Reeves wants "hundreds of thousands" of new homes to be built to "turn the tide" on the housing crisis. 

The i newspaper says the pledge is being seen as a "win" for Deputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary Angela Rayner.

The Times believes the NHS will be in line for a £30bn boost in the review, but says the health service will still not come close to hitting Sir Keir Starmer's waiting list target. 

The Daily Mail says figures showing a fall in the number of job vacancies have made a "mockery" of the chancellor's claims to have fixed the foundations of the economy.

The Daily Express leads on a call for Reeves to perform another U-turn and reverse the inheritance tax changes for farmers.

For the Financial Times, the Spending Review will be a "defining moment", both for Sir Keir Starmer's government and for the position of the chancellor. 

It says polls suggest Reeves is wallowing in an "abyss of unpopularity" previously preserved for the Conservative chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, and his mini-budget.

Elsewhere, the decision of the UK to place sanctions on two far-right Israeli cabinet ministers is the lead for the Guardian. 

The Telegraph returns to the UK government's deal with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands. 

It reports that the Mauritian government has said it will use almost £500m of the money to pay off its national debt, allowing it to abolish income tax for many of its residents.

The Irish News says petrol bombs, fireworks and masonry were thrown at police during a second night of violence in Ballymena. 

According to the Belfast Telegraph, some Filipino workers living in the area have put stickers on their doors to declare their nationality in an attempt to avoid being targeted in the unrest.

And the Sun reports that the Red Arrows are running out of planes. The paper says the legendary RAF team have 13 working jets and may be down to six by 2028 which would end their trademark "diamond nine" formation. "Anyone got a spare jet?" asks the paper.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Quincy Promes joined Dubai United in 2024

Former Ajax winger Quincy Promes has been extradited to the Netherlands, where he will serve a seven-and-a-half year prison sentence for drug trafficking and aggravated assault. 

The 33-year-old was arrested in Dubai last week following a request by the Dutch police.

Promes, capped 50 times for the Netherlands, was sentenced to six years in jail in February 2024 for his part in smuggling more than a tonne of cocaine into the Netherlands from Belgium in 2020. 

He had previously been sentenced to 18 months in prison for stabbing his cousin in the knee at a family gathering in 2020 but is yet to serve any time in prison for either of the crimes. 

A spokesperson for the prosecutors has confirmed that the Dutchman has now returned to the Netherlands. 

Promes denies the charges and has filed appeals in both cases. 

Promes made his senior debut for Twente in 2009 and spent three years at the club before earning the first of his two stints with Russian side Spartak Moscow.

After four years in the Russian capital, Promes joined Sevilla in La Liga but spent just one year in Spain before returning to the Netherlands with Ajax. 

He re-joined Spartak Moscow in 2021, spending a further three years in Russia before a move to Dubai United in 2024.

The first of Promes' 50 caps for the national side came in 2014, with the winger netting seven goals in that time. His last cap was in 2023. 

It is yet to be determined where Promes will serve his sentence in the Netherlands.

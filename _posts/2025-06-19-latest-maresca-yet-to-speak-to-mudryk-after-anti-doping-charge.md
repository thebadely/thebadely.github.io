Let's dive into the details: Mykhailo Mudryk has not played for Chelsea since November

Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca says he has yet to speak to Mykhailo Mudryk since the forward was charged with violating the Football Association's anti-doping rules but insists the player retains the club's support. 

Ukraine international Mudryk, 24, was provisionally suspended by the FA in December after an "adverse finding in a routine urine test" and now faces a potential four-year ban.

Mudryk, who at the time of his suspension said he was in "complete shock" and had "never knowingly used any banned substances", last played for Chelsea in November but attended the Blues' Uefa Conference League final win in Poland last month in a private capacity.

"Mischa is a Chelsea player and - as a Chelsea player - I trust all the Chelsea players," said Maresca. 

"I spoke with Mischa at the Conference League final in Poland but I haven't spoken to him since. 

"When I spoke to him he was quite good, I didn't see him worried or not good, he was good and okay but I haven't spoken to him since that day so I don't know how he is now."

Chelsea signed Mudryk from Shakhtar Donetsk in January 2023 in a deal worth up to Â£89m, and he is under contract at the club until June 2031.

Mudryk, who cannot currently train with the club, has scored 10 goals in 73 appearances in all competitions for the Blues.

Star attacker Cole Palmer has taken Mudryk's number 10 shirt and wore it for the first time in Chelsea's 2-0 win over Los Angeles FC at the Club World Cup. 

Speaking on Thursday at the club's training base at Subaru Park, home to MLS side Philadelphia Union, Palmer said he had not yet spoken to his team-mate but "will when the time is right".

Asked why he had wanted to wear the number 10 shirt, 23-year-old Palmer said it was to emulate his footballing idols.

"I wore number 10 all my life growing up and I just like the number," he said. 

"It is an iconic number, which makes me think of Messi and Rooney."

When in Manchester City's academy, Palmer sent a private message to Belgium winger Eden Hazard, a former wearer of the number 10 shirt at Chelsea, but did not receive a response. 

Palmer said Hazard still hasn't replied to his message but added: "I have met him a few times at the training ground. He asked me for one of his shirts from his sons." 

Meanwhile, Maresca said he will rotate "three, four or five players in every game", with his team next  facing Brazilian giants Flamengo at Lincoln Financial Field.

He added that  he expects winger Noni Madueke to remain at the club despite links to Arsenal.

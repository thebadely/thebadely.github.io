Here’s what you need to know: The Guardian says the US has warned that there could be more strikes on Islamic State targets in Nigeria, in what President Donald Trump has characterised as efforts to stop the killing of Christians.

The Daily Mirror accuses him of playing to Christian Maga fans and speculates that most of the victims of violence in the country are probably Muslims. But Christian leaders in Nigeria have told the Daily Telegraph that they are being murdered for their religion and the Nigerian government is in denial by rejecting Trump's assertion.

The Times says both King Charles III and the Prince of Wales are highly likely to visit the US next year as part of a charm offensive to "woo" Trump. The paper notes that the visits come as discussions continue between the UK and the US over formalising a trade deal.

The Daily Telegraph highlights figures suggesting that the UK has double the proportion of foreign doctors and nurses compared with the Western average. The paper quotes the Conservatives as saying the UK must prioritise domestic talent in order to secure the future of the NHS.

But the Guardian carries apparently contradictory warnings that foreign doctors and nurses are increasingly shunning the NHS because of anti-migrant rhetoric. A leading medic tells the paper that without their contribution, the NHS "could quite easily fall over".

The Financial Times says the Treasury will be putting aside £800m to insure the Bayeux Tapestry when it goes on display in the UK next year. The Times says the 70-metre long depiction of the Norman conquest is expected to be the British Museum's biggest ever exhibition.

"Cha-cha Charles beats Strictly" is how the Sun headlines its report on the Christmas TV viewing figures, as it notes that the King's annual broadcast topped the list, followed by the animation The Scarecrow's Wedding, with the Strictly Come Dancing Christmas special in third place.

The i Paper says eight million fewer people watched the BBC's top rated show than last year, when Gavin and Stacey topped the list.

The Daily Express says families are moving away from traditional viewing in favour of terrestrial TV's streaming rivals.

The biggest shock for the Daily Mail is that with 2.8 million viewers, even the BBC Weather forecast outperformed ITV's highest rated show, the 1% Club.

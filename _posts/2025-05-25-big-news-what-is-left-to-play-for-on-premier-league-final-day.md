Experts revealed that Liverpool's name has been etched on the Premier League trophy

The Premier League title race ended some time ago. So, too, was the battle to avoid relegation.

In fact, in truth there was no race and no battle.

So the focus is now on the hunt for European places - with spots in all three Uefa tournaments still up in the air.

There are also awards up for grabs - and emotional farewells. And the battle for 17th. No actually, that's not a real thing.

BBC Sport looks at what to keep an eye out for on the final day - with all the games kicking off at 16:00 BST on Sunday.

Third to fifth place will join Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham in qualifying for the Champions League, sixth is a Europa League spot, while seventh and eighth remain unclear

On the final day of the season, seven teams' European fate is still unclear.

Five teams are battling it out for three remaining Champions League places - while there are an uncertain amount of slots in the Europa League and possibly the Conference League available too.

Manchester City, Newcastle United and Chelsea occupy the top five - so know a win will take them to the Champions League, barring an unlikely goal difference swing. A draw will be enough for City at Fulham, other than in an unlikely goal difference scenario.

Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest need other results to go their way to squeeze in.

But the twist is that seventh-placed Forest host Chelsea, who are fifth - so if they win that, then the Blues are out unless they get lucky with goal difference.

Whoever finishes sixth will be guaranteed at least a Europa League spot - while Newcastle have a minimum of a Conference League spot in the bank from winning the Carabao Cup.

Brighton and Brentford are still hoping to sneak into a Conference League spot. Albion just need a point to finish eighth but the Bees would finish above them with a win, if Brighton lose.

But... that will only be enough if Chelsea finish outside the European places - so either seventh place (or sixth and Newcastle are seventh) and win Wednesday's Conference League final against Real Betis.

There are only things that could happen with Europa and Conference League spots but life is too short...

Champions Liverpool, second-placed Arsenal and 17th-placed Tottenham - as Europa League winners - are already sure of Champions League places.

FA Cup winners Crystal Palace are in the Europa League.

Which teams have qualified for the 2025-26 Champions League?

How can finishing eighth get into Europe? 

Fulham v Manchester City

Manchester United v Aston Villa

Newcastle v Everton

Nottingham Forest v Chelsea

Tottenham v Brighton

Wolves v Brentford

At one stage it looked as if Liverpool's Mohamed Salah could be breaking goal records this season.

He had scored 27 goals in the first 28 league games - which had him on course to break Erling Haaland's 36-goal record from two seasons ago.

But since then he has only netted once, although he is practically certain to land his fourth Premier League Golden Boot, taking him level with Thierry Henry's record.

He is five goals clear of Newcastle striker Alexander Isak with one game left.

There is another less-known record he could clinch - most goal involvements in a Premier League season.

He is one off the record of goal contributions - a player's goals plus assists total - in a Premier League season, with a home game against Crystal Palace to come.

He has 28 goals and 18 assists, one behind Alan Shearer and Andrew Cole's 34-goal and 13-assist seasons.

Salah is two goals off the assist record of 20 by Arsenal's Henry and Manchester City's Kevin de Bruyne.

He also has an outside chance of winning his first European Golden Shoe, for the top scorer in any of Europe's top flights (with weighting added to the tougher leagues).

Salah would need four goals to overtake Real Madrid striker Kylian Mbappe, who scored twice in his last game of the season on Saturday.

Whatever happens, Salah will get his hand on one trophy after the game - the Premier League trophy which the Reds will be presented with.

Who will win the European Golden Shoe?

Wait goes on as Salah bids to break Premier League records

David Raya is looking for his second consecutive Golden Glove

The battle for the Golden Glove, a trophy that nobody ever mentioned a few years ago, is between two men.

Nottingham Forest's Matz Sels and Arsenal's David Raya are the pair left standing in the race for the most Premier League clean sheets.

They are on 13 each, meaning they will share it if they either both keep clean sheets or concede goals this weekend.

Raya won it last year with 16 clean sheets.

In fact this year could end up as the fewest clean sheets required to win it, with the record Joe Hart's 14 in 2014-15.

Southampton have already avoided the much-publicised indignity of being the worst team in Premier League history after picking up a 12th point a couple of weeks ago.

Derby's 11-point tally of 2007-08 remains a record akin to Usain Bolt's 9.58-second 100m run. It could stand for a long time.

But Southampton's wretched season could still be capped with another miserable record.

If the Saints lose at home to Arsenal on Sunday, it will be an unprecedented 30th league defeat in a Premier League campaign.

They share the record of 29 with Ipswich Town (1994-95), Sunderland (2005-06), that Derby team and Sheffield United (2020-21).

Fans celebrate Europa League win at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium

Tottenham fans will not be too bothered by any of this as they continue to celebrate Wednesday's Europa League win over Manchester United in Bilbao.

But they could make history as the lowest finishers in a league to win a European trophy.

Spurs sit 17th, one place behind United, with neither yet on 40 points.

Relegation was never really a worry with the bottom three so far adrift - although their points totals would have taken them down in four different Premier League seasons.

If Tottenham finish below 14th, that will be the lowest position for a European winner ever. If they get up to 14th, they will equal West Ham's record from the 2022-23 Conference League campaign.

Will Liverpool boss Arne Slot give Trent Alexander-Arnold one last game?

Several players will be making their final appearances for their clubs, with the most noteworthy being Liverpool's Real Madrid-bound right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold.

And that is if Arne Slot decides to play him at home against Crystal Palace after he was booed on his last Anfield appearance.

Manchester City legend De Bruyne will also say farewell to the club where he has won so many trophies. He has indicated he is unlikely to hang around until the Fifa Club World Cup in case he gets injured and cannot find a new club.

Jack Grealish could be on his way out of City too, according to reports.

Kieran Tierney will leave Arsenal to rejoin Celtic, with Jorginho also expected to make his farewell.

Crystal Palace captain Joel Ward is leaving the club after 364 games over 13 years.

West Ham have four experienced players leaving - Aaron Cresswell, Lukasz Fabianski, Danny Ings and Vladimir Coufal. And Ashley Young and Abdoulaye Doucoure are on their way out of Everton.

Dean Huijsen will say goodbye to Bournemouth on Sunday, after one season at the club, before moving to Real Madrid for Â£50m. Team-mate Milos Kerkez is being strongly linked to Liverpool.

Even the most optimistic Ipswich fan could not hope Liam Delap will stay in the Championship.

Ben Mee is exiting Brentford, although will not play. In the opposite of a farewell (a hello), Aaron Hickey will be in the Bees' matchday squad for the first time since October 2023.

Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez caused a lot of speculation last weekend when he appeared to be in tears after their final home game of the season. Is he Saudi Arabia bound?

No managers are confirmed to be leaving this summer, although Spurs' Ange Postecoglou - despite ending their 17-year trophy drought - and Leicester's Ruud van Nistelrooy are the most likely candidates to exit.

It has been recently reported that Steve Tandy is preparing for his first Six Nations game in charge

Wales head coach Steve Tandy says he wants to savour the "unbelievable experience" of winning at Twickenham's Allianz Stadium again as Wales bid to shock England in their Six Nations opener.

Wales are huge underdogs on Saturday having not won a Six Nations game since March 2023, while Steve Borthwick's England have won 11 games in a row.

Tandy has fond memories of Twickenham from his time as Scotland defence coach and being part of famous Six Nations victories in 2021 and 2023.

"Winning at Twickenham, at such an iconic stadium, is incredible," said Tandy.

"It's an unbelievable experience and the best thing is when you see what joy it brings to outside the dressing room as well."

Returning prop Tomas Francis is the only member of the Wales playing squad who has beaten England at Twickenham, in the 2015 World Cup success.

Backroom staff members Martyn Williams, Huw Bennett, Dan Lydiate and Duncan Jones, who suffered a "freak injury" in an accidental collision during a training session, have also experienced an away win against England.

"For our group I know intimidating and daunting are words which people will throw out which is understandable," said Tandy.

"We have to be excited about how we can go and attack this game."

Tandy knows Wales secured only two victories in their past 23 Tests overall.

The 21 defeats include a record 18-Test losing run and record home losses against England (68-14), Argentina (52-28) and South Africa (73-0).

Wales have not won a Six Nations match since beating Italy in Rome almost three years ago.

The record of 11 successive tournament defeats has resulted in two winless tournaments in which they have picked up consecutive Wooden Spoons for finishing bottom.

In contrast, England are ranked third in the world.

"Internally the boys believe in what we are trying to do," said Tandy.

"Outside of it why would people give us a chance, realistically?

"You look at the form of both teams, you probably wouldn't. But ultimately the only thing we are genuinely focusing on is ourselves, it isn't about the outside noise or influence.

"I know people will write us off but ultimately when we come out of this game on Saturday we want to look ourselves in the mirror and show we have improved since the autumn."

'I've never doubted the mental resilience of this group'

Tandy is looking forward to his opening Six Nations game in charge of his home country.

"The Six Nations is the biggest tournament in the world outside of the World Cup and we are fortunate to be a part of it," said Tandy.

"I feel grateful to have an opportunity to represent your country in the tournament.

"It will be amazing, I feel so privileged to have these opportunities. I know my girls are fired up as well.

"There will no doubt be nerves but I want the boys to go out there and represent themselves to the best they can. 

"I am privileged to coach these players, they are incredible to work with."

Wales have been preparing for the game with the backdrop of the latest Welsh rugby crisis off the field, with the future of the Ospreys in doubt.

There are four players involved in Wales' 23-man squad with captain Dewi Lake joined by Dan Edwards, Kieran Hardy and Harri Deaves.

"The turmoil has been there for a while," said Tandy.

"Our boys have been outstanding and it is testament to them as people.

"You can get away a little bit from that outside noise but they've been so focused on the game and how we want to grow our team.

"So I don't think they've had too much of a distraction. In a weird way, it does focus in more of the day-to-day and getting us better for Saturday."

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Social housing in the Borders have been fitted with a new power storage system designed to reduce the properties' energy bills by as much as 85%.

Eleven homes have had the systems installed as part of a trial involving Scottish Borders Housing Association.

Energy firm Knight PowerHub said the solar panels, and batteries used for storing the energy, had a longer operational life than previously available.

Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes visited the Galashiels home of Muriel Allison, one of the residents using the new system. Forbes said Ms Allison had already seen a fall in her costs.

Kight PowerHub said it hoped the systems could be mass manufactured in the south of Scotland soon.

If the pilot provides the expected savings, the scheme could be rolled out to other areas in coming years.

Founder Lawrence Fagg said: "We're proud to start here in Galashiels, and even prouder to know this system could potentially help thousands more pensioners and families across Scotland."

It has taken five years of research and development ahead of the social housing pilot starting this month.

By using artificial intelligence (AI) within the systems, time dependent tariffs are automatically triggered to keep bills to a minimum.

Julia Mulloy, chief executive of Scottish Borders Housing Association, said: "It's a pioneering project which is not just about technology, it's about people."

He said there was potential to reduce fuel poverty and carbon emissions.

According to new developments, Jon Rahm (2023 Masters), Bryson DeChambeau (2024 US Open) and Cam Smith (2022 Open Championship) are recent major winners

Jon Rahm, Bryson DeChambeau and Cam Smith have all indicated they will remain with LIV Golf rather than rejoining the PGA Tour.

Five-time major winner Brooks Koepka was recently accepted back on the American circuit after he quit the Saudi Arabian-backed series to prioritise "the needs of his family". 

The PGA Tour subsequently opened the door for fellow major winners Rahm, DeChambeau and Smith to follow Koepka under a new returning member programme, open until 2 February.

But the trio have since quashed the prospect of a return at a news conference for LIV Golf captains.

Rahm, 31, said he "wished Brooks the best" but was "not planning to go anywhere".

 "As far as I'm concerned, I'm focused on LIV for this year and hoping my team can repeat as champs," said the Spaniard.

American DeChambeau said he was "contracted through 2026" and "was so excited about this year" while fellow 32-year-old Smith of Australia added that he had "made a decision" and will "be on LIV for years to come".

Only players who have been away from the PGA Tour for at least two years and have won The Players Championship or a major between 2022-25 were eligible to return under the terms of the PGA Tour initiative.

That meant Rahm, DeChambeau and Smith were the only LIV players able to consider a move, with Phil Mickelson ruled out because he won the last of his six majors at the 2021 US PGA Championship.

PGA Tour chief executive Brian Rolapp outlined that programme would be only open for the 2026 campaign and was in "response to a unique set of circumstances".

"This is a one-time, defined window and does not set a precedent for future situations," Rolapp said in an open letter.

"Once the door closes, there is no promise that this path will be available again."

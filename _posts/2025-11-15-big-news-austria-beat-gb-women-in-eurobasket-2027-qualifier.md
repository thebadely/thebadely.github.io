It has been recently reported that GB's Temi Fagbenle plays for WNBA side Golden State Valkyries

Great Britain's women fell to a 85-81 defeat by Austria in EuroBasket 2027 qualifying in Vienna.

In the second of six group D games, Temi Fagbenle scored 22 points for GB, one shy of Austria's game leader Sina Elke Hollerl, while Holly Warburton posted 18 in a tight encounter which had 16 lead changes.

The visitors trailed 16-14 at the end of the first quarter but, by half-time, had stolen the advantage and led by one point. 

The sides stayed within touching distance after the break, but Great Britain could not prevent the hosts from taking victory, leaving Austria top of the group.

Britain will complete this round of qualifiers against Norway in Bergen on Tuesday, before return legs are contested in March. 

After all teams have played each other twice, the top two of each group will progress to the second qualifying round, along with the three best-performing third-placed teams from the seven groups. 

EuroBasket 2027 will be co-hosted by Belgium, Sweden, Finland and Lithuania in June 2027.

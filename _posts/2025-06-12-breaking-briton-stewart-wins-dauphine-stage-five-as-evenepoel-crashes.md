Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Stewart is one of a number of fast-finishing British riders currently on the World Tour

Britain's Jake Stewart won his first World Tour race with victory on stage five of the Criterium du Dauphine after a bunch sprint.

Israel-Premier Tech's Stewart beat stage hot favourite Jonathan Milan of Lidl-Trek by launching his effort early and getting a jump on the Italian.

Milan's huge power was not enough to claw back Stewart, whose timing was perfect for what was a tailwind ride to the finish line in Macon after a 183km stage.

Overall race leader Remco Evenepoel of Belgium crashed in the peloton with 500m to go, ripping the material on the right shoulder of his leader's yellow jersey, but he appeared uninjured and was able to continue. He later said there were "no major injuries, just small scratches".

Evenepoel, of Soudal-Quick Step, remains in the overall lead because of a new 5km rule introduced this season which awards all riders with the same time if there is a crash within the allocated distance.

There is also a longstanding 3km rule which is applied, usually for the flattest sprint stages.

"That feels good," said Stewart. "It's such a shame Pascal [Ackermann, his team-mate] crashed [earlier in the stage and abandoned] and they handed over to me.

"The team and the boys backed me and I'm so happy I could finish it off for them."

When asked about his new prototype bike which has caused interest in the paddock for its aerodynamic front fork design, Stewart replied: "I'm not allowed to say too much about that."

Stewart is expected to take part in next month's Tour de France.

The Dauphine, which takes place across the region of the same name in south-east France, is the traditional warm-up for the Tour.

Only four times in the past 10 editions has the overall winner gone on to be victorious in the Tour.

The eight-day stage race now moves into the high mountains in the French Alps, with Friday's 126.7km race to Combloux.

Saturday's stage is likely to feature the most explosive action, with three hugely steep hors category climbs in the French Alps to Valmeinier.

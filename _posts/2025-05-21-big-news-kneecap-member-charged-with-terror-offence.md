It has been recently reported that A member of Irish language hip-hop group Kneecap has been charged with a terror offence after allegedly displaying a flag in support of proscribed organisation Hezbollah at a London gig.

Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, 27, has been charged by the Metropolitan Police after an incident on 21 November 2024 at the O2 Forum in Kentish Town, London.

Mr Ó hAnnaidh, who performs under the name Mo Chara, is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday 18 June.

Officers from the Met's counter terrorism command were made aware on 22 April of an online video from the event.

Belfast man Mr Ó hAnnaidh has been charged under the name Liam O'Hanna.

An investigation was carried out, which led to the Crown Prosecution Service authorising charge.

Earlier this month, the Met said it would investigate online videos allegedly showing the group calling for the death of British MPs and shouting "up Hamas, up Hezbollah".

Both Hamas and Hezbollah are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.

Hezbollah is a Shia Muslim political and military group in Lebanon which has been involved in a series of violent conflicts.

Kneecap say they have never supported Hamas or Hezbollah and would not incite violence against any individual. They say the video in question has been taken out of context.

A number of gigs featuring the band have been called off since the videos emerged.

They are currently scheduled to headline Wide Awake festival in Brockwell Park, south London, on Friday.

Kneecap are an Irish-speaking rap trio who have courted controversy with their provocative lyrics and merchandise.

The group was formed in 2017 by three friends who go by the stage names of Mo Chara, Móglaí Bap and DJ Próvaí.

Their rise to fame inspired a semi-fictionalised film starring Oscar-nominated actor Michael Fassbender.

The film won a British Academy of Film Award (Bafta) in February 2025.

In April, the group faced criticism and commercial consequences after displaying messages about the war in Gaza during their set at US music festival Coachella last month.

They were dropped by their sponsor and booking agent Independent Artist Group (IAG) and former X Factor judge Sharon Osbourne called for Kneecap's US work visas to be revoked.

Following this, footage emerged from previous gigs, which were investigation by counter-terrorism officers.

Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch shared one of the videos and renewed her criticism of the Labour government for last year settling a legal case brought by the group.

It related to a decision Badenoch made when she was a minister to withdraw an arts grant.

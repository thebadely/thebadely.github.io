Former cycling star Bradley Wiggins, who recently made headlines after speaking about his post-career cocaine addiction, tells BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast's Rick Edwards he "couldn't care less what the newspapers want to sensationalise".

He said after his career ended, he "suddenly had to deal with things that people normally take a lot of time to deal with", referring to his father's death and sexual abuse he experienced as a teenager.

It has been recently reported that Sheffield Wednesday fans boycotted home EFL Cup ties against Leeds and Grimsby

Sheffield Wednesday will "imminently" be served with a winding-up petition over money owed to HMRC.

After an investigation conducted by BBC Radio Sheffield alongside the Sheffield Star, it is understood the Championship club owes Â£1m.

A winding-up petition would increase the pressure on the club's owner Dejphon Chansiri to sell.

They are already under five separate EFL embargoes after failing to pay wages on time in five of the past seven months.

The BBC has contacted Sheffield Wednesday for comment.

Wednesday are second bottom of the Championship with six points from nine games after a torrid period off the field, which has left them with a threadbare squad.

The severity of the situation became apparent when May's wages were not paid on time, in the wake of the same thing happening in March.

With uncertainty ongoing and the club placed under various registration embargoes, highly-rated manager Danny Rohl departed in July and his assistant Henrik Pedersen took charge 10 days before the season started.

The team did not play a single pre-season friendly in front of fans and players pulled out of a training match against Burnley after July's wages were not paid.

Fans have organised protests before and during games so far this season and they boycotted the home EFL Cup ties with Leeds and Grimsby, while the supporters' trust also encouraged fans not to buy drinks or snacks in the stadium.

Thai businessman Chansiri, who has owned the club for the past 10 years, has been absent for the entire period and, as yet, no sale has been close.

The Owls visit Charlton on Saturday looking for a second league win of the season.

After the turmoil of the previous months, boss Pedersen does not think the reports about a potential winding-up petition will negatively impact the players.

"I heard about it and of course it's not good but let's see what happens before I say anything," Pedersen told BBC Radio Sheffield.

"I have been in contact with the chairman this week but not about this.

"There has been a lot [going on] for a long time and we are really well trained to have focus on what we can control. 

"There has been a great atmosphere in the training. The boys, the staff and the coaches do really well to put things away."

Analysis - Rob Staton, BBC Radio Sheffield reporter

For the last week we've been working on this story alongside the Sheffield Star. It isn't a surprise and has been on the cards.

So what does it mean? A winding-up petition is a formal court application, filed by a creditor, to force an insolvent company into compulsory liquidation. With HMRC owed Â£1m they are believed to be ready to take that step.

It could mean administration for the club, although that is not guaranteed, but it also means a distinct possibility that Chansiri's time at Sheffield Wednesday is close to coming to an end.

What the future holds is unclear and no fan will rejoice at the words "liquidation" being brought up. But it could mean the opportunity for a fresh start.

Short-term pain for long-term gain, that must be the hope.

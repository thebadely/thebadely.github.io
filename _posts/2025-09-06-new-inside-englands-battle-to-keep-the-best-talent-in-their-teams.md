It has been recently reported that A large number of England players are eligible to represent another country

When England take to the pitch against Andorra at Villa Park on Saturday, they will not be the only team of English players on the grass.

Dotted around the pitch will be the England Under-15 team who are going to be the ball boys for the game - and the reason they will be there is because of long-term planning by the Football Association (FA).

It is something that has been done for the past few years so the FA can give the youngsters an added interest in playing for England and help them stay in the pathway to the national team in the competitive era of players who have eligibility for more than one country. 

The reason the U15s are being invited to have such a role is so that they can feel part of the England set-up in an international window when they will not be playing a match.

They will be strategically put around the pitch close to their actual positions so they can learn from the England senior player who plays in their role.

Some of England's key players who could have represented other nations include Harry Kane (Republic of Ireland), Bukayo Saka (Nigeria), Jude Bellingham (Republic of Ireland), Cole Palmer (St Kitts and Nevis) and Marc Guehi (Ivory Coast).

England might start two midfielders on Saturday who could have played for another country, in Elliot Anderson and Declan Rice, with the latter playing three international friendlies for the Republic of Ireland senior team in 2018.

Anderson was called up to the senior Scotland squad two years ago to play England but withdrew to give himself some more thinking time about his international future.

In 2019, Dan Ashworth, who was then FA's director of elite development before becoming its chief football officer, said: "Of 75 under-15s on our radar, 55 are eligible for more than one country."

It is now thought that around 75% of the players in the England pathway can play for at least two nations as the battle for young talent heats up across club and international level.

Anderson had played for Scotland at youth levels but had impressed the England set-up with then senior manager Gareth Southgate speaking about his potential.

It does not always fall England's way though with Michael Olise, now a France international, being tracked by England and Bayern Munich and Germany midfielder Jamal Musiala playing for England up to U21 level.

Alongside the experience the U15 players will have as ball boys, they are going to receive talks from former England internationals Andy Johnson and Dion Dublin with technical director John McDermott also expected to speak.

Players come to the FA's attention at U13 level when they start playing tournaments with their club's academies. This season's breakout youngsters Max Dowman, at Arsenal, and Rio Ngumoha from Liverpool, both came to the attention of England coaches from that age.

Other nations who know about players with dual nationality are also acting, by setting up training camps in the UK to allow the youngsters to show their talent and get a feel for a new national set-up without the travel usually involved.

The Unity Cup was held at Brentford's stadium and involved Jamaica, Ghana, Nigeria and Trinidad and Tobago. It was an example of national sides coming to the UK, providing an opportunity for them to attract dual nationality players.

That is why the FA has always tried to make the experience around playing for England one to remember.

The videos that the FA posts to its social media channels of the players reporting for England duty have become a staple part of the international break and have a cult group of online watchers.

In September of last year, Rico Lewis said that, alongside representing the Three Lions, he also imagined himself being in one of those arrival videos posted to YouTube.

There are also the young players who are drafted into the senior training sessions to make the numbers up.

One of the reasons the FA has put so much effort into transforming and creating St George's Park is that it wants all of the teams in the England pathway on one site.

It is how a number of players have gone on to make their England senior debuts, with England U21 players called across to the senior squad after an injury or withdrawal.

Just this week, Law McCabe on loan to Plymouth from Middlesbrough and Zach Abbott at Nottingham Forest, were called up to train with the England senior side from the U20s.

It is mostly a case of adding extra numbers in training but it is another thing young players can be aspirational about.

And that chance, however small, of having the opportunity to train with the senior squad may be the difference in keeping the young players engaged with England.

Success on the pitch and a patriotic feeling is the ultimate decision maker for most players but having the opportunity to get life-changing experiences can help as England look to secure their next generation of stars.

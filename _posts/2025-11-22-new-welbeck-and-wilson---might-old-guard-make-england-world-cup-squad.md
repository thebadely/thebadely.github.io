Experts revealed that Danny Welbeck and Callum Wilson are among the leading English scorers in the Premier League this season

England manager Thomas Tuchel might have a selection headache, but perhaps not from where he expected it to come from.

While conversations about England's World Cup squad largely revolve around younger players, two Premier League veterans continue to make a compelling case to be back-up to Harry Kane next summer. 

Danny Welbeck and Callum Wilson have drifted to the periphery of the international stage in recent years - but that narrative might be about to change.

Welbeck, who will turn 35 on Wednesday, netted his seventh league goal in as many matches as Brighton came from behind to beat Brentford 2-1 on Saturday. 

Meanwhile, at Bournemouth, Wilson scored twice for West Ham in an entertaining 2-2 draw. 

That took the 33-year-old striker to three goals in two games and four for the season since signing for the Hammers as a free agent in the summer. 

It was further proof the experienced duo are knocking on Tuchel's door with only one more international break to go before the German names his squad for the 2026 World Cup.

Wilson has done it before. 

Having not featured for England since October 2019, the then Newcastle striker forced his way into Gareth Southgate's 2022 World Cup squad.

Wilson had scored six goals in 10 league games at the start of the 2022-23 season to join Kane as the Three Lions' main striker options in Qatar.

He went on to make just two substitute appearances in the group stage and has not won a cap since September 2023. 

But with Wilson seemingly back at his best with another impressive display at Bournemouth, former England goalkeeper Rob Green has tipped the striker to make an England return. 

Though Djordje Petrovic's goalkeeping for Wilson's first goal left a great deal to be desired, the striker's improvised finish for the second gave the Bournemouth keeper no chance. 

"Callum Wilson was at his clinical best," Green told BBC Match of the Day. 

"He had two chances and scored two very good goals. If he stays in this kind of form there's nothing to stop him starting for West Ham for the rest of the season if he can keep fit. And England don't have a lot of options at number nine."

Wilson left Newcastle last summer at the end of his contract and rejected approaches from Saudi Arabia to sign for the Hammers. 

He has now started three consecutive games for West Ham with his three goals helping the struggling side earn seven points in their bid to climb out of the Premier League relegation zone. 

Asked about his England chances after the Bournemouth draw, Wilson told BBC Final Score: "For me, of course any player would never say no. 

"I just need to keep my shirt at west Ham and improve, and then six months down the line who knows what may happen."

A series of injuries meant Wilson only started 71 of 190 league matches during his Newcastle spell, but if he can remain injury-free he could well improve his chances of playing in the World Cup next summer. 

Danny Welbeck last played for England in a friendly win over Switzerland in 2018

Welbeck, meanwhile, is enjoying a renaissance at Brighton and manager Fabian Hurzeler perfectly summed up the forward's form after the win against Brentford. 

"He is like a good red wine," Hurzeler told BBC Match of the Day.

"The older he gets, the better he gets - and we are very pleased to have him in our squad as a leader, as a player, as a personality."

Welbeck is the leading English scorer in the top flight this season with seven goals, with Wilson and Burnley's Jaidon Anthony next with four.

Injuries have disrupted Welbeck's career and prevented him from adding to his 42 England caps and 16 goals, with his most recent appearance in September 2018.

"Unfortunately for me in my career I have had some pretty horrible injuries and things that have kept me out for a long time," Welbeck told Sky Sports. 

"I'm just happy to be out there on the pitch, enjoying my football and staying fit."

His strong start to the season had former players, including Wayne Rooney, suggesting Tuchel should consider him for an England recall for November's World Cup qualifiers. 

Welbeck was not included in the squad for the games against Serbia and Albania, but the Brighton forward says he is not thinking about the World Cup at the moment. 

"I've just always remained never too high and never too low," he told Sky Sports.

"I just always go with the flow and make sure that I am prepared because football can change in an instant. 

"I take it game by game, week by week - [I turn] 35 this week on Wednesday but I'm feeling great. Hopefully they sing a little song for me and that's all I need at 35!"

With Tuchel saying he will contact every player in England's long list to lay out plans to improve their chances of making it to the World Cup, both Welbeck and Wilson will hope they will have a realistic path back into the international fold.

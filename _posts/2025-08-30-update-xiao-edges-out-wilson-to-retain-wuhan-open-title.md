According to new developments, Xiao's only previous ranking title came in the same event a year ago

China's Xiao Guodong beat England's Gary Wilson 10-9 to retain the Wuhan Open title.

Xiao, 36, won the tournament in 2024 and becomes just the fourth player to retain their maiden title after John Parrott, Mark Allen and beaten finalist Wilson.

"Winning a first ranking title is hard, winning a second is even harder," he said.

"To be able to come back to this city and successfully defend the title really means a lot. 

"As an experienced player, winning two ranking titles at this stage feels a bit late, but in another way the timing is just right."

Xiao had led 2-0 and 5-3 but Wilson went on to take the initiative in the evening session with three centuries in five frames, helping him to an 8-6 advantage.

China's world number 14 then clawed it back to lead 9-8 before Wilson responded with a break of 52 to set up a deciding frame.

Xiao held his nerve to seal the win in an edgy final frame, retaining his title and claiming the Â£140,000 top prize.

"My biggest gain over the past year has been growth in my mentality," Xiao added. 

"I'm calmer and more composed now. I feel much more settled and determined about the path I'm on. I just want to focus on every shot and enjoy what I do out there."

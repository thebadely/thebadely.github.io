It has been recently reported that Mariona Caldentey (left) and Olivia Smith (right) will both play for Arsenal in 2025-26

Arsenal midfielder Mariona Caldentey has been named the Professional Footballers' Association women's player of the year, with her new team-mate Olivia Smith awarded the young player award.

USA manager Emma Hayes won the PFA merit award in recognition of her contributions to women's football during an illustrious career with Chelsea.

Caldentey, 29, scored 19 goals in 41 appearances in all competitions in her first season with the Gunners, following a move from Barcelona, including nine goals and five assists in the Women's Super League (WSL).

The Spain midfielder said "there is nothing better than when your opponents recognise your job" after picking up her first PFA award. 

Caldentey told BBC Sport: "As a footballer, you want to win the trophies with the team and then when you are successful, this happens. 

"It feels nice but I want to win trophies with the club."

Arsenal team-mate Alessia Russo, Manchester City pair Mary Fowler and Yui Hasegawa, Chelsea's Erin Cuthbert and Manchester United's Phallon Tullis-Joyce were also on the shortlist.

Spain international Caldentey was named the WSL player of the year in May, an award that was voted for by supporters. 

Arsenal finished second in the WSL, behind champions Chelsea, but beat Barcelona 1-0 in the Champions League final with Caldentey playing the whole match.

Canada forward Smith said it "means the world to her" to become the first foreign player to win the award.

She told BBC Sport: "This genuinely means the world to me, knowing that no other foreigner has won this award. 

"Whenever I go home it's so cool to see the girls that are inspired by me, and being a role model they look up to is massive for me and a huge privilege. I want this to help other girls and boys."

Smith, 21, became the most expensive signing in women's football history when she completed a Â£1m move to the Gunners from Liverpool in July.

Smith made her international debut at 15 and joined Liverpool from Portuguese side Sporting a year ago for a club-record fee of just over Â£200,000.

She scored nine goals in 20 matches in the WSL before agreeing a move to Arsenal in July.

Also in the running for the PFA young player of the year award were Chelsea trio Aggie Beever-Jones, Maika Hamano and Weikie Kaptein; Manchester United midfielder Grace Clinton, who won the accolade in 2024; and Manchester City's Fowler.

Emma Hayes has won 21 of her 25 games in charge of USA women's national team

Hayes is widely regarded as one of the game's most influential coaches and was responsible for building a Chelsea dynasty that has seen them dominate English football for the past decade.

The 48-year-old, who spent 12 years in charge of the Blues, is a serial winner and led the club to 16 trophies, including seven WSL titles and five FA Cups.

She is also a six-time WSL manager of the season winner and has picked up the Best Fifa football coach award twice.

Since leaving Chelsea at the end of the 2023-24 season, Hayes has continued to enjoy success on the international stage with the USA, leading them to gold at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

Off the field, Hayes has been a spokesperson for women's health, advocating for research on menstrual cycle patterns, encouraging studies on the relationships between female footballers and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries, and pushing for education in nutrition.

The WSL team of the year, voted for by the players, was dominated by Champions League winners Arsenal, with four included. 

Emily Fox, Kim Little, Caldentey and Russo were named in the XI alongside Manchester United trio Tullis-Joyce, Maya le Tissier and Jayde Riviere.

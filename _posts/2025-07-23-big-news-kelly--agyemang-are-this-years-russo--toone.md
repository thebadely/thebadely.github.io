England make late comeback as Agyemang and Kelly send them to the final

"Kelly and Agyemang are this year's Russo and Toone."

A text from a BBC Sport user after England's dramatic Euro 2025 semi-final win over Italy summed it up perfectly.

En route to winning Euro 2022 three years ago, the Lionesses relied heavily on their super subs - particularly Alessia Russo and Ella Toone.

The duo both featured in all six games at that tournament, but neither of them started a match.

Toone came off the bench to score two goals - including one in the final - while Russo scored four - the most a substitute has ever registered in an edition of the Women's European Championship.

Fast forward to 2025 and there is a new double act making a name for themselves and propelling Sarina Wiegman's side to another major tournament final.

Arsenal forward Chloe Kelly has come off the bench in all of England's matches so far in Switzerland, while her Gunners teammate Michelle Agyemang has made three substitute appearances.

The pair were instrumental in England's progression to the semi-final, and again for the final.

Both came on in the quarter-final when England were 2-0 down to Sweden. Kelly provided the assist for Lucy Bronze's goal and playing a part in setting up the equaliser, scored by Agyemang in the 81st minute to force extra time. Kelly was also one of the three England players to score in the shootout as England reached the last four.

Five days later against Italy, England once again found themselves behind and  Wiegman had to turn to her bench - specifically Kelly and Agyemang - to save the day.

Teenager Agyemang kept England in the tournament and the 19-year-old equalised in the 96th minute of normal time to force extra time.

Then, with a minute left before a penalty shootout, Kelly found the bottom corner from the rebound after her penalty was saved to send the Lionesses into successive Euros finals.

Agyemang scores equaliser in final minutes to send England to extra-time

Agyemang was a headline inclusion in Wiegman's Euro 2025 squad, having made only one senior appearance before the tournament.

She made headlines on her debut in April, scoring just 41 seconds after being introduced against Belgium.

Asked if Agyemang could be a "wildcard" off the bench after naming her in the 23-player squad, Wiegman said: "Yeah I think so, I think so. We will see what she can bring.

"I have seen her in training sessions and what she did in Belgium - she can bring something different. I hope she can show that."

It's safe to say Agyemang showed Wiegman what she can do.

Her goal against Italy was her second in Switzerland, making her the first teenager to net twice at a Women's Euros since Cecilie Pedersen for Norway in 2009.

The 19-year-old says she doesn't know how she keeps saving England when they need it most.

"I don't know," she said after the game in Geneva. "It's by the grace of God. We are doing wonders as a team and I am so proud that I can say I'm a part of this team."

England captain Leah Williamson, who was replaced by her Arsenal team-mate Agyemang in the 85th minute said: "She feels inevitable right now.

"She is quality. What she brings, she is a nightmare to play against. I'm glad she is my teammate for club and country. She deserves her flowers, I hope she gets them, I hope she enjoys tonight and I hope she is ready to go at the weekend."

BBC Sport pundit Nedum Onuoha, who backed Agyemang to have a breakthrough tournament, added: "She's 19 years old in a European Championship semi-final and she played like she had been there tonnes of times like some of her team-mates.

"She is an absolute star."

Agyemang almost scored a second against Italy when she lobbed the goalkeeper and hit the crossbar minutes before Kelly's penalty.

"She nearly got the winner," England's record goalscorer Ellen White said.

"I think she is just a special, special player, a special human being. She plays beyond her years and has been absolutely phenomenal, what she's done with limited minutes, she's turned England's history on its head and helped them reach another final.

Kelly scores rebound after penalty saved to send England through

Kelly's winner against Italy in the 119th minute was the latest goal ever scored at a Women's Euros.

The forward - who signed permanently for Arsenal before Euro 2025 - said she considered taking a break from football earlier this year after a difficult spell with Manchester City.

She joined Arsenal on loan and earned a place back in Wiegman's England squad. Now she and the Lionesses are reaping the rewards.

"The moments in January when I felt like giving up football makes you so grateful for these moments here today and makes you enjoy every minute of that," Kelly said after the game.

Kelly, who famously scored the winning goal for England as they beat Germany at Wembley to beat Euro 2022, has "made a difference" in every game in Switzerland according to Bronze.

"She did it before the last Euros as well," Bronze said. "We forget she came back from an ACL injury but then she came off the bench and scored the winning goal in the Euros final.

"She has been doing it week in, week out and she's just got this attitude and this confidence that I don't think you can buy.

"She has not started any of the games but in every single game she's come on and made a difference. She's one of those players that you want on your team and not on the other team, that's for sure."

Kelly's penalty was initially saved by Laura Giuliani, but she drilled home the rebound to avoid another shootout.

"Thankfully Chloe Kelly had the composure to sprint and tuck it under the goalkeeper," England record goalscorer Ellen White told BBC Radio 5 Live. "To have the composure and still follow up.

"She's come to England's rescue, she's got that mentality to come on and make a huge difference."

Kelly has made the most substitute appearances in Women's Euros history (11)

In her post-match news conference, Wiegman was asked if Agyemang is forcing herself into her starting line-up for the final.

"She is not forcing me," Wiegman said. "She is very grateful to get minutes and she is very ready for it. Her growth and development went so quickly. From not starting at Brighton to getting lots more minutes and showing how good she is, to coming into our team. It went smooth for her and she feels very good about that."

Here is what BBC Sport readers think on whether Kelly and Agyemang deserve to start in Basel on 27 July.

Stephen: Please let's get the starting 11 right on Sunday - Kelly and Agyemang must start. And James just fades away in the pressure games.

Rich: Chloe Kelly is a big game player. Something always happens with her on the pitch. Should start ahead of James. Substitutions need to happen earlier. Managers think they are too clever by half sometimes.

Anon: Well our luck is still in but, I can't understand SW's substitutions. Kelly should have come on at half-time. And why were Agyemang and Beever-Jones put on so late?

Jas: They need start Kelly and Agyemang. This is the second time they made a difference.

Will: Agyemang should start in the final, she is exceptional.

Let's dive into the details: Two men have appeared in court charged with fraud following the collapse of a pre-paid funeral firm that left 46,000 customers out of pocket.

Richard Wells and Neil Debenham, former executives of Safe Hands, are both charged with conspiracy to defraud and fraud by false representation.

Safe Hands collapsed in 2022 and went into administration, leaving planholders uncertain about their funeral arrangements.

The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) then began an investigation into Safe Hands Plans Ltd and its parent company SHP Capital Holdings Limited, and Wells and Debenham were both charged earlier this year.

The hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Thursday was the first time the men had appeared in court charged with the offences.

Wells was the director of the parent company for Safe Hands, while Debenham has been described by the SFO as a "fellow senior executive".

The case was transferred to Southwark Crown Court, where a hearing has been scheduled for 5 March.

The court heard Wells, 39, is currently living in Marbella in Spain, while Debenham, 43, is living in Norwich.

Both were granted bail with the condition that they must notify the court and the SFO with any change of address, and they must do so within three days of moving.

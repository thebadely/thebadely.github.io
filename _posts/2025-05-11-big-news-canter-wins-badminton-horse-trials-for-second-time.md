It has been recently reported that Ros Canter won team eventing gold at Paris 2024

Olympic gold medallist Ros Canter won the Badminton Horse Trials for the second time in her career on Lordships Graffalo.

The pair, who claimed the title in 2023, regained it following a clear round in the showjumping.

Britain's Canter was second after the dressage and cross country elements behind compatriot Oliver Townend, who won the 2009 event.

But Townend, last out on board Cooley Rosalent, knocked down a rail in the showjumping finale to slip to second overall.

Canter, who was part of the British eventing team to win gold in the Paris Olympics last summer, dedicated her victory to her coach and mentor Caroline Moore, who died two months ago.

"This was for Caroline Moore, she was by my side my whole career," Canter told Horse and Hound.

"I'm so pleased I managed to make her proud. It's the first time I've done anything without her. Not only was she my trainer and mentor, but also the best friend."

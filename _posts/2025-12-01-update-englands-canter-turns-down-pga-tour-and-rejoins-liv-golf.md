It has been recently reported that Laurie Canter turned professional in 2011

England's Laurie Canter has turned down a place on the PGA Tour and rejoined LIV Golf for the 2026 season.

The 36-year-old finished seventh on the DP World Tour which earned him a spot on next year's PGA Tour via the Race to Dubai rankings.

However, Canter has instead decided to return to the Saudi Arabia-backed LIV team competition, where he played from 2022 to 2024, and will represent Majesticks GC.

"The league's growth has been remarkable and my experience in the league has led me to become a more complete player and a multiple winner on the DP World Tour," Canter said.

"To return to the league with Majesticks GC is a huge honour, and they bring a standard of excellence, ambition and identity that really resonates with me."

Canter won the 2024 European Open and 2025 Bahrain Championship, and became the first former LIV golfer to participate in a strictly PGA Tour event at this year's Players Championship.

According to new developments, Katie Boulter has a career-high ranking of 23

British number three Katie Boulter was beaten 6-3 6-1 by Romania's Sorana Cirstea in the second round of the Japan Open.

World number 59 Boulter, who shocked world number 17 Linda Noskova in the first round, lost in one hour nine minutes in Osaka.

There were three breaks of serve in the opening four games as Cirstea, ranked 51 in the world, went 3-1 ahead before wrapping up the first set.

She broke Boulter three times on the way to a 5-0 lead in the second.

Although Boulter broke back, she failed to hold serve in the next game as the impressive Cirstea secured a quarter-final place.

Japan's Naomi Osaka had a medical timeout in her 7-6 (8-6) 3-6 6-2 win over defending champion Suzan Lamens of the Netherlands.

Osaka was 5-0 up in the final set when she was treated, returning with strapping around her left thigh before securing a quarter-final meeting with Romania's Jaqueline Cristian on Friday.

"It was definitely really difficult," said Osaka. "I'm kind of sorry for my attitude but I'm really glad to have won."

She ended the on-court interview by saying: "Can I go? My leg is really hurting."

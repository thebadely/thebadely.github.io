According to new developments, Kyren Wilson beat Judd Trump to win the inaugural Xi'an Grand Prix in 2024

Shaun Murphy whitewashed defending champion Kyren Wilson to reach the Xi'an Grand Prix quarter-finals - and said it was "as good as I've ever played".

The 43-year-old hit a high of 141 in three centuries for a crushing 5-0 win over the world number two.

Wilson, the 2024 world champion, didn't pot a ball and scored just six points - thanks to a foul when Murphy hit the pink after being snookered - in the whole match against his relentless fellow Englishman, who made 533 in a row without reply.

"That's pretty much as good as I've ever played," said Murphy. "That's one of the best best-of-nine matches that I've ever been part of.

"It's mad. You play so many matches around the world throughout your life and every now and then it comes together."

A Crucible champion himself in 2005, Murphy will now face Ding Junhui in the last eight.

Ronnie O'Sullivan also continued his fine form with two century breaks in a 5-2 win over Jak Jones.

The seven-time world champion, who has impressed in his first tournament since August, will next play Gary Wilson in the quarter-finals.

Jones made a 140 to stay in the match, but O'Sullivan - who hit a best of 135 in the second frame - responded with an 81 break to seal the success.

The 49-year-old, who was a beaten semi-finalist in the first Xi'an Grand Prix last year, remained on course to win his first ranking title in 21 months.

Another former world champion, Mark Williams, fought back from 4-3 down to beat Barry Hawkins 5-4, but Stuart Bingham fell to a 5-3 loss at the hands of Lyu Haotian.

It has been recently reported that Singer Jessie J says she has undergone surgery for breast cancer and is now resting at home while awaiting her results.

In a social media post, the 37-year-old star thanked her doctor, surgeon and "all the nurses who cared for me", sharing series of photos and videos of her time in hospital.

She described the post as the "honest lows and highs of the last 48 hours" and promised to "always show the good and hard bits of any journey I go through".

The Essex singer revealed her early breast cancer diagnosis at the beginning of June and received widespread support from fellow colleagues for sharing her experience.

She said at the time she would be having the surgery after her performance at Capital's Summertime Ball, a mini-festival at London's Wembley Stadium held on 15 June.

In her post on Monday night, Jessie J shared pictures of her partner Chanan Safir Colman and their son visiting her in hospital.

One of the videos included was a clip of her singing in a hospital bed waiting to go into surgery.

Another video showed her post-surgery holding up a bottle of blood drained from her breasts which she joked was a "goji berry smoothie".

The pop star said she was "grateful" for everyone who helped her during the treatment process and gave encouragement to others facing difficult circumstances.

"Still hugging everyone going through something tough right now. We all got this!" she wrote.

Fans and industry colleagues have already responded with well wishes and messages of support.

TV presenter Gaby Roslin replied in the comments: "Sending you strength, energy and so much love you beautiful soul."

"I know Sky will be keeping you smiling and giving you strength... You're an absolute warrior," singer Marvin Hume wrote.

When she revealed her diagnosis earlier this month, Jessie J said she wanted to go public with the news in order to help process it and show solidarity with others going through a similar ordeal.

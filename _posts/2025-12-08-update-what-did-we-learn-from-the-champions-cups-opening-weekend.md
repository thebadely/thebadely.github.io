Let's dive into the details: Finn Russell's Bath provided an impressive all-round performance in their win over Munster

With the first round of matches in the 2025-26 Champions Cup all done and dusted, we take a look at what was learned from the opening weekend's fixtures.

French domination has been the theme of recent years, with the past five winners of the competition all from the Top 14, but round one included plenty of statement wins from some new challengers...

Defending champions Bordeaux came from behind to beat the Bulls 46-33 in Pretoria

Defending champions Bordeaux Begles were imperious in this competition last season, dominating their semi-final against Toulouse and then the final against Northampton.

Sixth in the Top 14, some suggest they cannot repeat the feat this year, but in round one Bordeaux served notice that they are more than capable of winning back-to-back titles with a high-scoring away win in South Africa.

Handed a difficult tie at Loftus Versfeld Stadium against a strong Bulls side boasting the likes of Willie le Roux, Handre Pollard and Canan Moodie, they trailed 33-22 at half-time.

But, as champions do, they showed their quality in the second half as they roared back to claim a 46-33 win - keeping the Bulls scoreless in the second 40 minutes. 

France international try-scoring machines Damian Penaud and World Player of the Year nominee Louis Bielle-Biarrey both got on the scoresheet and any side with those two on the wings has a chance of beating whoever is put in front of them.

Bath's sole success in this competition came almost 30 years ago but throughout the ensuing period they have probably never been better equipped to add a second star to the jersey.

The defending English Prem champions are top of the pile domestically after six games and will be aiming to translate that form into Europe - especially after suffering a surprise group-stage exit last year.

Johann van Graan's men looked a very complete and composed outfit in the 40-14 win over Munster, who are third in the United Rugby Championship, on Saturday night.

They combine attacking verve - sealing the bonus point inside 20 minutes at the Rec - with defensive steel, holding their visitors at arm's length when they threatened a dramatic comeback.

With Finn Russell and Ben Spencer in the half-backs and strength in depth across the squad they have to be considered serious contenders for a first European trophy since 1998.

Bath's key result in the pools last season came in the second round, an agonising 22-21 loss at Benetton with a rotated team.

Now with a Prem title under their belt and leading domestically again, Van Graan may feel able to put a heightened focus on the Champions Cup this year.

Did the Champions Cup opening weekend deliver?

Stafford McDowall scored a try on his 100th appearance for Glasgow

There are strong teams everywhere you look in the Champions Cup but Pool One looks set to be one of the most fiercely contested.

In the tournament's current format a lot is made about winning your home games, which is why Glasgow's away victory at Sale on Friday evening might just prove crucial.

The Scottish side were 14-0 down after 20 minutes but came back strongly and two tries early in the second half gave them a precious five points.

In doing so, they gave their chances of progressing a significant early boost and conversely dealt a hefty blow to Sale.

With Toulouse - imperious 56-19 winners against the Sharks - and Saracens, who brushed aside Clermont, also in the pool, we should be in for plenty of fireworks.

And what of Glasgow's old rivals Edinburgh? They produced one of their best European performances in years to stun three-time winners Toulon 33-20, on a fine weekend for Scottish rugby.

All Black Rieko Ioane made his Leinster debut against Harlequins 

If there's one team you would predict to be there or thereabouts at the business end of the season in Europe it would be four-time winners Leinster.

But in recent seasons it hasn't gone to plan as they have promised much but delivered little. Runners-up three years in a row between 2022-24 they looked heavy favourites last season after following up a 62-0 mauling of Harlequins in the last 16 with a 52-0 demolition of Glasgow in the quarter-final.

It was hoped that New Zealand full-back Jordie Barrett would be the missing ingredient to take them over the line, but they were ambushed and suffered a shock loss to Northampton Saints in the semi. 

This year they are trying the All Black experiment again, this time with Rieko Ioane,  who claimed a try assist on his debut in Saturday's 45-28 win over Harlequins.

Is Ioane the man to bring the trophy back to Ireland for the first time since 2018?

Leinster finish strongly to hold off Harlequins

Since the South African sides joined the Champions Cup in 2022-23 the furthest any of their teams have got is the quarter-finals and last year none of them managed to make it out of the group stage, with plenty of weakened teams fielded.

Is this the year that changes? The Stormers are top of the URC and started their European campaign off with a 26-17 away win at Bayonne on Friday.

The post-match comments were encouraging too, with players and coaches speaking of their ambition, and the likes of Springboks Cobus Reinach, Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu and Damian Willemse not involved in the round-one win.

The Stormers look the best bet for a South African side to go deep into the tournament, although don't count out the Sharks and Bulls, who both lost this weekend but did play Toulouse and Bordeaux respectively.

Northampton Saints against Pau was one of the most entertaining matches of the opening round

There were a few contenders for game of the weekend and this one was right up there.

Pau have been enjoying a brilliant season, led by Pumas Julian Montoya and Facundo Isa and former Wasps scrum-half Dan Robson. 

They are currently second in the Top 14 and the atmosphere was electric at the Stade du Hameau for their first Champions Cup game in 25 years.

Both sides played some superb rugby to make for an absorbing contest which remained level until the closing stages, when George Hendy scored the winning try to give last year's finalists a five-point victory.

But as a relative unknown to many fans watching at home, Pau certainly announced themselves on the big stage and no-one will fancy facing them at home, where they hadn't lost this season before this weekend.

As Saints and England scrum-half Alex Mitchell said after the game: "Pau are one hell of an outfit."

Northampton are unfancied by many but after this impressive win on the road, in which they fought back after a 20-minute card, the Saints have made a statement.

Hendy settles absorbing contest as Saints beat Pau

There was no Welsh representation at all in last year's Champions Cup so the return of Scarlets to the competition is one to be welcomed by rugby fans.

With Wales' struggles internationally and uncertainty over the future of the domestic scene the Scarlets almost pulled off a confidence-boosting win against Bristol Bears.

As it was they were edged out by one point with Wales international Louis Rees-Zammit's try proving the difference.

Building on a promising performance will be the next task but it doesn't get any easier - with defending champions Bordeaux next up.

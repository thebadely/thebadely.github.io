Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Katie Ledecky is the most decorated female Olympic swimmer but had not broken a world record for seven years

American swimming great Katie Ledecky has set her first world record in seven years.

The 28-year-old won the 800m freestyle at the Tyr Pro Series meet in Florida in eight minutes and 4.12 seconds, beating a record she posted nine years ago.

The time bettered the previous mark of 8:04.79, which the nine-time Olympic champion set while winning gold at the Rio 2016 Games.

It is the sixth time that Ledecky has set a new mark in the event since taking the record from Great Britain's two-time Olympic champion Rebecca Adlington in 2013.

Before her latest feat, Ledecky's most recent world record had come in the 1500m freestyle in May 2018 and she holds four in total - for long and short course in both the 800m and 1500m freestyle.

Ledecky, who swept both titles at both the Paris 2024 and Tokyo 2020 Games, has hit some fine form over the past week.

She posted her second-fastest 400m freestyle time on Thursday - her best in nine years - and the second-fastest 1500m freestyle time in history on Wednesday.

Earlier on Saturday, compatriot Gretchen Walsh beat her own 100m butterfly world record, clocking 55.09 seconds.

The 22-year-old holds the most current world records with nine - five individual and four relays.

Both Walsh and Ledecky be looking to add to their tallies of World Championship medals at the 2025 edition in Singapore from 11 July-3 August.

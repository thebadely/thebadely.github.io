Let's dive into the details: Arsenal's tifo left some supporters disappointed on Tuesday evening

The Emirates' atmosphere was hailed as among the best in the stadium's history for Arsenal's Champions League quarter-final at home to Real Madrid, so there were high expectations for Tuesday's semi-final against Paris St-Germain.

A fourth-minute goal for the away side punctured that, but Arsenal's tifo display also fell flat.

On social media, rival fans mocked the giant red flag with a white cannon, while some Gunners supporters also expressed their disappointment at what was unveiled.

It was the club's first Champions League semi-final appearance since 2009, so fans wanted something befitting the occasion.

Manager Mikel Arteta described the game as "one of the biggest in 19 years" in his pre-match news conference.

However, what was delivered did not quite fit the bill.

BBC Sport has been told that Arsenal were unable to accept the proposal of the fan tifo because of the short timeframe between games.

Arsenal fan group Ashburton Army raised more than Â£12,000 and offered to pay for their own personalised tifo with many different designs suggested to the club.

On 24 April, they posted an update saying: "As the tifo has been rejected by the club, we will refund people for it."

BBC Sport has been told that Arsenal were unable to accept the proposal because of the short timeframe between games.

What they used was a simple large red flag featuring the club's cannon emblem in white as the centrepiece. 

This hung from the roof of the North Bank Stand, while another smaller banner was held by fans in the East Stand with the words "make it happen" printed across it - a  pre-match message that Arteta had given to his players.

Those two displays were added to by fireworks and pyrotechnics, but they were far from anything out of the ordinary.

One fan posted on X: "I expected a very beautiful tifo from Arsenal only to discover this? It looks like Fifa career mode."

Another claimed: "I think this may be the most commonly agreed worst tifo of all time given the circumstances."

While a third said: "Arsenal turned down the fans' tifo design request to produce this monstrosity. Champions League semi-final and this was the best they could come up with? So disappointed."

According to former England striker Wayne Rooney, working as a TV pundit, the atmosphere at the Emirates on Tuesday was in contrast to the Real Madrid game.

Before that match, supporters in each block of the stadium held up red and white cards above their heads.

"For Arsenal, I was a bit disappointed with how they played, disappointed with the fans as well," Rooney told Amazon Prime.

"I thought tonight they were a bit subdued, almost like an anti-climax that they beat Real Madrid and were going to walk into the final and win the competition."

Why Arsenal can still reach Champions League final

Arsenal fan writer Laura Kirk: "One of the fan groups Ashburton Army had raised some money for a tifo which was ultimately rejected by the club, I imagine because the designs were not in keeping with the club's brand but the club haven't actually said anything. 

"In comparison with what we see elsewhere in Europe, like the one Real Madrid had against us last week, it just felt like a massively missed opportunity to do something amazing."

Oli Price-Bates from The Fresh Arsenal Podcast: "The tifo from the club was certainly a bit underwhelming. The occasion deserved more from the club to help with the atmosphere and fan engagement. 

"Certainly if Arsenal get to this stage again, they need to be better prepared and involve the fans in the process, not just in tifos but the wider experience and build-up for the match. 

"Hopefully we won't wait so long for another semi-final and the club will be better prepared to make more impact."

Broadcaster and Arsenal fan Harry Symeou: "I think the fans were hoping to see something with a bit more of a wow factor. Given there was lots of talk online with regards to some more elaborate, striking designs - you can understand why some felt underwhelmed.

"Tifos on the continent tend to be more creative and really can set the scene ahead of a huge occasion. Fan groups, in particular those known as 'ultras' normally have a big input - leading to a higher rate of fan satisfaction. But this is something we don't do well enough in English football generally. If as a club, you're going to take it upon yourselves to both plan and execute such displays, you've got to deliver something with far more imagination than that."

On the whole? Probably.

And it's certainly not just Arsenal who have fallen short in the department.

West Ham United tried their hand at one against the Gunners during this season's Premier League fixture at the London Stadium. It was a simple display of their logo in the middle of the date they were founded - unfortunately for them though, the date looked like it read 1695 rather than 1895.

Away from the gaffes though, English clubs have shown in recent times that it can be done when executed correctly. 

Aston Villa had impressive displays at Villa Park during their Champions League campaign, while Crystal Palace are certainly on the path of a team that get it "right" when it comes to tifos.

The two even had their own battle pre-match in the stands before their FA Cup semi-final at Wembley.

Villa unveiled three lions at their end before Palace displayed an impressive red and blue wall with an image of a child in front of an FA Cup lofted above the words "take my hand, take my whole life too."

Manchester United have also had some creative designs before their Europa League fixtures, while Newcastle United have been impressive throughout the season with their unique displays.

Do below par tifos have anything to do with the lack of 'ultra' culture in the Premier League?

Well, according to Jeffrey Kassing, Professor of the School of Social & Behavioural Sciences at Arizona State University and author of the book 'The Art of Tifo,' the emphatic answer to that is 'yes'.

"The tifo tradition is closely linked to the ultras form of fandom, as stadium performances are central to that identity," Kassing told BBC Sport.

"Geographically speaking, the ultras form of fandom took root more actively in southern and eastern Europe, whereas the hooligan form of fandom dominated in northern Europe, England included. 

"In places where hooliganism prevailed violence and hyper-masculinity were the means for enacting or performing identity. 

"Contrastingly, for ultras, stadium performances comprised of tifos, chanting, singing, and musical accompaniment, where allowed, predominate how they present fandom. 

"English fans are certainly not known for their tifos, but they definitely are appreciated for their witty and clever chants."

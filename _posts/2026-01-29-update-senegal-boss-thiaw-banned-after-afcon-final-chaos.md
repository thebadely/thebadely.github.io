Experts revealed that Pape Thiaw (centre) will miss five of Senegal's six 2027 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers

Senegal manager Pape Thiaw has been banned for five games after the chaotic scenes during the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations final against Morocco this month.

The Confederation of African Football (Caf) issued Thiaw with a $100,000 (Â£72,000) fine, saying he was guilty of "unsporting conduct" and "bringing the game into disrepute".

It was one of a number of fines handed out, totalling almost Â£1m, following the game.

The final on 18 January in Rabat, which Senegal went on to win 1-0, descended into disarray when Senegal's players left the field after Morocco were awarded a stoppage-time penalty.

Thiaw, still incensed by the referee's decision moments before to blow for a foul on Morocco captain Achraf Hakimi before Ismaila Sarr headed in, instructed his players to leave the field.

The match was delayed by about 17 minutes before Senegal forward Sadio Mane convinced his team-mates to return to the pitch.

In an Instagram post, external, Thiaw "humbly" asked fans not to organise fundraisers in his name to help pay the fine. 

After thanking supporters for "the love you show me every day", he said: "While I understand and appreciate this gesture of generosity, I invite you to redirect these funds to more urgent causes, for the benefit of those who truly need them."

Brahim Diaz's Panenka penalty was saved by Senegal goalkeeper Edouard Mendy, and referee Jean-Jacques Ndala then immediately blew the whistle for full-time.

Pape Gueye scored the winning goal in the fourth minute of extra time to seal a second Afcon triumph in five years for Senegal.

Senegal forwards Iliman Ndiaye and Sarr received two-match bans for "unsporting behaviour towards the referee", while the Senegal Football Federation (FSF) was fined a total of $615,000 (Â£444,000).

Morocco forward Ismael Saibari was given a three-match ban and fined $100,000 (Â£72,000), while defender Hakimi was handed a two-match ban, with one game suspended for 12 months.

A bid by Morocco's football federation (FRMF) to have the result of the match overturned after Senegal players left the pitch was dismissed by Caf's disciplinary committee.

The bans for Thiaw and the four players relate to Caf matches only and will not impact preparation for the World Cup in the US, Canada and Mexico.

'Shameful' and 'terrible look' - the chaos that marred Senegal's triumph 

What we learned from Afcon 2025

The FSF was fined $600,000 (Â£434,000) for breaches of Caf's disciplinary code, with half of that sum relating to the unsporting conduct of Senegal players and technical staff, while the other $300,000 was for the improper conduct of its supporters.

Several Teranga Lions fans were involved in angry confrontations with security staff after the penalty award, with some trying to enter the pitch. 

A further $15,000 ($11,000) fine was imposed after Thiaw's side received five bookings during the final.

Meanwhile, the FRMF has been fined $200,000 (Â£144,000) for the "inappropriate behaviour" of ball boys at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium, after repeated attempts to steal the towel of Senegal keeper Mendy from behind his goal.

A sum of $100,000 must be paid after Atlas Lions players and staff invaded the video assistant referee review area and obstructed referee Ndala's work, and the FRMF has also been fined $15,000 for use of lasers by its supporters.

The sanctions from the final follow on from Algeria's football federation (Faf) being fined a total of $100,000 last week for six breaches of Caf regulations during the side's Afcon quarter-final exit at the hands of Nigeria.

Half of that sum was for "offensive and abusive gestures committed by its supporters" towards the match officials, including displaying banknotes.

Faf was also fined $25,000 for the "inappropriate behaviour" of its players and officials at the end of the match, which the Fennecs lost 2-0.

Algeria goalkeeper Luca Zidane has been banned for two games for misconduct, while right-back Rafik Belghali has received a four-game ban - with two games suspended for 12 months - for "aggressive and intimidating behaviour towards the match referee" after the full-time whistle.

The further Faf fines are $10,000 for failing to comply with security measures and three separate fines of $5,000 for throwing of objects by supporters, the use of smoke devices by fans and for receiving five yellow cards during the game in Marrakech.

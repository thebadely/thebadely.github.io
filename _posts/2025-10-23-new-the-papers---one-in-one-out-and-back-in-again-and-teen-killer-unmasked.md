Let's dive into the details: The return of a migrant to the UK on a small boat, who'd already been sent back to France under the government's "one in, one out" scheme, is the lead for many. "Le Farce", declares The Daily Mail. The Daily Express and The Daily Telegraph's headlines both say: "One in, one out...and back in again!". The Telegraph carries reaction from Reform UK's leader, Nigel Farage; it quotes him as saying that the policy is "an abject failure". The paper also carries comment from the Conservative Party leader, Kemi Badenoch. She says that the government is "too weak to take the tough decisions to secure our borders". Writing in The Sun, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood pledges to "act quicker" to deport illegal migrants.

The Guardian reports on research which suggests that one in 12 secondary school pupils is put into an isolation room at least once a week. The paper says the study from the University of Manchester showed that children with special educational needs were more than twice as likely to be put in isolation, as were pupils who identified as LGBTQ+. It reports researchers as saying that their work showed the practice was "more widespread and harmful than parents or school leaders realise".

Women over 40 will be asked questions about the menopause during routine NHS check-ups for the first time, The Daily Mail reports. The paper says it's hoped the move will raise awareness of the symptoms so more women recognise the signs. The paper quotes Health Secretary Wes Streeting as saying that many women have been left to "navigate" menopause alone, because of an "outdated health system that fails to acknowledge how serious it can be".

The Independent reports on a collaboration between Agatha Christie's detectives Miss Marple, and Hercule Poirot and the Mr Men and Little Miss books. "Little Miss Marple, Muddle at the Vicarage" and "Mr Poirot, Mischief on the Nile" are published today. They were commissioned by Adam Hargreaves, whose father Roger, was behind the original Mr Men series.

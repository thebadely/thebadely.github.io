Here’s what you need to know: Paddy Pimblett fell to his fourth defeat in MMA and his first in the UFC

Paddy Pimblett suffered the first defeat of his UFC career against Justin Gaethje at UFC 324 in Las Vegas.

The lightweight interim title fight was a war that went against Pimblett in the end and the Liverpudlian now faces a spell on the sidelines recovering.

Pimblett, 31, was taken to hospital directly after the loss, missing the post-fight news conference, but was praised by Dana White as one of the division's elite fighters.

What happens next for Pimblett? And who could he fight on his return to action?

Pimblett title shot 'completely undeserved' - Tsarukyan

Arman Tsarukyan was one of the first to take aim at Pimblett after the fight, suggesting he was "gifted" his opportunities in the UFC.

The lightweights have been sparring from a distance since Tsarukyan was overlooked for the interim title shot, despite being ranked number one in the division.

Tsarukyan is in truth a very tricky return. He is a solid all-round competitor and is on a five-fight unbeaten streak with just one loss in his past 11 contests.

The fight would generate a lot of interest and be another chance for Pimblett to show he belongs among the elite lightweights.

And a win over Tsarukyan would fire Pimblett right back into the title picture.

Pimblett and Dan Hooker feuding wouldn't have been on many people's bingo cards this year.

Hooker and Pimblett have both said some cruel things about each other in recent weeks. 

Pimblett questioned Hooker's grappling ability with a reference to his mother, while Hooker referenced the death of Pimblett's close friend to hit back at a comment.

It means a proper grudge match is in the works and Hooker would be a favourable return for Pimblett considering the seasoned contenders currently sitting in the top five of the lightweight rankings.

New Zealander Hooker is sixth in the rankings, one place below Pimblett.

Dana White hails Pimblett's toughness in loss to Justin Gaethje

UFC London takes place on 21 March. Usually the UFC host one UK event per year, but Pimblett's stardom may convince the MMA promotion to sign off a homecoming.

Pimblett last fought in Liverpool in 2018, the same year UFC last held a fight night in the city.

He would be a natural headliner and an instant sell-out.

Max Holloway and Charles Oliveira fight in March in a rematch of their 2015 encounter

Before Ilia Topuria decided to take a hiatus, Pimblett was pencilled in to fight Charles Oliveira next.

The Brazilian is now booked to take on Max Holloway for the BMF title on 7 March in Las Vegas.

The BMF may be a symbolic title but it has turned into a status symbol for the UFC's most exciting fighters.

Holloway currently holds the title. The fight would also serve as a potential rankings boost with Holloway at number three and Oliveira at number two.

Pimblett will need time to recover and fighting the winner of a contest between two legends could be the perfect return.

Pundits' verdict on Jackson dismissal

Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca went through his full range of brave faces, but he will know just how expensive the damaging defeat at Newcastle United could prove to be.

Maresca has been keen to emphasise what he regards as Chelsea's progress since he succeeded Mauricio Pochettino in the summer.

The reality, especially what passes for reality at Stamford Bridge, means the final judgement will only come once the Premier League season concludes.

The Italian regards Chelsea's advance to an upcoming Europa Conference League final meeting with Real Betis as the clearest signal of an upward trend under his guidance.

The brutal truth is that this is a competition Chelsea have been expected to win. There will be no flowers handed out at Stamford Bridge for winning Europe's third-tier tournament.

For a club of Chelsea's ambition, not to mention vast financial outlay, the Champions League is what matters. That is where the club believes it should be.

The Blues are still clinging on to the final Champions League spot with two matches remaining but, with just a point separating them and seventh, it is far too close for comfort.

And the 2-0 loss on Tyneside places a heavy load on their final two games at home to Manchester United, then, with great significance as they are chasing the same lucrative prize, away to seventh-placed Nottingham Forest on the last day.

If Chelsea win the Conference League but do not qualify for the Champions League,  Maresca must expect this season to be judged as failure, however harsh that judgement may seem.

The stakes could not be higher, not least for Maresca, who has had a somewhat loveless relationship with Chelsea fans never fully convinced by the studied passing style which is his trademark.

This defeat means Chelsea have lost six of their last nine away games in the Premier League, winning one and drawing two. Since Christmas Day, only Leicester City and Southampton (both four) have picked up fewer away points in the competition than Chelsea's five.

It is a flaw that has brought Chelsea to the point where the success of their season hangs in a delicate balance.

And all this makes the act of wild indiscipline from striker Nicolas Jackson after 35 minutes at St. James' Park, with Chelsea already trailing to Sandro Tonali's early goal, not only reckless but potentially very expensive.

Only Jackson can explain what possessed him to launch himself forearm first into the face of Newcastle defender Sven Botman, a red card the inevitable outcome once referee John Brooks was directed towards the screen by the Video Assistant Referee.

Jackson not only left Chelsea short-handed at Newcastle, he will now miss those pivotal final games that could shape so many futures at Stamford Bridge. This may yet be one very pricey swing of a forearm.

Chelsea's owners may reflect more favourably on Maresca's first campaign in charge should they make the top five and the Champions League, while key player Cole Palmer will feel more comfortable in Europe's elite competition.

Maresca was aiming in the wrong direction when he suggested the noise inside the Tyneside cauldron made the officials' decision to send Jackson off. 

This was on the striker â no-one else.

His words made a somewhat hollow sound when he said: "If the referee decides it's red, it's because they decide and they are convinced. It can be easy to make some decisions like this in this stadium with its noise.

"Sometimes you get the feeling that some decisions are from the noise. It's not only for this game, it is for the next two games, for him the season is finished."

Ironically, Maresca's shrewd tactical tweaks for the second half improved Chelsea. He replaced Noni Madueke with Reece James and moved Palmer into a false nine role against Newcastle's three centre-backs until counterpart Eddie Howe countered with changes of his own.

Maresca's argument did carry weight when he said: "To come here and for one hour to play with 10 players is not easy. In the second half the team showed effort, spirit [and] energy. We must keep this spirit and energy."

It was all for nothing, however, as Bruno Guimaraes' stoppage-time effort took a deflection off Malo Gusto to loop agonisingly over Chelsea keeper Robert Sanchez.

Chelsea showed enough in the second half to demonstrate that all is not lost. The Champions League remains a realistic destination, but that final-day visit to The City Ground is assuming heavier significance.

The Champions League is the bottom line for Chelsea and Maresca and much rests on it for so many at Stamford Bridge. One inexplicable act from  Jackson may just make it more difficult to achieve.

BBC Sport speaks to Aryna Sabalenka and Nick Kyrgios about their controversial 'Battle of the Sexes' match set to take place in Dubai in December.

Women's world number one Sabalenka insists the exhibition match is "not a risk" to her and to women's sport.

Kyrgios, the men's 2022 Wimbledon runner-up, responds to criticism of him taking part, given he admitted assaulting an ex-girlfriend in 2021 and has made a series of comments which have been considered misogynistic.

Let's dive into the details: Aryna Sabalenka is the top seed at Wimbledon

World number one Aryna Sabalenka overcame a battling Elise Mertens to reach the quarter-finals and stay on course for a first Wimbledon title.

The 27-year-old, who reached the semi-finals in 2021 and 2023, won 6-4 7-6 (7-4) and will next face world number 104 Laura Siegemund for a place in the last four.

This has been a tournament in which many seeds have tumbled and Sabalenka was the only top six seed remaining in the women's draw.

It hasn't been plain sailing for Sabalenka as she came through a tough match against British number one Emma Raducanu to set up her meeting with Mertens.

This again was perhaps tougher than expected, particularly as Sabalenka had beaten 24th seed Mertens nine times in a row prior to meeting at Wimbledon.

"I am super happy with the performance. It was a battle. I was happy to get this win," said Sabalenka.

"She is a great player and great person. I know how smart she is and I knew she would fight until the very end. She really challenged me today."

It did initially look like being a comfortable win for Sabalenka as she got an early break on her way to racing into a 4-1 lead, but Mertens got a break back as she started to move her opponent around the court more.

Sabalenka broke Mertens again to take the opening set - but the Belgian continued to cause problems with her aggressive tennis.

She was rewarded for her brave play when she got her first break of the match early in the second set, taking advantage as Sabalenka struggled to get her first serve working before thumping down a backhand winner, and then holding to lead 3-1.

Sabalenka broke back two games later but Mertens was undeterred, the two going toe-to-toe all the way to a tie-break.

But there Sabalenka showed her quality, fighting back from 2-0 down to win and progress.

"Everything is possible," Sabalenka said of winning Wimbledon.

"I am just trying to give my best and really hope for the best."

At 37, Siegemund - Sabalenka's next opponent - is the oldest woman left in the Wimbledon singles draw.

The veteran German ended lucky loser Solana Sierra's hugely impressive run at the tournament.

Sierra had lost in qualifying but was invited into the main draw after a withdrawal, only finding out 15 minutes before her first-round match.

The 21-year-old from Argentina was looking to become the first lucky loser to make the quarter-finals of a Grand Slam but her journey was ended in round four as Siegemund won 6-3 6-2.

Finally, 13th seed Amanda Anisimova continued her fine form on grass this year as she beat 30th seed Linda Noskova 6-2 5-7 6-4.

This was her 10th win in 12 outings on this surface in 2025, underlining her credentials as a contender for the title.

Anisimova will next face world number 50 Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, who knocked out British number three Sonay Kartal earlier on Sunday.

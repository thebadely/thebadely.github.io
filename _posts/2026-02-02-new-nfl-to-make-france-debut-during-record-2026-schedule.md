It has been recently reported that The New Orleans Saints are the only NFL team with marketing rights in France

The NFL will make its France debut as part of a record nine international games in 2026.

On the opening day of Super Bowl week, the NFL also announced multi-year partnerships to return to Mexico and Spain.

But there will be no immediate return to Ireland after Dublin staged its first game in September.

Paris' Stade de France will welcome the NFL next season, with the New Orleans Saints confirmed as one of the participating teams for that game. The date has yet to be confirmed.

Mexico has not staged an NFL game since 2022 because the Estadio Azteca was being renovated for this summer's World Cup, but the league has agreed to play there in each of the next three seasons.

Spain's first game was played at Bernabeu Stadium in November and the NFL has now made a "multi-year commitment" to play in Madrid.

France will become the fifth European nation to stage regular-season games, after the UK, Germany, Ireland and Spain.

"Bringing a regular-season game to Paris in 2026 marks an exciting next step in the continued expansion of the league's global footprint," said NFL commissioner Roger Goodell.

The Saints are the only team to have marketing rights in France as part of the NFL's global markets programme.

"This moment is special not only because of the strong cultural connection between Louisiana and France, but also because we will compete before a growing Saints fan base in Paris," said Saints owner Gayle Benson.

International games will also be held in Brazil and Germany during the 2026 season, while London will host three and Australia will stage its first.

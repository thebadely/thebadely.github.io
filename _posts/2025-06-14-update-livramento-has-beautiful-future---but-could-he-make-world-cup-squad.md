It has been recently reported that Tino Livramento won player of the match in England's opening win against the Czech Republic at the Under 21 European Championship

Former England left-back Ashley Cole believes Newcastle full-back Tino Livramento has "a beautiful and bright future" and that the defender can get to "whatever level he wants".

Cole, who won 107 caps for England, is assistant coach for the England Under-21s and was speaking after Livramento won player of the match for an impressive display at left-back in England's 3-1 win over the Czech Republic.

England U21s are attempting to defend their European Championship title and Livramento's performance played a big part in getting them off to the perfect start.

Cole is familiar with the 22-year-old, having worked with him when he was at Stamford Bridge as a first-team coach.

"He was in the under-21s, in the reserve group at Chelsea," said Cole in Slovakia. "You always see the passion and level he could get to.

"I think him getting the opportunity at Newcastle and continuing to play first-team football gave him the belief, the confidence in his own ability.

"And of course, a manager that's trusted him to play at such a young age. I think he had quite a big challenge going to Newcastle, but he's developing into a top player." 

Head coach Lee Carsley is without a natural left-back in his squad, a position that has also been an issue in the senior team in recent years.

At last year's European Championship in Germany, Gareth Southgate took an unfit Luke Shaw as the only natural left-back - and nine different players have featured in the position in the past year.

Arsenal's Myles Lewis-Skelly appears to be leading the chase for that slot currently but, with limited options, Livramento will see an opportunity.

Despite being a natural right-back, Livramento often played on the opposite side for Newcastle this season and left-back could be his clearest way into Thomas Tuchel's plans for the World Cup next summer.

Cole said: "As a coach, you stand on the sideline and see how much information he takes on board.

"And I keep saying it, but the willingness to want to learn and be the best, I think is always a great trait to have.

"Whatever level he wants to get to, he can get to because he's got that personality and desire.

"I think he's got a beautiful future, a bright future. Long may it continue that he keeps playing for Newcastle, keeps gaining experience and keeps his levels up."

Tino Livramento played at left-back for Newcastle on numerous occasions this season

Livramento does have one senior England appearance, being given his debut by Carsley in November during his spell as interim head coach - and he set up Anthony Gordon's second goal in a 5-0 Nations League win against the Republic of Ireland.

He was then selected in Tuchel's first senior squad in March but has dropped back down into the under-21s, with the German wanting him to take a leadership role during the tournament.

"I see it as a privilege. Thomas [Tuchel] obviously spoke to me about the senior squad and said that he wanted to speak to Lee as well about giving me that role,"  Livramento said.

"I've never played a tournament for England at any age group. I've always missed it through injuries.

"I think that's a big thing for me, coming here, getting this experience and playing with loads of boys that I've come through the age groups with."

Livramento is also an attacking outlet for his club, whichever side he plays on

Livramento left Chelsea for Southampton for Â£5m during Tuchel's Blues reign in pursuit of first-team football, despite the German since admitting the club wanted to keep him.

He excelled on the south coast and, despite an injury-hit second season, moved to Newcastle in August 2023 for an initial Â£32m.

Livramento is now experienced at the top level, playing 93 times in the Premier League - ending last season with a League Cup winners' medal and playing a key role in the Magpies' Champions League qualification.

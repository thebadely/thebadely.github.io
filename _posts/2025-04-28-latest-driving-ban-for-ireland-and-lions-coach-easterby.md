Here’s what you need to know: Ireland's interim head coach Simon Easterby has been disqualified from driving for six months after being caught speeding.

The former rugby player was caught exceeding the 70mph speed limit on a dual carriageway in Bodmin, Cornwall, last August.

On Monday, Cardiff Magistrates' Court considered Easterby's work and family commitments that require him to drive.

But the court did not not find exceptional hardship and the rugby coach was told he would be disqualified from driving for six months.

Former Scarlets player Easterby, who lives in Vale of Glamorgan, was also told to pay a fine as well as a surcharge.

The court heard the figure came to a total of £1,345 which has to be paid within the next week.

In February, Easterby was linked with the vacant Wales head coach job following Warren Gatland's dismissal.

He recently joined the British and Irish Lions coaching set-up as the team prepares to take on Australia this summer.

Experts revealed that A team from Brazil has won the Fifa Club World Cup on four occasions - but the last time was in 2012

"This Club World Cup is a dream come true for Brazil fans," says South American football expert Tim Vickery, speaking from Rio de Janeiro.

"Every bus stop, every water cooler... everyone is talking about it. It's full-on."

While Britain sleeps, with some games at the newly expanded tournament in the United States kicking-off at 02:00 BST, Brazil is going wild for it. 

And no wonder.

Millions of football fans have been glued to television sets following the fortunes of Rio-based teams Botafogo, Flamengo and Fluminense - as well as Palmeiras, who are based in Sao Paulo.

And it has been some tournament for them.

Fluminense beat Al-Hilal 2-1 in the quarter-finals on Friday to set up a last-four meeting with either Palmeiras or Chelsea, who meet at 02:00 BST on Saturday.

After all four Brazilian sides progressed from their groups to the last-16 stage with some eye-catching results, it has left fans asking if a team from the country can win the Club World Cup for the first time since 2012?

The United States is also hosting most of the games at the 2026 World Cup next summer. Canada and Mexico are co-hosts.

If a team from Brazil wins the Club World Cup, what will that say about the chances of the Brazil national team winning the World Cup for a sixth time?

Interestingly, this club-level success was not necessarily anticipated.

"I didn't expect that, most people in Brazil didn't expect that," said Brazilian sports journalist Renata Mendonca, speaking to BBC World Service Sport about all four Brazilian teams advancing.

"The way they want to show the world... the Brazilian teams are good enough and could be at the top of the world. This motivates them a lot."

Will a South American team win the Club World Cup?

PSG stunned by Brazilian champions Botafogo

Palmeiras finished second in Brazil's top flight in 2024 

Manchester City, Inter Milan, Atletico Madrid and Porto have already been sent packing, while both teams from Argentina - Boca Juniors and River Plate - have also been eliminated.

Brazil's Flamengo and Botafogo fell at the last-16 stage, but the country's remaining two sides hope to march on.

"This tournament is a priority in the way an Olympic athlete will do all of his training and programming to peak at a specific time," Vickery tells BBC Sport.

"Certainly for Palmeiras, who really want to win it. This is an absolute priority for them and they have programmed to be at their peak now."

Could the climate, which the Brazilian teams are used to, be helping give them an edge?

Both Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca and Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola have mentioned the extreme heat since the tournament started.

Chelsea trained in 37C before their 3-0 group win over ES Tunis in Philadelphia.

"It is almost impossible to train or to make a session because of the weather," said Maresca last week, while Guardiola said before last Thursday's match with Juventus that his players must be prepared to "suffer" in the challenging heat of Orlando.

The soaring temperatures across the United States have led to matches across the competition implementing water breaks during games.

But not all players have struggled in the heat.

"We're used to it," Botafogo right-back Vitinho, who spent two years at Burnley, said of the high temperatures.

Another factor to consider is that all four teams from Brazil had broken away from their domestic season, which runs from March until December, to take part.

While they appear fresh and sharp, teams from Europe went into the Club World Cup on the back of long seasons.

PSG's first game against Atletico Madrid in Pasadena on 15 June came 15 days after their 5-0 mauling of Inter Milan in the Champions League final in Munich.

Vickery adds: "A few weeks ago the Flamengo president was saying to a mate of mine 'we're flying in mid-season'.

"For the European clubs... is it the end of their season? Is it pre-season? The European clubs, their planning hasn't been to peak now."

Vickery believes there is something else to factor into the conversation about Brazilian clubs doing well.

"There is more money in Brazilian football [than before]" he says. "The standard has risen over the last few seasons. One reason is because of the influx of foreign coaches.

"Of the four Brazilian clubs here - two have Portuguese coaches [Abel Ferreira - Palmeiras and Renato Paiva - Botafogo].

"There's plenty of Portuguese and Argentine coaches in Brazilian football and it's brought more ideas. Even Filipe Luis, the Brazilian coaching Flamengo, his back-up staff are all Spanish.

"There's an openness to new ideas that there wasn't a few years ago."

Mendonca adds: "The timing of this competition is very good for South American teams. They are in the middle of their season, they are very well prepared physically. 

"They have better conditions now to keep their talented players and even bring back some players. Flamengo, for example, signed Jorginho after leaving Arsenal, while Danilo and Alex Sandro have come from Juventus.

"Also Botafogo, they have kept Igor Jesus for this competition. After this he will go to Nottingham Forest.

"These are aspects that explain why Brazilian teams are performing very well."

Flamengo, who beat Chelsea, are the current leaders in Brazil's top flight

Tens of thousands of fans have travelled from Brazil to cheer their respective clubs at the Club World Cup.

Their presence has proved one of the highlights of the tournament so far, with vibrant atmospheres at all of their games.

Brazil have already qualified for the 2026 World Cup, but Vickery does not believe the performance of the club teams will have any bearing on how Carlo Ancelotti's side perform next year.

"What the performances of the Brazilian clubs highlight is the strength of national teams like Colombia and Uruguay," he adds.

"Palmeiras, Botafogo, Flamengo and Fluminense... a lot of their best players are not Brazilians.

"The way that European football treats Brazil, Brazilian football now treats the rest of South America. You have got two of the midfielders for Colombia - Richard Rios of Palmeiras and Jhon Arias of Fluminense.

"Gustavo Gomez, a centre-back for Paraguay, plays for Palmeiras and Jefferson Savarino, who plays for Venezuela, made the goal for Botafogo against PSG.

"That's the model - Brazil sells its best players to Europe and one of the ways they replenish them is from neighbouring countries in South America."

Fluminense finished 13th in Brazil's top flight last season

Fluminense: It has been a rollercoaster few years for Fluminense, having won the Copa Libertadores in 2023 for the first time.

They followed that up by almost being relegated from Brazil's top flight last season - just avoiding the embarrassment of being in the Club World Cup and the country's second tier.

This season they are sixth after 11 games and are captained by former Chelsea defender Thiago Silva. They also have the oldest player in the tournament, 44-year-old goalkeeper Fabio.

Palmeiras: One of South America's most popular clubs, they are no stranger to success during their 111-year history.

They have won 57 trophies, including three Copa Libertadores - the South American equivalent of the Champions League. They were the champions of Brazil most recently in 2023.

Their star player is 18-year-old forward Estevao, who will be joining Chelsea after the tournament, with Palmeiras having previously sold Endrick to Real Madrid.

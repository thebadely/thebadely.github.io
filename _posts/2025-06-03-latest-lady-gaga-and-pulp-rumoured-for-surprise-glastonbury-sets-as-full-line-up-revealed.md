Hereâ€™s what you need to know: With just three weeks to go, Glastonbury Festival has unveiled its full line-up and stage times for 2025 - complete with gaps for secret sets.

The 1975, Neil Young and Olivia Rodrigo will headline the Pyramid Stage, with other highlights including Charli XCX, Doechii, Rod Stewart, Loyle Carner, The Prodigy and Wolf Alice.

Irish rap trio Kneecap remain on the line-up, after being removed from Glasgow's TRNSMT festival following a well-publicised row over their political statements.

And, as always, there are surprises in store. Several slots are marked "TBA", with rumoured guests including festival stalwarts like Haim and Pulp; alongside more far-fetched options such as Lady Gaga and Radiohead.

Lady Gaga last played Glastonbury at the start of her career in 2009. Asked what it would take for her to return to the festival earlier this year, she replied: "Not much".

Eagle-eyed fans will also spot that an unknown band called "Patchwork" are billed on the main stage on Saturday afternoon - calling to mind the 2023 festival, when the mysteriously named "ChurnUps" turned out to be the Foo Fighters.

The festival will kick off with two opening ceremonies on Wednesday 25 June, including a theatre and circus show - including high wire walkers and acrobats - in the Pyramid field, followed by a fireworks display at 22:45 BST.

At the same time, a 1,000-voice choir will unite in what organisers call "a powerful mantra for peace", around the Flame of Hope - which unites 15 sacred flames from around the world.

As ever, you'll be able to follow all the action on BBC television, radio, iPlayer and BBC Sounds, with more than 100 full sets being broadcast over the weekend.

Let's dive into the details: Xavi, Oliver Glasner and Darren Fletcher

The search for Manchester United's next manager is on.

After only 14 months in charge, Ruben Amorim was sacked on Monday following his latest criticism of the club's hierarchy.

United are sixth in the Premier League and in contention for Champions League football next season.

BBC Sport understands Darren Fletcher will take charge for the next few matches before United appoint a caretaker manager for the rest of the season.

But who could be handed the reins full-time this summer?

With Erik ten Hag, Ralf Rangnick and now Amorim ending in failure at United, should they go with a manager tried and tested in the Premier League?

Unai Emery has done a sterling job in leading Aston Villa from the edge of relegation back to Europe and into title contention this season.

Villa are third in the table - only six points adrift of leaders Arsenal.

Would Emery's mixed spell in charge of the Gunners work against him, though?

Andoni Iraola will also have suitors after leading unfancied Bournemouth to ninth last season.

The Cherries are on an 11-match winless streak, but it would be hard for Iraola to turn United down if the opportunity arose.

Oliver Glasner is out of contract at Crystal Palace in the summer and his side won the FA Cup last season, while Eddie Howe ended Newcastle's long wait for a major trophy by winning the Carabao Cup.

Both might be tempted by a new challenge.

How does Amorim's record compare to other Man Utd managers?

Could United's next permanent manager be an internal appointment?

Former midfielder and current Under-18s coach Fletcher, 41, spent 11 years playing for United under Sir Alex Ferguson,

Another obvious contender is former United midfielder Michael Carrick.

He is out of work after being sacked from his first managerial job at Middlesbrough in June.

The 44-year-old, who also played for West Ham and Tottenham, made 463 appearances for United in a 12-year spell, winning 17 trophies before retiring in 2018.

Whether he is still out of work by the summer remains to be seen.

Ipswich Town boss Kieran McKenna is another with United links who could be in the frame.

The 39-year-old former United assistant first-team coach has impressed in his first managerial role at Ipswich.

He guided them into the Premier League via back-to-back promotions and, after relegation last season, has got them to third in the Championship this season.

Another promotion this season would undoubtedly strengthen his case.

What about a return for former United striker and boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer?

It may be unlikely, but he is out of work and still a favourite with the fans.

His three-year stint between 2018 and 2021 ended in disappointment, but does he deserve more credit for the job he did?

A little more than four years ago United finished second in the Premier League under Solskjaer, scoring 73 goals - the most in a season since Ferguson's era ended in 2013.

There are plenty of big names in Europe whom United could target.

One name United have continuously been linked with is USA boss Mauricio Pochettino.

With the US co-hosting the World Cup this summer, United's preference to wait for a permanent appointment would appear to suit him well.

A name high on many people's list is ex-Barcelona boss Xavi.

He has been out of work since 2024 and the opportunity to manage in the Premier League would surely be a tempting prospect.

Former Barcelona manager Luis Enrique delivered the Champions League for Paris St-Germain as part of the Treble last season.

He is still in the PSG hotseat but has won it all with the French champions.

The great Zinedine Zidane is still out of work four years after leaving Real Madrid, but is he still holding out for the France job one day?

Roberto de Zerbi, who knows about working in England after his time at Brighton, is doing an impressive job at Marseille.

However, he is known for saying what he thinks. Could he be too volatile for the United hierarchy?

Gareth Southgate has been linked with the Man Utd job in the past

Gareth Southgate has long been linked with United, but ruled himself out of the running before Amorim's appointment when he said he will not return to coaching for at least a year after leaving England.

Having been out of management since July 2024, could he be ready for a return?

Southgate managed England for 102 games in eight years and guided them to two European Championship finals and a World Cup semi-final.

United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe is known to be a fan, but Southgate has not managed at club level since leaving Middlesbrough 16 years ago.

What about Enzo Maresca? Sacked by Chelsea last week, he is available and - like Southgate - could be an option for the short and longer term.

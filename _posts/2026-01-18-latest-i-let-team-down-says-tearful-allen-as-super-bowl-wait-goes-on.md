Experts revealed that Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen has never won in overtime in seven attempts

Buffalo quarterback Josh Allen was in tears as he addressed the media after the Denver Broncos beat the Bills to move within one win of the Super Bowl.

Allen had a chance to clinch victory in overtime but his fifth turnover of Saturday's Divisional Round game allowed the Broncos to kick a field goal and win 33-30.

That means that despite reaching the play-offs in seven straight seasons, the NFL's reigning Most Valuable Player is still to reach the sport's biggest game.

The 29-year-old also has the most play-off wins by a quarterback without playing in a Super Bowl (eight).

"It's extremely difficult," said an emotional Allen. "I feel like I let my team-mates down tonight.

"Missed opportunities throughout the game. It's been a long season, I hate how it ended and it's going to stick with me for a long time."

In Saturday's other match-up, the Seattle Seahawks romped to a 41-6 win over the San Francisco 49ers.

Broncos quarterback Nix breaks ankle in play-off win

Having secured the AFC's top seed, Denver had home advantage against the Bills and led 23-10 during the third quarter, before the Bills twice came from behind to make it 30-30.

However, the Broncos prevailed in overtime to claim their first play-off success since winning the Super Bowl for the third time in February 2016.

That game took place at the 49ers' Levi's Stadium, which will also stage this year's edition, Super Bowl 60, on Sunday, 8 February.

Denver and Seattle will host next weekend's Conference Championship games, but the Broncos will have to manage without quarterback Bo Nix. 

Shortly after Saturday's game, head coach Sean Payton confirmed the 25-year-old, who threw three touchdown passes, suffered a broken ankle on the game's final drive so will miss the rest of the Broncos' play-off run.

Denver have had one of the NFL's best defences and forced more sacks than any other team in the regular season

The Kansas City Chiefs knocked the Bills out of the play-offs in four of the past five years, but with the four-time winners missing the post-season, along with AFC rivals Baltimore and Cincinnati, this was meant to be Buffalo's year.

Despite being the AFC's sixth seed, Buffalo were still narrow favourites against a team that had won 13 of their previous 14 games and a defence that led the league for sacks - yet it was turnovers that hurt the Bills.

Allen had not turned the ball over in any of his six previous play-off games but had two fumbles in three plays either side of half-time, both resulting in Denver field goals.

That added to the Broncos' lead after touchdowns by Frank Crum and Lil'Jordan Humphrey had cancelled out Mecole Hardman's opener for Buffalo.

Allen had also thrown 200 passes without an interception before being picked off in the third quarter here. Yet the 29-year-old regrouped to help Buffalo put up 17 unanswered points thanks to Keon Coleman and Dalton Kincaid touchdowns in the fourth quarter.

After a Marvin Mims score put Denver back in front with 55 seconds left, Allen led the Bills into position for 41-year-old Matt Prater to level matters with a last-gasp field goal 

However, even though the Buffalo defence got a stop on the first possession of overtime, Allen gave up his fifth turnover of the day as Denver cornerback Ja'Quan McMillian claimed an interception in a contested catch with Brandin Cooks.

Wil Lutz's fourth field goal ensured Allen has lost his three overtime games in the post-season, and all seven overall in his career.

Buffalo's Sean McDermott also has the most play-off wins by a head coach without reaching a Super Bowl (eight).

Last week's victory at Jacksonville ensured the Bills became just the fourth team to claim a play-off win in six straight seasons. The other three each won three Super Bowls - but the wait for this Buffalo side goes on.

Seattle Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold was selected third overall in the 2018 NFL Draft but had only played in one play-off game before this season

San Francisco's hopes of becoming just the third team to play a Super Bowl in their own stadium were dashed by divisional rivals Seattle.

The Seahawks made a stunning start as wide receiver Rashid Shaheed returned the kick-off for a 95-yard touchdown and they never looked back.

Former 49ers back-up Sam Darnold claimed his first play-off win at the age of 28, making a touchdown pass to league-leading receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba before Kenneth Walker claimed three rushing scores.

After beating San Francisco 13-3 in the final game of the regular season to secure the NFC's top seed, the Seahawks again prevented the injury-hit 49ers from scoring a touchdown.

Seattle, whose defensive coordinator is British coach Aden Durde, put 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy under constant pressure, forcing three turnovers and leading to back-up Mac Jones finishing the game under centre.

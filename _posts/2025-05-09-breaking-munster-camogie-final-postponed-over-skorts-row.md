According to new developments, Cork and Waterford were scheduled to meet on Saturday afternoon

The Munster senior camogie final between Cork and Waterford has been postponed after both panels said that they would wear shorts for the tie. 

The game was due to be staged in Tipperary on Saturday but a statement from Munster camogie chairwoman Christine Ryan on Friday said the committee had "reviewed the situation" amid the ongoing controversy over the sport's rules dictating that players must wear skorts. 

"As the current camogie rules of play are still in place and the players have indicated they would not be prepared to play the game in skorts, the decision has been made to defer the game in the best interests of all players and officials involved," said the statement.

"The details of the rescheduled fixture will be released in due course."

Enforced skort rule in camogie 'screams sexism'

Camogie Association calls vote on skorts issue

Last weekend the Kilkenny and Dublin squads were forced to change into skorts before their Leinster Championship semi-final with both sides told the game would be abandoned after they originally took to the field wearing shorts.

Dublin captain Aisling Maher called it a "career low" and said she was "sick of being forced to wear a skort that is uncomfortable and unfit for purpose".

Following the incident, the Camogie Association called a Special Congress for 22 May to vote on the issue, which if passed would give players the option to wear shorts from 24 May. 

Camogie Association president Brian Molloy said on Thursday: "Our goal is to deliver, as quickly as possible, a best-in-class playing uniform designed for female players and allowing for individual choice."

The sport is governed by the Camogie Association of Ireland which, along with the Ladies Gaelic Football Association is set to be formally integrated into the Gaelic Athletic Association in 2027.

The rule on skorts was previously debated at the Camogie Association's Annual Congress in 2024, although a proposed change did not pass a vote.

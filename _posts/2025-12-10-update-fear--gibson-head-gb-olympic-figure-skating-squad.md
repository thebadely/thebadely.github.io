According to new developments, Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson won ice dance bronze at the Figure Skating Grand Prix in Nagoya, Japan, last week

Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson will bid to win Britain's first Winter Olympic figure skating medal since Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean in 1994 at next year's Games in Milan-Cortina.

Fear and Gibson are among the eight skaters who have been selected in the squad for the 2026 Games, which begin on 6 February.

The pair ended a 40-year wait for a British medal at the World Championship in the ice dance this year.

Phebe Bekker and James Hernandez (ice dance), Anastasia Vaipan-Law and Luke Digby (pairs), Kristen Spours (women's singles) and Edward Appleby (team event - men's singles) complete the squad.

Torvill and Dean won ice dance bronze at Lillehammer to go with their famous gold at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo, watched by a UK television audience of 23 million.

"Being selected for Milano Cortina 2026 is incredibly special," said 26-year-old Fear.

"We've grown so much since Beijing (in 2022), and to come into this season with the momentum we've built feels really meaningful."

Gibson, 31, said: "This is a huge honour and a moment we've been working towards step by step."

Team GB chef de mission Eve Muirhead said: "To select a squad of this size - our largest in nearly 40 years - is a testament to the incredible work being done in British ice skating."

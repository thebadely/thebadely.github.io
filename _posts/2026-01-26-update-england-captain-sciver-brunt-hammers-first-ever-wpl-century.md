Women's Premier League, Vadodara International Cricket Stadium, Vadodara

Mumbai Indians 199-4 (20 overs): Sciver-Brunt 100* (57); Bell 2-21

Scorecard

Nat Sciver-Brunt hit the first century in Women's Premier League history as she helped Mumbai Indians earn a 15-run win over Royal Challengers Bengaluru.

England captain Brunt plundered 16 fours and a six in a 57-ball innings of 100 not out as she helped MI post 199-4 from their 20 overs, while international team-mate Lauren Bell claimed 2-21 for RCB.

Mumbai then restricted RCB to 184-9 despite a 50-ball 90 from Richa Ghosh as Hayley Matthews, who earlier hit 56, finished the pick of the bowlers with 3-10.

All-rounder Sciver-Brunt's knock eclipsed the WPL's previous highest scores of 99 not out and 99 by Georgia Voll and Sophie Devine respectively.

"It was a special moment to get that milestone but, more importantly, the runs on the board for the team," said 33-year-old Sciver-Brunt.

"I was just reacting to the balls that were given to me. Tactically, some bowlers might be more of your strength than others."

Sciver-Brunt is the one of the WPL's best-paid players, earning between Â£320,000âÂ£330,000 having been with Mumbai since the tournament's first season in 2023.

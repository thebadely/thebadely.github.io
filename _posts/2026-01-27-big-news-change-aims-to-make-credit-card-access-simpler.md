Here’s what you need to know: A law change aiming to make it easier for people in Jersey to be approved for a credit card has been praised.

The island's government has backed an amendment to change the way information is shared with UK credit reference agencies, which had been seen as the main barrier to successful applications.

However, it will be up to banks to decide if they wish to re-enter Jersey's credit card market.

Carl Walker, from the Jersey Consumer Council, said it would make the process simpler and he was keeping his "fingers crossed" credit card companies would return to the island.

The amendment allows the government to share people's names and addresses with credit agencies for very specific reasons, including for credit checks and law enforcement.

Opening a debate in the States Assembly, Treasury and Resources Minister Elaine Miller described the change as "exciting".

"It should help finally resolve one of our biggest issues around credit card availability in Jersey," she said.

Deputy Helen Miles, chair of the Corporate Services Scrutiny Panel, called it a "practical step" and agreed the current provision for credit cards was "limited by current rules around data sharing".

She added the panel was satisfied that concerns around privacy had been addressed and an opt-out would be provided for islanders who do not wish to have their information shared with UK credit agencies.

Walker said the Jersey Consumer Council had been calling for this change for a number of years.

"What they've essentially approved is to have a sort of central database," he said.

"It allows at least for them to check that you are a real person, that you do exist, you do live over here and hopefully make that process just that little bit simpler.

"Whether it's too late, whether these credit card companies now can't be bothered to reopen Jersey, we're not sure, but we're keeping our fingers crossed."

It has been recently reported that Some struggling families will miss out on "fantastic" baby bundles from the Welsh government, a charity has warned.

Essential supplies will be delivered to expectant families in some of the most deprived areas of Wales from Monday.

The bundles include clothing for newborns to six-month-olds, blankets, bibs, muslin cloths, a thermometer, a bilingual book and a playmat.

But the Bevan Foundation, and political parties, want the programme to include more families.

The programme is targeted to support the most deprived areas, and midwives can only register a limited number of families who would not qualify but were in need of support.

Mollie Young, from Newport, will be the first expectant mum to receive a baby bundle on 2 Febuary, hand-delivered by Minister for Children and Social Care Dawn Bowden. 

Mollie said: "I was surprised when my midwife told me I could get a parcel of baby clothes and other items before the baby arrives. 

"It's a fantastic idea and a real practical help."

The baby bundles will be available to those in Flying Start catchment areas - a Welsh government programme which targets disadvantaged communities - and contains essential items to support new parents and their babies.

Eligible families can register for one through their midwife, with the bundles delivered between 32 and 34 weeks of pregnancy. 

In Scotland, all newborns have been entitled to a box of essentials - including a mattress and sheets - regardless of parental income or postcode since 2017.  

People in Wales who fall outside the Flying Start catchment areas hope the scheme could become available to all expectant parents.  

Jen Baker, 37, from Roath, Cardiff, said a baby bundle like this would be "hugely beneficial to a lot of people".

Speaking at a playgroup with her two-year-old daughter, Jen said her street was surrounded by postcodes eligible for the Flying Start programme - which provides 12.5 hours of free childcare to two-year-olds - but hers isn't.

She added: "It does say there are more locations that are going to be added to the Flying Start network... but nothing yet."

Jen said the situation was "quite frustrating" as it was "so close within our grasp, because we really could have used that funding, that extra help".

The bundles also include information and advice about parenting and support programmes. 

Jen said receiving the box, especially while pregnant, would be a "real jumping off platform of like what you need, the essentials".

Mabli Siriol Jones, head of poverty policy at the Bevan Foundation think tank, said schemes such as baby bundles which support families with rising costs were a "welcome step towards tackling child poverty".

"However, limiting the scheme to Flying Start areas means that many families who are struggling will miss out," she said. 

The Bevan Foundation said it would like to see the next Welsh government extend the baby bundles scheme to at least all families receiving Universal Credit. 

Bowden said: "The contents have been chosen based on what parents told us in the initial pilot about which items would make the biggest difference to them.

"So, I'm sure Mollie, and the thousands of other parents who will receive baby bundles, will be delighted with them.

"I'm immensely proud that the work that has gone into producing, packing and fulfilling the bundles also supports jobs and businesses here in Wales."

Plaid Cymru MS Sioned Williams said that while the baby bundles were welcomed,  families had been waiting "throughout a crippling cost of living crisis" since the scheme was piloted in 2020.

A Reform spokesperson claimed that children in Wales "have an almost one-in-three chance of being in poverty" under a Labour government.

Welsh Conservative MS Natasha Asghar said: "Our childcare offer recognises the vital role grandparents already play, expands access to free childcare, and gives parents the freedom to choose what works best for their family."

A Welsh Liberal Democrat Spokesperson the government must focus on childcare to give families "real support" and that the "frightening cost of childcare is pushing parents out of work and holding our economy back, and no baby box can fix that on its own". 

Phillip Davies, Wales Green Party deputy leader they "believe these baby boxes should be universal as they already are in Scotland".

Let's dive into the details: Three Barbary macaque monkeys have been born at a sanctuary in Staffordshire.

Fewer than 8,000 of the endangered animals are believed to live in the wild and Trentham Monkey Forest said staff were "beaming from ear to ear" at the new arrivals.

They were discovered by head guide Anna Smith during her morning feeding rounds after being born during the night, high up in the trees.

Ms Smith said finding baby monkeys was always "wonderful" and it was an "absolute privilege" to watch them grow up.

The 60-acre site is home to 140 Barbary macaques and staff had known for a few months that babies were on the way.

The venue said: "Baby Barbary macaques are born with adorable pink faces, black fur and can usually be seen to be clinging tight to mum for love and support during their first hours on Earth."

Park Director Matt Lovatt said the sanctuary was now entering "baby season" and expected to see between six and 10 births a year.

He said: "The new arrivals will be looked after by their fellow group members and start learning the fascinating Barbary macaque way of life from the very first day of their lives."

"We can't wait to see who's next to be welcomed into the world, as we expect more babies to arrive very soon," he added.

Trentham Monkey Forest works with organisations that help protect the wild Barbary macaques in Morocco and Algeria. It said it aimed to raise awareness of the endangered status of the species.

It has been recently reported that President Emmanuel Macron's three-day state visit to the UK features on several front pages, including The Times, which says Sir Keir Starmer will urge the French leader to agree a "one in, one out" migrant returns deal. The arrangement would allow Britain to return migrants who cross the Channel in small boats to France, in exchange for accepting asylum seekers who have a family connection in the UK.

The Daily Mail accuses the French police of doing "nothing" to stop small boat crossings and calls on Macron to hand back £771m of British taxpayers' money given to France to address the issue.

The Daily Telegraph focuses on the speech of King Charles III at tonight's state banquet, where he will stress the vital partnership between the UK and France. The paper's leader column argues that a cast-iron agreement to return small boat arrivals to France is the "only" way to halt the daily influx of illegal immigrants and urges Macron to realise that a workable deal is overwhelmingly in the interests of both countries. The Daily Express says Macron's visit offers time to "nail" the problem. It calls on Sir Keir to "get tough" with the French.

The Sun reports that a leaked memo has revealed that the FBI has closed its investigation into associates of convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. With the headline, "Air Miles Andy Cleared For Take-Off", it says Prince Andrew can now end his self-imposed travel ban, as he will feel it is "safe" to leave the UK. The Duke of York has always denied all the accusations made against him with regards to his links to Epstein. The Daily Mirror says the FBI's decision to end its inquiry has deepened the agony for victims of the late financier.

The Times highlights how airports have begun "quietly lifting" the 100ml restriction on liquids in hand luggage. It says the move is "risking confusion" over the peak summer holiday period as passengers at Birmingham and Edinburgh can now take two litres in cabin bags – but elsewhere the rules remain strict. The Department for Transport says holidaymakers should check the website of their airport before packing any hand luggage.

According to new developments, Elisabeth Terland (left) has scored seven goals in European qualifying this season

The journey is just beginning for Manchester United.

They have come through four qualifying matches to reach the main draw of the Women's Champions League for the first time - but do not want to stop there.

Marc Skinner's side wrapped up a 3-1 aggregate victory over Brann on Thursday night thanks to Elisabeth Terland's hat-trick, but will have to go up another gear when they face Europe's elite in the new-look competition.

Testing their squad depth, Skinner's rotation, how they handle travelling long distances and coming up against better-quality opposition - it is a new challenge for United.

"We are history makers and that's really important to stress. I said to the players that we can't just go in [the draw] and make up the numbers," said Skinner.

"We have to be really excited by the opportunity of playing against Europe's best teams. If you want to be there, you have to perform against them. 

"Whatever the draw is, I hope that the teams who get us think they didn't want to play Manchester United."

Manchester United, who only reformed their women's team in 2018, finished third in the Women's Super League (WSL) last season to reach the Champions League qualifying stage, where they fell in 2023 with defeat by Paris St-Germain. 

Their qualifying opponents this year - PSV, Hammarby and Brann - were considered easier opposition, but United still had to overturn a 1-0 deficit from the first leg in the third qualifying round against Norwegian side Brann.

They join WSL champions Chelsea and European winners Arsenal in the main draw on Friday (11:00 BST) - and Skinner hopes nobody will want to face United.

"We won't be seeded so if you're the team playing against us, hopefully you think 'hmm, that's tricky for us'," he added. 

"I just think it was now or never [to get into the main draw]. We needed to do it. I felt we had the quality. 

"It's something I want to experience. I want to challenge in the European competition against the best teams."

United have so far managed their busy schedule well, winning their two opening WSL games and progressing though four qualifying matches in Europe.

Skinner hopes his experience of travelling long distances while managing in the United States, and the addition of Sweden duo Fridolina Rolfo and Julia Zigiotti, will help them navigate the challenges of playing in the Champions League.

Rolfo, in particular, won two European titles with Barcelona and played in a further three Champions League finals before joining United in August. 

But despite adding quality, Skinner insists United will need to shop again in January to go far in the competition.

"It's a totally different challenge but one we're looking forward to. We have the players who have that experience, as we added that," said Skinner. 

"We need a bigger squad, there is no doubt about that. But I can't do anything about it now. The players are embracing it. 

"I'm going to stress - in the winter window we need to strengthen the squad."

In Terland, United have a player who looks ready for the Champions League. 

She was the star of the show at Leigh Sports Village on Thursday, scoring with both feet and a header to complete a perfect hat-trick. 

"She's one of the best finishers I've ever worked with. We've just put her in spaces to finish effectively," said Skinner.

"The first goal, it is a snapshot and the keeper doesn't see it before it's gone in the net. She has a really short backlift and fires quickly so that catches people by surprise. 

"She is so intelligent in the box. She's always thinking and that's the detail."

Terland played for Brann between 2021 and 2022 and Skinner said she received some stick from home supporters on her return to Norway in their first-leg defeat.

But she bounced back emphatically, silencing a small crowd of travelling Brann fans with her ruthless display in the second leg.

"I think she was fired up. She maybe got a little bit of winding up. Tonight she answered that - I'm really proud of her," said Skinner. 

"To take those goals shows the quality of the player she is. Last week it maybe affected her a little bit too much, but to answer it the way she has shows you she is able to overcome psychological challenges. 

"She just needs to perform with her football and the rest does the talking. She's really important to us. I see a bright future and a lot of goals for her."

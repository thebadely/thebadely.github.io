Scorecard

Pakistan hammered Australia by 111 runs in Lahore to seal a 3-0 series sweep and inflict the tourists' biggest defeat in T20 internationals.

The hosts posted 207-6, with Saim Ayub and Babar Azam both scoring half-centuries and Shadab Khan crashing 46 from 19 balls.

Spinner Mohammad Nawaz then took career-best figures of 5-18 as Australia were bundled out for just 96 in 16.5 overs.

The margin was 11 runs worse than Australia's previous record defeat, when they were thrashed England by 100 runs in their second-ever T20 international in 2005.

Sunday's loss meant the tourists had failed to chase a target for a third match in succession, having suffered 90 and 22-run defeats earlier in the week.

Marcus Stoinis top-scored with 23 from 22 deliveries, and was one of only three Australian batters to make it into double figures.

Earlier, Saim (56) and Babar (50 not out) put on 69 for the third wicket as the hosts reached a competitive score having won the toss and choosing to bat.

It was Babar's first significant score since he left the Big Bash League early, having drawn criticism for his slow-scoring in his first season in the competition.

Both sides have now completed their preparations for the T20 World Cup, with Australia starting against Ireland on Wednesday, 11 February.

Pakistan open with a fixture against the Netherlands on Saturday, but the Pakistan Cricket Board have announced that they will not fulfil their group stage fixture against India on Sunday, 15 February.

Elsewhere, England will face defending champions Australia in the semi-finals of the Under-19 World Cup on Tuesday after India sealed top spot in their super six group and their place in the knockouts with a 58-run win over Pakistan.

Starting the final match of the group stage, India knew only a heavy defeat would see Pakistan reach the knockouts in their place, but a win and a closer loss would each result in a different semi-final opponent.

By beating their rivals, India moved above England on net run-rate and will now place Afghanistan in the second semi-final on Wednesday.

Chasing 253, Pakistan may had looked well set for victory after Usman Khan (66) and Farhan Yousuf (38) put on 63 to leave them 151-2 in the 30th over.

However, they lost their last eight wickets for 43 runs and were bowled out for 194 in the 47th over, and finish third in the group.

Let's dive into the details: Teenager Endrick has fallen out of favour with Real Madrid and Brazil

He was supposed to be Brazil's next superstar and part of Real Madrid's new era of Galacticos, but Endrick's career has hit a stumbling block.

The 19-year-old enjoyed a promising first season at Real Madrid, making 37 appearances - albeit the majority came from the substitutes' bench.

But things aren't looking as positive under new manager Xabi Alonso.

Endrick has played just 14 minutes in a single appearance this term, coming on as a late substitute in a 4-0 victory over Valencia.

And now, for the fourth international window in a row, the teenager has been left out of Brazil's squad by his former Real boss Carlo Ancelotti.

With his playing time almost non-existent, a World Cup on the horizon and a loan move being mooted, BBC Sport looks at what has gone wrong for Endrick and what happens next.

Who is Brazil's history maker and Real Madrid's next star Endrick?

Endrick joined Real Madrid shortly after his 18th birthday in July 2024, which was 18 months after Real agreed a deal with Brazilian side Palmeiras.

At the time of his arrival in Spain, he had already made 10 appearances and scored three goals for Brazil.

Endrick scored seven goals in his first season at Real - three more than compatriot Vinicius Jr managed in his own debut campaign - but he was mainly used off the bench and was limited to just 352 minutes in La Liga.

With Ancelotti leaving for the Brazil job, a new era under Alonso seemed to offer a fresh opportunity for Endrick to prove his worth.

However, he suffered a hamstring injury in May which ruled him out of the Club World Cup, while a recurrence of the same injury saw him miss the start of the season.

He returned on 20 September but ended up as an unused substitute in Real's next six matches before his 14-minute cameo against Valencia last week.

Spanish football expert Guillem Balague told BBC Sport that Alonso sees Endrick as a forward with plenty to offer - if not now, then before long.

"Alonso recognises he has a good relationship with the goal, it is easy for him to score, but there are priorities," Balague said.

"Gonzalo Garcia gives him more because he holds the ball well. He is more linked to the team, whereas Endrick is a finisher and hasn't managed to get into the dynamics of the team.

"A lot of things suggest he is not ready for now but he can be in the near future. He will be a regular goalscorer, but you start to wonder if the players ahead of him will get in his way. He is at this stage of his career where he becomes a Real Madrid player or a very good professional somewhere else."

While sources are indicating there has yet to be a final decision on whether Endrick leaves on loan when the January transfer window opens, it is understood Real are reluctantly giving consideration to sanctioning a move.

Endrick is settled in the Spanish capital and enjoying life in mainland Europe.

There is a belief that remaining in Madrid, despite his current lack of first-team minutes, would benefit the youngster in the long term as he continues his transition to senior football in a foreign country as a teenager.

But there are other factors to consider.

The first, and most obvious, is linked to his development. His lack of first-team action under Alonso was not envisaged as part of the player's perceived pathway at Real.

There would be an obvious benefit for Endrick to leave and play senior football on more of a regular basis simply in terms of his growth as a teenage footballer.

The fact the World Cup is on the horizon provides Endrick with another reason to seriously think about leaving in January.

His lack of action under Alonso, should it continue, may scupper hopes of working his way back into Ancelotti's Brazil plans in time for the summer.

Then there is the emergence of Estevao Willian at Chelsea. Not long ago, Endrick was the undisputed wonderkid of Brazilian football.

The coming of age of Estevao at Chelsea this season has seen the 18-year-old - who played with Endrick at Palmeiras - become the new apple of the Brazilian public's eye.

So what should Endrick do? It's a tough call for a young man to make.

Balague said: "In the previous winter, a year ago, there was the possibility of going on loan but it was decided it was not going to be the case.

"In the summer, the club were sounding him out about a loan but he didn't want to go out, because he thought staying at Real Madrid was a quicker way of getting into the national side, even if he didn't play regularly. But now he hasn't been called up for Brazil."

Work on identifying potential destinations for Endrick is under way.

Intriguingly, a number of Premier League clubs are understood to have been made aware of his possible availability.

Similarly, clubs from other top European leagues have also been alerted to the situation that may be on the horizon.

For example, French club Lyon are among the clubs to have shown a firm interest.

"A Lyon loan is certainly a possibility because they are in the Europa League and he will play regularly. He then wants to come back and succeed at Real Madrid," said Balague.

It will be intriguing to see which division and club Endrick selects.

While the global appeal of the Premier League would attract the biggest set of eyes, the demanding and physical nature of England's top flight may not suit a player of the Brazilian's inexperience.

For example, if Endrick is open to moving to England it is understood West Ham would be among the clubs interested in a loan.

But you would have to wonder whether joining a team fighting relegation under the pragmatic leadership of Nuno Espirito Santo would suit Endrick's attacking talent.

Chelsea have been interested in Endrick in the past, but with the Blues now well stocked in attack there are no indications they would want to bring him in now.

Aston Villa have been credited with an interest in recent days, but it is understood Monchi's recent departure as sporting director may hinder any potential move.

It is key to stress that when a potential loan move for Endrick was first mooted earlier this year, Real made it clear that they had no intention of sanctioning his departure.

Of course, their stance may have changed given his limited game time.

Whether Real would provide clearance for a January exit will become clearer in the coming weeks.

Any loan departure would come with an element of risk.

Success elsewhere could persuade Alonso that Endrick is ready for a more significant role in his plans.

On the flip side, a failed or difficult move could lead to negativity over Endrick's long-term ambitions in Madrid.

However, Endrick is young enough not to be defined by the next eight months, whether he spends that time in Spain or elsewhere.

Those close to Endrick are acutely aware of the pros and cons of any January move, and in many ways the safest bet would be to stay at Real.

Having spent up to â¬72million (Â£63m) on Endrick, a deal that made the youngster one of the most expensive teenagers of all time, Real clearly want to protect their investment.

While the benefits of Endrick playing and scoring for another club could aid the long-term plan for the teenager to become a genuine Galactico, an ineffective transfer could affect the forward's value and dent his confidence.

Alonso, approaching his first mid-season window as Madrid boss, could still make all this talk moot by thrusting Endrick into more first-team action before the winter break.

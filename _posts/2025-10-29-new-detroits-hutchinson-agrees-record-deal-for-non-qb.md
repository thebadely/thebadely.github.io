Here’s what you need to know: Aidan Hutchinson is tied for seventh in the NFL for sacks this season (six)

NFL 2025 season: Week nine

Aidan Hutchinson has agreed a four-year contract extension with the Detroit Lions which includes an NFL record for the highest guaranteed salary for a non-quarterback.

The defensive end's new contract is worth a total of $180m (Â£135.9m), with $141m (Â£106.5m) guaranteed.

Micah Parsons remains the NFL's highest-paid non-quarterback after being traded to the Green Bay Packers in August, but his contract is worth less in guaranteed money. 

Hutchinson and Parsons are two of the NFL's best pass rushers, with the Lions star having picked up from where he left off after missing most of last season with a severe leg injury.

The 25-year-old, who was in the last year of his rookie deal - having been drafted by Detroit with the second overall pick in 2022, has claimed six sacks from seven games this season.

Hutchinson has registered 34.5 sacks in 46 games overall, helping them claim their first play-off win in 32 years en route to the NFC Championship game at the end of the 2023 season, which they lost 34-31 to the San Francisco 49ers.

The Lions have such an aggressive defensive front, the way they fly around the ball, and having Hutchinson back is a major factor in that.

He's tied with Joey Bosa for the most forced fumbles (4) this season.

He's also third in the league for quarterback pressures (39), and that's behind only Micah Parsons (44) and Nik Bonitto (40) - two of the best in the business.

Hutchinson has helped to transform the Lions into play-off contenders over the past three seasons and they nearly reached the Super Bowl in his second season.

He is the latest key player to sign an extension so Detroit look set to remain a force for years to come.

Experts revealed that Gloucester-Hartpury have maximum points from their first five games of the Premiership Women's Rugby season

Gloucester-Hartpury moved back clear at the top of the Premiership Women's Rugby table with a thumping 54-14 win at Bristol Bears. 

Saracens had joined the reigning champions at the top, level on 20 points, on Saturday with a similarly one-sided 57-5 victory in the London derby at Trailfinders. 

But a bonus-point win on Sunday that included eight tries from eight different scorers moved Gloucester-Hartpury five points clear at the summit once again. 

Elsewhere, Leicester Tigers' losing run continued with a 38-10 defeat at Loughborough Lightning, while Exeter Chiefs' game against Sale Sharks ended in a 26-26 draw.

Gloucester-Hartpury were out of sight by half-time after scoring 35 unanswered points in the opening period of Sunday's only PWR fixture. 

Sam Monaghan started the onslaught in the fourth minute and further scores followed from Mia Venner, El Perry, Tatyana Heard and Sarah Beckett before the break.

Bristol made it to last season's play-off semi-finals, where they lost to Gloucester-Hartpury, but their latest campaign has started badly and they find themselves second-bottom after four games. 

The second half did not start any better for the hosts as Bethan Lewis went over for the defending champions with just 42 minutes on the clock. 

Evie Gallagher finally put some points on the board for Bristol in the 54th minute, but Gloucester-Hartpury responded with further scores from Rachel Lund and Nel Metcalfe before Lucy Skuse added a late consolation try for the home side.     

Zoe Harrison has the best kicking success rate in the Premiership

On Saturday, Saracens' nine tries were scored by eight different players, with World Cup winner May Campbell crossing twice and her England team-mate Zoe Harrison kicking 12 points of extras.

In search of their third successive win, Trailfinders opened the scoring at their home ground but only entered their opponents' 22 once more amid a dominant Saracens' performance.

Francesca McGhie got Trailfinders off the mark inside three minutes but visitors Saracens replied quickly, going level with a score from Sydney Gregson.

With relentless attacking play, Saracens turned their trailing start into a 26-point half-time advantage with further tries from Marlie Packer, Alysha Corrigan, Lotte Sharp and Campbell.

There was no respite for the hosts as Poppy Cleall put Saracens further ahead after the break, finishing off a driving maul to make it 36-5. 

Campbell scored her second of the game before ex-Trailfinders prop Liz Crake added to her former side's difficulties with Saracens' eighth try. 

There was time enough for Jess Breach to have her say and the world champion finished a blistering counter-attack in the final minutes to round off the scoring for Saracens. 

Bo Westcombe-Evans has scored 39 tries in 50 appearances for Loughborough Lightning

Leicester Tigers were first on the board at Franklin's Gardens, home to Loughborough Lightning, as Georgie Lingham scored in the fourth minute of the game. 

Plunged into her Premiership debut by an early substitution, Loughborough full-back Lucia Scott scored with her first touch in the league, showing pace to dot down a grubber provided by club veteran Bo Westcombe-Evans. 

It was a productive afternoon for Westcombe-Evans who, on her 50th appearance for Loughborough, crossed four times to claim half of the hosts' eight-try haul. 

There were signs of hope for bottom-placed Tigers, who scored three tries for just the second time this season, and had a fourth - a cheeky set-piece - ruled out for a knock-on before the break. 

With a burst of pace, Tigers' Jemima McCalman also came close to advancing the visitors' bid for a bonus point in the second half - but was denied by a try-saving tackle from debutant Scott, 21.

The Tigers' hunt for a first point of the season continues as Loughborough ended the East Midlands derby 38-10 winners.

"That was a lot of fun," Westcombe-Evans said after the game. "It meant a lot to me on my 50th cap." 

"I hoped to score one or two, but four is pretty cool."

Exeter Chiefs settled for their second draw of the season away at Sale Sharks' Morson Stadium, where a battling contest ended 26-26.

The teams scored two tries apiece in the first half, which the visitors ended with a narrow 14-12 lead.

Chasing their second win of the season, Sale opened up a 12-point advantage after the break with tries from Gwen Pyrs and Morwenna Talling.

But a yellow card allowed Exeter back into the game, as a converted try scored by Emily Robinson put the visitors back within touching distance while Sale lock Charlotte Fray was in the sin bin for a high tackle. 

In the end, the game was decided from the tee. With Sale 26-21 up, World Cup winner Holly Aitchinson passed up a chance to extend their lead by missing a penalty with 10 minutes to play.

Hope Rogers crossed to bring Chiefs level, and so it stayed after Exeter missed the extras. Given a second chance to nudge Sale ahead at the death, Aitchinson missed a penalty in added time and so the teams were tied at the whistle.

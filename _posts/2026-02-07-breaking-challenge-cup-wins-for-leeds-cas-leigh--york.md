It has been recently reported that George Brown's two tries on debut sparked Leeds Rhinos' Challenge Cup win at Widnes Vikings.

George Brown scored two tries on his debut as Leeds Rhinos saw off a fierce challenge from Widnes Vikings to win 25-12 at the DCBL Stadium and reach the fourth round of the Challenge Cup.

The 18-year-old full-back was handed his bow after impressing in pre-season and took just seven minutes to get on the scoresheet, with Kallum Watkins converting, although winger Mike Butt's try and a Jordan Abdull two-pointer levelled it up.

Leeds looked like easing away with the tie, as Watkins kicked a penalty and another debutant, former Canberra Raiders hooker Danny Levi, added another try, before Brown's second had the Super League club 18-6 up at half-time.

Vikings hit back as Joe Lyons sent Butt over for his second try, but Riley Lumb's brilliant solo try, Watkins' conversion, and Brodie Croft's drop-goal made sure Leeds would be in the hat.

Castleford Tigers eased into the draw for the fourth round with a 14-0 victory at Championship side Doncaster.

The Super League side were held in a tight first quarter, but Joe Stimson made the breakthrough and Tom Weaver's conversion had them ahead at the interval.

Doncaster survived the sin-binning of Titus Gwaze for interference at the play-the-ball, but Tigers full-back Blake Taaffe added another try, and with Weaver kicking the extras and a penalty, they coasted to the finish line with no real alarm.

Super League newcomers York Knights scored seven tries against old Championship rivals Barrow Raiders, as Australian utility player Nikau Williams marked his return to the club with 10 points in a 32-6 win at North Wales Crusaders.

Samoa international Toa Mata'afa and Williams, who scored 10 tries in his first spell at the club two years ago, put York in charge but Barrow's Greg Richards and Knights' Paul McShane were red-carded following a brawl.

Luke Cresswell hit back with a Raiders try but Jack Martin's instant reply and Liam Harris' successful conversion - his only one out of five attempts - made it 14-6 at half-time to the visitors.

Williams danced through for his second try and later added a conversion, Jesse Dee and Oli Field added one each, and Paul Vaughan scored his first try since his move from Warrington Wolves to make it an emphatic win.

Leigh Leopards made it a clean sweep for the Super League clubs with 11 tries in a 60-6 win in front of North Wales Crusaders' record attendance of 1,899 at Eirias Stadium in Colwyn Bay.

Josh Charnley began what could be his final season in rugby league with two tries, with Edwin Ipape and Lachlan Lam also claiming doubles.

Tries from Owen Trout, Ipape, Jacob Alick-Wiencke and Charnley had Leigh 18-6 up at half-time, and they ran away with it after the break as Charnley and Ipape added their second trie, and Keanan Brand, Frankie Halton, Lam's quick double and Andrew Badrock all got in on the act. Adam Cook added eight conversions.

It has been recently reported that Luke Littler is the World Series of Darts defending champion

Defending champion Luke Littler had to come from behind to beat Jonny Clayton 6-4 and advance to the World Series of Darts quarter-finals.

Clayton stormed into a 3-0 lead but Littler responded, winning the next five legs, which included back-to-back 180s, before seeing out victory in Amsterdam.

Littler will face Ross Smith, a 6-4 winner over Dave Chisnall, next.

"It was not easy and I can pull myself out of situations, I know I can do it," said Littler.

"I would rather get off to a good start, but Jonny did there. I managed to get over the line."

Elsewhere, Michael van Gerwen hit back-to-back 100-plus finishes to edge out Rob Cross 6-5, setting up a quarter-final against Luke Humphries, the world number one coming through 6-4 against Kevin Doets.

Gerwyn Price beat Raymond van Barneveld 6-4, setting up a tie with Chris Dobey, who cruised to a 6-1 win over Cameron Menzies.

The remaining quarter-final sees Josh Rock, who routed Danny Noppert 6-0 in a match that lasted just nine minutes, take on Mike de Decker after he beat Damon Heta 6-4.

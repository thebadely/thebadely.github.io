Here’s what you need to know: Many of the papers consider the toppling of the French prime minister François Bayrou in last night's confidence vote. The Financial Times says the outcome of the vote puts pressure on President Macron to stem a spiralling political crisis. The Guardian notes that Macron will have to appoint his third prime minister in only one year. The Times says the left and right of French politics have united and warned him that if he appoints someone from his centrist camp, they would immediately be ousted.

The i Paper is more interested in the political difficulties facing our own prime minister, as his party begins its search for a new deputy leader. "Labour left plots revenge on Starmer" is its headline. The Daily Express says left-wingers have accused Sir Keir of trying to meddle with the rules to ensure one of his chosen candidates is selected. The Daily Mail believes Labour is on the brink of civil war. The Daily Mirror says the modern Labour party must reflect the country it seeks to govern.

The Daily Telegraph says the Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch will challenge Sir Keir Starmer to work with her party on a plan to cut the welfare bill. The paper says she will warn him that his only chance of getting significant welfare savings through the Commons is by working with the Tories. The Daily Express says that if Labour backbenchers want to stop saddling future generations with debt, they need to listen to her.

The Guardian says it has seen a trove of leaked documents from the office of the former prime minister Boris Johnson which, it says, suggests that he has used a publicly subsidised company to manage an array of highly paid jobs and business ventures. The paper says he has not responded to multiple requests for comment. The BBC has not verified the existence or content of what the Guardian calls the Boris Files.

"Just seven miles apart, but there's still a chasm between the warring princes" is the Daily Mail's take on the fact that Prince Harry was in England to mark the third anniversary of Queen Elizabeth's death yesterday, but didn't meet up with his estranged brother. The Daily Mirror said that at an awards ceremony for seriously ill youngsters, Harry joked to one child: "Does your sibling drive you mad?"

Scorecard; Table

India secured the final spot in the World Cup semi-finals and eliminated New Zealand and Sri Lanka with a 53-run victory (DLS) over the White Ferns in Navi Mumbai.

The co-hosts had been in danger of missing out on the last four of the 50-over competition for the third time in four editions, heading into their penultimate group match on a run of three consecutive defeats.

New Zealand, meanwhile, level with India on four points, had seen their campaign disrupted by the weather, with their past two matches abandoned due to rain after winning one of their opening three.

More wet weather briefly threatened to frustrate both sides, with a 90-minute delay at the backend of India's innings reducing the game to 49 overs per side before a second delay saw New Zealand's chase adjusted to 325 from 44 overs.

However, India comfortably secured the required two points to join Australia, South Africa, and England in the knockout stages, with centuries from Pratika Rawal â whose 122 (134) is the second-highest score of the tournament â and Smriti Mandhana (109 off 95) helping India post 340-3. New Zealand could only make 271-8 in reply. 

Although New Zealand and Sri Lanka could join them on six points if they win their final group matches and India lose to Bangladesh, neither side can match India's three wins, which is the first criteria used to separate sides.

Mandhana and Rawal were rarely troubled by New Zealand's bowlers, effortlessly piling on 212 for the first wicket, while Jemimah Rodrigues contributed a quickfire 76 (55) as India compiled the highest total of the tournament.

In reply, New Zealand lost experienced duo Suzie Bates and captain Sophie Devine for single-figure scores as they slipped to 59-3. 

However, Brooke Halliday and Izzy Gaze scored half-centuries from the middle order, the latter from an eye-catching 39 balls, as the White Ferns went down fighting.

This was must-win territory for both teams, but the bulk of the pressure was on India. Searching for their maiden Women's World Cup crown, they headed into this tournament, on home soil, as title favourites alongside Australia and England.

Comfortable victories over Sri Lanka and Pakistan gave them the ideal start but then they faltered, suffering consecutive defeats to South Africa, Australia, and England â and on all three occasions, they were left to rue what might have been.

They reduced South Africa to 81-5 chasing 252 before being blown away by Nadine de Klerk. They failed to defend 330 against Australia, having earlier lost 36-6 at the back end of their innings. Against England, they failed to chase 289 despite needing a manageable 62 runs from the final 10 overs â they lost by four runs.

But they returned to winning ways with a ruthless batting display against New Zealand.

At the top of the order, Mandhana passed 50 for the third consecutive innings while Rawal now has a hundred to go with her half-century against Australia. Both players showed good patience as they weathered the swing of Rosemary Mair and Jess Kerr early in the powerplay before settling into serene partnership against a toothless New Zealand attack.

Rodrigues, meanwhile, seized her opportunity after being promoted up the order, scoring freely around the ground as she became the seventh India player to pass 50 at the tournament.

Combined, India's batters hit 42 boundaries and scored at just under seven an over.

However, the same ruthlessness was not on display during New Zealand's chase. 

They dropped several catches, gave up boundaries with ease, and never looked like bowling New Zealand out despite removing three of their top four inside 12 overs.

While Gaze's onslaught came too late to put the hosts in any danger of losing, India failed to deliver the statement performance which would reaffirm their status as serious title contenders.

New Zealand captain Sophie Devine: "We are incredibly disappointed. It has been a frustrating tournament and we wanted more opportunities.

"Credit to India today. I am so proud of how the girls continued to fight. With a full 50 overs, could we have got closer? Maybe. Absolutely gutted.

"We are playing nations that have 1.4 billion people and we have 5 million. We have to remember that."

India captain Harmanpreet Kaur: "It wasn't easy. Credit goes to the entire team, the way we fought today, we knew how important this game was.

"We were getting starts, now it's time to make it big. Credit goes to Pratika and Smriti. The team stood up, we lifted each other after the last three games didn't go well.

"Whenever you play at home, everyone expects a lot from you. We are always discussing as a team that this is our home, the crowd is cheering for you, this a time to enjoy."

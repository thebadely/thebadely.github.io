It has been recently reported that Marketa Vondrousova became Wimbledon champion in 2023

Marketa Vondrousova claimed her first title since winning Wimbledon two years ago after she beat Chinese qualifier Wang Xinyu in the Berlin Open final.

The 25-year-old Czech has struggled with injury over the last year but put that behind her to win 7-6 (12-10) 4-6 6-2.

She saved six set points in a tight first-set tie-break but came through that to take the opener.

Wang, 23, had seen off four top-20 players to reach her first-ever tour final and she showed great resolve to get a break in the second set and level.

But Vondrousova dominated the decider, getting the double break to send her on the way to a third career title and ensure she heads into Wimbledon with confidence.

"It was nice to see a full crowd. I really enjoyed the tennis this week and the support," Vondrousova said.

Meanwhile, British doubles number one Olivia Nicholls partnered Tereza Mihalikova of Slovakia to win the doubles final as they beat top seeds Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini of Italy 4-6 6-2 10-6.

Alexander Bublik is a two-time winner of the Halle Open

Alexander Bublik continued his impressive recent form by beating former world number one Daniil Medvedev 6-3 7-6 (7-4)  to win the Halle Open.

The Kazakhstan player had seen off world number one Jannik Sinner in the last 16 and this victory was his first in seven attempts against Medvedev.

It took him one hour and 22 minutes to secure the win, which was his fifth ATP Tour title and his second in Halle after his 2023 win.

Russian Medvedev, meanwhile, has now lost his last six Tour-level finals.

With the win Bublik will rise to 30th in the world, having been outside the top 75 just one month ago.

"I had such tough months since last Wimbledon to probably this summer," he said.

"I was close to calling it quits after Wimbledon because I was not enjoying it anymore. Now this is happening. I don't know. Quarters at the French. Winner here. I have no words."

It has been recently reported that Nate Diaz last fought in MMA in 2022 and has 21-13 record

Nate Diaz has dropped out of doing a reality TV show with Jon Jones after there was a melee on set in Thailand.

The UFC stars were set to be opposing coaches on a Russian version of The Ultimate Fighter.

Diaz, 40, arrived in Thailand this week, but a scuffle broke out involving several of his team on the first day of filming.

"We had one of our young fighters, a guy named Zalik, he was playing with Nate," Jones told Red Corner MMA. , external

"He wanted to play-fight with Nate.

"Nate kind of came in a little bit on edge, I think he had some previous beef with some Russian fighters, so he was a little bit on edge when he got here. 

"Play-fighting with Nate was not the best idea. It became serious right away, and we had to replace Nate."

Jake Shields, who flew with Diaz to Thailand, said the American "slapped" the individual who tried to grab him before several more people got involved.

Video has since emerged of the altercation, showing Jones tried to play peacemaker when the first melee happened before a second incident broke out later.

Jones will continue filming the reality show. The UFC heavyweight champion has refused to confirm whether he is officially retired or not while interim belt holder Tom Aspinall waits to find out if he will fight the American.

Diaz left the UFC in 2022 and has competed in two boxing matches since then against Jake Paul and his former MMA rival Jorge Masvidal.

According to new developments, Wigan Warriors have enjoyed a superb season

Betfred Women's Super League Grand Final

Wigan Warriors (4) 16

Tries: Davies 2, Jones 2 

St Helens (8) 12

Tries: McGifford, Hook 2 

Wigan Warriors won their first treble in the women's game by coming from behind to beat St Helens in the Grand Final at the Brick Community Stadium.

In front of a record crowd of 5,018, Saints looked set to upset the odds at half-time, after tries from Dani McGifford and Phoebe Hook answered Anna Davies' opener for the Warriors, who had already secured the Challenge Cup and League Leaders' Shield.

After the break, however, Wigan stepped up a gear, with Molly Jones going over for two tries in the space of five minutes to turn the game on its head before Davies raced away for her second to give Wigan breathing space.

Saints, who were beaten in the Challenge Cup final at Wembley and pipped for the League Leaders' Shield, rallied with Hook's second try but could not stop Wigan winning their first Grand Final since 2018.

Saints were underdogs going into the game after being hammered 42-6 at Wembley in June, but the way they bounced back in Super League to earn a 22-22 draw and then narrowly lose 24-20 to push Wigan all the way indicated that this would be a tough encounter for both, and so it proved.

Wigan's dangerous backs were up against Saints' powerhouse pack, and that led to a tight, tense first half in which both sides defended with discipline and determination.

Grace Banks was denied an opening try for Wigan when a video review spotted an obstruction in the build-up, and then Rebecca Rotheram's fine tackle stopped Jenna Foubister racing clear as Saints were on the back foot.

Winger Davies kept up her record of scoring in every game against Saints this season, bursting through two would-be tacklers and going over in the corner, but it was all square when Banks spilled a Faye Gaskin high bomb and Saints quickly moved it left to give McGifford her 20th try of the Super League season.

Saints took a half-time lead when they again shifted the ball quickly and Hook went over in the corner.

Wigan were facing only their second defeat of the season but reacted like champions, forcing Saints into a goal-line drop-out and then quickly shifting it left for Jones to level the score.

Five minutes later, Jones put in a repeat, scooting over after more slick handling and as the Saints defence tired the pace and power of Davies proved too much as the England player stormed down the right to score another in the corner.

Saints dug deep to push Wigan back in the closing stages and Hook forced her way over through sheer willpower, but with Gaskin missing all of her conversions from wide out, as did Isobel Rowe for Wigan, it was not enough to stop the Warriors.

Wigan Warriors boss Denis Betts told BBC Radio Manchester:

"You could tell in the first half we looked nervy and edgy in our halves. I think what you saw in the first half was that feeling had been taken away that we went to Wembley with and we became a little bit apprehensive, but we're a really young side.

"The consistency this year considering the age of the group has been outstanding. I wasn't expecting them to compete at this level. 

"The exciting thing is they've learned from this, they know how to dig in and win a game and it doesn't always have to be fancy stuff, it can be about just working hard and we've done that a couple of times this year. 

"To be where we are is a real testament to the group itself because it's a really young group."

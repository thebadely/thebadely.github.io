According to new developments, The mother of Baby P has told her parole hearing she believes she would be a risk to children in her care, admitting that she was a "bad mother".

Tracey Connelly was sentenced in 2009 to a minimum term of five years after admitting causing or allowing the death of her 17-month-old son Peter - known as Baby P - at their home in Tottenham, north London. He died on 3 August 2007 after months of abuse.

Her then boyfriend, Steven Barker, and his brother, Jason Owen, were convicted of the same crime.

Connelly's parole hearing is her seventh review for release and second review since she was recalled to prison in August last year - the second such recall - for breaching her licence conditions.

Peter Connelly suffered more than 50 injuries, including fractured ribs and a broken back, despite being on the at-risk register and receiving 60 visits from social workers, police officers and health professionals over eight months.

Giving evidence to her public parole hearing off camera, Connelly said she "knew deep down" that Barker had been abusing her son but she wanted her "Prince Charming", and her children "paid for that".

Asked if she perceived herself as being a risk to children, Connelly replied: "Children in my care? Yes.

"Given how bad I was at it, I have to always accept that there is always a risk if I am left looking after children, which I can't see ever being the case.

"Am I a risk to children walking down the street? No."

Speaking of how she had performed as a parent, Connelly admitted: "I was a bad mother.

"I failed to protect them, I put my needs first, I took all my anger at the world on my older children. I didn't give them what they needed and they deserve a whole lot better than me."

Connelly, now in her 40s, told the panel she would not enter into a relationship with someone who had regular contact with children.

She added: "I don't want to be around other people's children or grandchildren."

Connelly was recalled to prison last year after she started a relationship with a man she had met online, without telling the officials who were supervising her.

Wednesday's hearing was told the situation "closely mirrored" that of her first recall and her conduct in custody, where she also developed intimate relationships.

The parole hearing panel was told by her prison offender manager (POM) that Connelly had deleted material from her phone to avoid officials finding out about her relationship, which led to her second recall.

The panel's chairwoman, Sally Allbeury, said Connelly was "perfectly entitled" to get involved in any kind of relationship she wanted, as long as she was open about it.

Connelly's POM is recommending she should be released with a management plan.

Ms Allbeury said the panel had heard "extremely moving" victim statements from Baby P's loved ones.

"There can be no doubt that Peter's death has caused lifelong harm to those who loved him," she said.

Options open to the panel include allowing Connolly's release or recommending her transfer to an open prison.

Connolly was first released on licence in 2013 but was recalled to prison in 2015 for breaching her parole conditions. She was freed for a second time in July 2022 and recalled again two years later.

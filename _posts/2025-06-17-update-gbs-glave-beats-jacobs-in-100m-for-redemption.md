It has been recently reported that Glave took bronze in the 100m final at the 2024 European Championship

Great Britain's Romell Glave topped a field including Andre de Grasse and Marcell Jacobs to win the men's 100m final at the Paavo Nurmi Games in Finland.

Glave won with a time of 10.08 seconds, with Canada's Jerome Blake and Ghana's Benjamin Azamati coming in at 10.09 and 10.10 respectively.

Canada's De Grasse - Tokyo 2020 Olympics 200m gold medallist - came sixth at the World Athletics Continental Tour Gold meeting in Turku with 10.23.

Jacobs, who won 100m Olympic gold five years ago but was racing for the first time since the 2024 Games in Paris, came last with 10.44.

"It's the redemption from the [2024] European Championships where I finished behind Jacobs [who won gold]," said Glave, 25.

"This time I got the better of him. After the heats I felt a bit tight but I had enough time to go back to warm up and release it. 

"I was able to be patient compared to my last race, I just focused on the first 30m." 

Meanwhile, Britain's Morgan Lake won the women's high jump on countback ahead of Jamaica's Lamara Distin as they both managed 1.91m.

Slovenia's Kristjan Ceh secured a seventh successive victory of the season with gold in the discus, with the top three all surpassing 70 metres.

The 2022 world champion threw 70.61m to beat Australia's Olympic bronze medallist Matt Denny and Sweden's two-time world gold medallist Daniel Stahl.

Back on the track, USA's Dylan Beard won the 110m men's hurdles in a meeting record of 13.16.

Switzerland's world indoor silver medallist Ditaji Kambundji won the women's 100m hurdles final, clocking 12.66 to deny Pia Skrzyszowska by just 0.02.

New Zealand's Zoe Hobbs clocked 11.07 after an 11.09 heat to take 0.02 off the meeting record in the women's 100m and win by 0.04 ahead of Boglarka Takacs of Hungary.

Another meeting record fell in the men's 3,000m steeplechase as Germany's Frederik Ruppert continued his fine form to win in 8 minutes 10.39 seconds, finishing just over a second ahead of his compatriot Karl Bebendorf who ran a personal best of 8:11.52.

Experts revealed that This is just Spain's second appearance in the semi-final of a Women's Euros, while Germany are in the last four for an 11th time

It is not often that Germany are the underdogs, but they will be when they take on Spain for a place in the Euro 2025 final.

Spain have never reached the final of a Women's European Championship before, but the the 2023 World Cup winners have excelled throughout this tournament and are the only remaining unbeaten team in Switzerland.

Eight-time winners Germany, meanwhile, face potential issues with squad depth, suffered a big defeat in the group stage, and had to come from behind against France - down to 10 players for most of the game - to win on penalties.

But Spain, who beat Switzerland 2-0 in the last eight, have lost their past two meetings with Germany.

As their Euro 2025 semi-final approaches, BBC Sport analyses the key areas which could prove the difference and who is more likely to come out on top.

While Spain have played expansive, possession-based football throughout Euro 2025, it has been a different story for Germany.

Forced to be defensive against France after Kathrin Hendrich was sent off in the 13th minute, they finished their quarter-final having had just 25.6% possession.

Such a level was lower than usual for Germany, but even in games where the dynamics are different they have not focused as much on holding the ball.

Spain have averaged 73.5% possession, the most of any side at Euro 2025, while Germany have averaged 53.6%, the sixth-most.

Spain's passing accuracy - along with number of passes into the final third and total passes - are also the best of any team at the competition.

One average, they have created the third-highest number of big chances, while Germany are ranked 10th.

Germany manager Christian Wuck said his side "will suffer" and have limited possession on Wednesday, but they will work to "find the right moments". 

His side's best chance is to find ways to attack on the break, but they will probably have to endure lots of time without the ball.

"I think everyone knows the Spanish players," Wuck said. "They play the same sort of football, short passes. I think we will chase them a lot, we won't have a lot of possession and we will suffer but we have to find the right moments and to take advantage of the right moments to push our game."

Germany captain Giulia Gwinn has been ruled out of Euro 2025 with a medial ligament injury

Germany must recover from the physical demands of a quarter-final in which they were a player short for 107 minutes, and they must do so with fewer players available.

Hendrich is suspended following her red card, while Chelsea midfielder Sjoeke Nusken is banned after receiving two yellows.

And Germany are severely lacking in full-backs: Sarai Linder is out of the rest of the tournament with ankle ligament damage sustained against France and captain Giulia Gwinn has been sidelined since picking up an injury in their opening group game.

Fatigue may be an issue across the board for Germany, but they are boosted by Carlotta Wamser's return from suspension.

Spain have nearly all of their squad available, with only suspended defender Laia Aleixandri unable to take part on Wednesday.

Montse Tome's side also benefit from having had an extra day to rest and prepare.

Another key advantage for Spain will be their squad depth, with an ample number of high-quality players available to bring off the bench.

Such depth has proved important at Euro 2025, with Athenea del Castillo coming on and breaking the deadlock in their quarter-final victory over Switzerland.

But while Germany have not had as long to prepare, Tome believes they will "compete to the limit".

She said: "Germany are always good physically, they are a strong team, they are good in defence and attack. They are probably tired because they had a player less but these kinds of things are not something we can control."

Spain's Esther Gonzalez (left) is the top scorer at Euro 2025 with four goals

Spain have been rampant at Euro 2025. No team has scored as many goals, or produced as many expected goals.

They have been dominant in the final third in all of their fixtures, controlling the ball in the opposition's half and creating chances.

In total, they have scored 16 goals in four matches, beating Portugal 5-0 and Belgium 6-2.

Esther Gonzalez has netted four, making her the top scorer at Euro 2025, while Alexia Putellas has scored three and provided four assists.

They have had nine different scorers, while Germany's six goals have come from just three players.

Spain's dominance of the ball, combined with relentless pressing in the final third, suggests Germany can expect a test of endurance.

"We'll try to have the possession, but what may be different is how we will do it," Tome said. 

"Their defence is different; during the tournament, they've changed things. We see where they can leave spaces and from there we work out how we will attack those spaces.

"We need to have the ball and then with the space we will attack - but Spain need to have the ball."

While Spain have dominated in the opposing half, Germany have focused their efforts down the wings.

Jule Brand has scored two and assisted two of Germany's six goals, playing mainly out wide but also moving inside when needed.

Spain will aim to prevent Germany gaining possession in the middle of the pitch and  threatening down the flanks.

"We want to have control of the game," Spain midfielder Putellas said. "We understand this means keeping the ball most of the time."

Evidence from previous fixtures suggests Spain can control play down the centre.

But Germany will take hope from the way Switzerland caused Spain problems out wide in their quarter-final.

Reacting to that game, former England midfielder Izzy Christiansen said Spain will "know they have to improve".

She added: "You wonder if Spain had been playing a higher-level team, would they have put on a higher-level performance?

"They were forced into mistakes by the Switzerland shape and their attitude and body language wasn't great, and when you get into that state of mind you're not in control."

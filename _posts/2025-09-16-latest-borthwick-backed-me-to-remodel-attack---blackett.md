Let's dive into the details: Blackett (far right) took part in a three-day training camp with England this week and will officially start his new role at the end of the month

New assistant coach Lee Blackett says he had licence to remould England's attack during this summer's successful audition for a permanent role.

Bath attack coach Blackett was seconded to Steve Borthwick's side for two Tests against Argentina and a one-off match against the United States.

England, who were without 15 players who toured with the British and Irish Lions, won all three matches, scoring 13 tries in the process.

"Steve said from the outset that, while we obviously have to carry over some stuff, the attack must also be a true reflection of what Lee Blackett wants," Blackett told BBC's Rugby Union Weekly.

"I took a lot of confidence from that - he is backing you as a coach to come in and deliver and there is a reason why he wants you to join the environment."

Blackett will link up with England full-time at the end of September after the Rugby Football Union reached an agreement to buy out his contract at The Rec.

Under his guidance, Premiership champions Bath averaged more than five tries a game on their way to the top of last term's regular-season standings.

Blackett was previously director of rugby of a free-scoring Wasps side and did a one-season stint in the Scarlets backroom.

Last season he also took charge of England's A team for their wins over Australia and Ireland's second strings, something that he says helped him step up as several fringe players were similarly promoted in the absence of Lions stars.

Richard Wigglesworth, who previously coached England's attack, was also picked for the Lions staff, opening up a space.

"I probably got lucky with some situations," said Blackett.

"We went away in the summer and I loved every second of it. I came back and really knew I had to get my focus on going back into the Prem because I had got that international bug.

"I have always been really open with [Bath head coach] Johann [van Graan] from day one - I have always said that my dream for my next job would be go to international.

"It is something I always wanted to do and to do it with your own country - and to cheat by coming in halfway through a World Cup cycle - it was something I couldn't say no to."

In another reshuffle of England's coaching set-up Wigglesworth will now take charge of England's defence, with Joe El-Abd moving across to a more general, strategic role with the forwards.

"I have known Wiggy [Wigglesworth] for a long time," said Blackett, who played cricket and rugby against his new colleague when they were at school.

"We are pretty tight. He has spoken to me about his desire to coach defence and how that will improve his coaching.

"Wiggy is the alpha male isn't he? He suits defence, he is coming at you.

"I have seen him coach for the past two days and it doesn't matter what side of the ball he is on, he is a really good coach."

Blackett revealed that Bath head coach Johann van Graan - then a rival - had called him when Wasps went into liquidation in 2022 to offer his sympathies.

"He rang me that night," said Blackett.

"I remember what a great human being he was to do that. I hardly knew him. I had met him twice. But for him to take time out of his day to ring me... we went from there.

"Bath have an unbelievable group of lads, both staff and players. As a coach, good players make you look good. The sad part of leaving is the relationships that you have built."

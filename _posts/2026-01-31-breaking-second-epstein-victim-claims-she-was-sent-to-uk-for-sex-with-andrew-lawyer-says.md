According to new developments, A second woman is alleging that she was sent to the UK by Jeffrey Epstein for a sexual encounter with Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, her lawyer has told the BBC.

The encounter allegedly occurred at the former prince's residence, Royal Lodge, in 2010. The woman, who is not British, was in her 20s at the time.

The woman's lawyer, Brad Edwards from the US firm Edwards Henderson, said that after spending the night with Andrew, she says she was also given a tour of Buckingham Palace and tea.

"We're talking about at least one woman who was sent by Jeffrey Epstein over to Prince Andrew. And she even had, after a night with Prince Andrew, a tour of Buckingham Palace," the lawyer said.

BBC News has asked Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor for comment, but so far he has not responded to these accusations.

Buckingham Palace routinely records the names of tour guests but it has not been possible for the BBC to corroborate the woman's visit without revealing her identity.

The woman's account of spending the night at Andrew's home is the first time an Epstein survivor has alleged a sexual encounter occurred at a royal residence.

Edwards represents more than 200 Epstein survivors worldwide, and represented Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that she was brought to London to have sex with the former prince in 2001 when she was 17.

Giuffre said she was forced to have sex with Andrew two more times between 2001 and 2002 - once in New York and once on Epstein's private Caribbean island.

Epstein was convicted in 2008 of soliciting sex from a 14-year-old girl in Florida and completed his sentence in July 2010.

The lawyer, who is based in Florida, told the BBC that there were communications between his client and the former prince before the encounter where she says she spent the night with him.

Edwards said he had been in contact with "certain legal counsel" of the former prince in the United States, but said Andrew had "seemingly been disconnected from his lawyers".

Communications stopped after King Charles formally removed Andrew's "style, title and honours", he said. Andrew was stripped of his royal titles in October last year, following the publication of Giuffre's posthumous memoir. It was also announced that he would leave Royal Lodge on the Windsor estate, which had been his home since 2004.

In the statement announcing the removal of the former prince's titles, the Palace said: "These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him."

Edwards said that stripping Andrew of his titles has allowed the former prince to maintain that he has no money and no ability to provide compensation, and to "allow these women to just suffer".

"So the idea that the Royal Family so far cares about the victims, wanted to make things right - what they have done by simply stripping Prince Andrew of his titles and nothing more, has had the exact opposite effect of what they claim they are trying to do," he said. 

A BBC investigation in 2025 found that Epstein had trafficked a number of women into the UK through commercial flights and his private jets.

Buckingham Palace in October said "their majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been and will remain with the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse".

The lawyer said he is now considering filing a civil lawsuit on the woman's behalf against the former prince.

Virginia Giuffre filed a civil lawsuit in the US against Andrew in 2021, settling the case in February 2022 for an estimated £12m. She took her own life last year.

Andrew has always denied Giuffre's claims.

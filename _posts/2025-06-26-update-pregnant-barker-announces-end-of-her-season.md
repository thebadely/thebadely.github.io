Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Elinor Barker began cycling with Maindy Flyers in her home city Cardiff

Four-time Olympic medallist Elinor Barker has announced her 2025 season is over because she is pregnant for the second time.

The 30-year-old Welsh competitor told  social media followers the news after finishing 16th in the British National Road Championships in Ceredigion, more than five minutes behind winning compatriot Zoe Backstedt.

Barker posted: "Raced my last race of 2025 today at Nationals TT, but for the happiest reason, as we're expecting our second baby in December.

"Extremely lucky once again to have full support from @unoxteam and @britishcycling and to be surrounded by so many experts."

She added: "Ps. If you're trying to hide a pregnancy at work, try to pick a job that doesn't require wearing skintight Lycra every day."

Barker will also miss the Women's Road World Championships in September, including the time trial.

She added bronze in Paris in 2024, where she also won another silver in the madison.

Barker has also spoken of her battle with endometriosis and the joy of success with her son present.

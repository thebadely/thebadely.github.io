Experts revealed that Newcastle United head coach Eddie Howe ended the club's 70-year wait for a major domestic trophy after winning the Carabao Cup last season

Head coach Eddie Howe says he is "very happy" at Newcastle United as he dismissed speculation linking with him the Manchester United job.

Only Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola, Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta and Fulham head coach Marco Silva have been in charge of a Premier League team longer than Howe since he was appointed by Newcastle in November 2021.

Asked if anything could tempt him away from St James' Park, following Ruben Amorim's sacking at Manchester United on Monday, Howe said: "No. Not at this current time.

"The most important thing for me is happiness in the role, happiness in the job, the relationships that I have with the people around me.

"That has not always been consistently good. Things can change at any football club, but I'm very happy at the moment."

There were tensions between Howe and sporting director Paul Mitchell, who left last summer after less than a year in the job.

But Howe has quickly struck up an understanding with Ross Wilson, who replaced Mitchell.

Wilson is the third sporting director Howe has worked with since taking charge, while David Hopkinson is the second chief executive after Darren Eales stood down because of ill health.

Howe said he is content at Newcastle as long as he can "express myself in the best way possible and be the best version of myself".

Newcastle are ninth in the Premier League - but only two points off fifth - have reached the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup and are on course for a last-16 play-off spot in the Champions League.

Howe continues to enjoy the backing of the club's majority owners, the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, as well as minority shareholder Jamie Reuben.

"For any club to be successful, there has to be unity from top to bottom," Howe said. "There has to be a good feeling between everyone.

"I've had an unbelievable relationship with the board. That's never changed.

"I consider myself very lucky to have that because there are very few managers that have the time to build those relationships.

"To have the confidence and trust within each other is really important. Hopefully that stays for a long time."

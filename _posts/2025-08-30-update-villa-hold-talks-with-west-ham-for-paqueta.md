Let's dive into the details: Paqueta has scored 20 goals in 123 appearances for West Ham

Aston Villa have held talks with West Ham over a loan move with an obligation to buy midfielder Lucas Paqueta.

Sources have told BBC Sport that initial discussions have centred around a total package of around Â£50m including the loan fee before the deal is made permanent next summer.

Well-placed sources claim West Ham want to keep Paqueta and it remains to be seen whether the London club sanction the transfer.

But the 28-year-old is understood to be open to joining Villa before Monday's transfer deadline.

The Brazil attacking midfielder trained with his West Ham team-mates as normal on Saturday before their trip to Nottingham Forest on Sunday.

He was expected to make the trip for the match at the City Ground but his future at  London Stadium is now in question.

Tottenham and Everton also hold an interest in Paqueta.

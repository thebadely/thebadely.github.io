According to new developments, The former leader of Reform UK in Wales has been sentenced to 10-and-a-half years in prison after admitting taking bribes for pro-Russia interviews and speeches.

Nathan Gill, 52, from Llangefni, Anglesey, is thought to have received up to £40,000 to help pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine.

He was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) when he accepted money from Oleg Voloshyn, 44, a man once described by the US government as a "pawn" of Russian secret services.

At the Old Bailey, Judge Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said Gill had abused his position and eroded "public confidence in democracy".

Voloshyn was acting on behalf of a "close friend" of Vladimir Putin - Viktor Medvedchuk, 71, a former oligarch who was the source of the requests and the cash.

The Metropolitan Police said their own investigations are continuing into "whether any other individuals have committed offences". 

Gill is the first politician to be jailed under the Bribery Act.

Reform UK said it was glad justice was served, calling his actions "reprehensible, treasonous and unforgivable".

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer accused Gill of "undermining our interests as a country" and called on Reform leader Nigel Farage to investigate what other links the party had with Russia.

Cdr Dominic Murphy, head of the Met Police's counter-terrorism team, said Gill was an "extraordinarily willing participant" in the bribery, describing his actions as a "threat to national security".

He said the case formed part of a "breadth of activity" by Russia, including incidents such as the Salisbury poisonings in 2018 and an arson attack in London in 2024.

Gill, who was an MEP from 2014 to 2020 - initially for UKIP and then the Brexit Party - pleaded guilty to eight charges of bribery at an earlier hearing in March.

In return for money he gave two TV interviews to 112 Ukraine in support of Medvedchuk, a pro-Russian Ukrainian politician who faced treason proceedings at the time.

Medvedchuk was arrested by Ukrainian authorities at the start of the 2022 Russian full-scale invasion, and was later swapped with Moscow in a prisoner exchange.

Medvedchuk was connected to two TV channels - 112 and NewsOne - which in 2018 and 2019 were under threat of closure by the Ukrainian authorities.

Gill gave two speeches defending the channels in the European Parliament, both on request from Voloshyn, whose wife was a presenter on 112 Ukraine.

Both channels were eventually taken off air in 2021. 

Voloshyn also tasked Gill with finding other MEPs to speak to 112, and gave him talking points to pass on to them.

The court heard Gill mainly enlisted MEPs from the UK but also some from Germany and France.

Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb told the court there was no evidence they knew of Gill's financial motivation.

Police have said there was no evidence Gill was paying others.

In texts obtained by police, Voloshyn said he would "request and secure at least 5K" for Gill if he got "three or four" others on board.

Gill responded: "I shall do my best."

Gill also hosted Medvedchuk at the European Parliament's base in Strasbourg to promote a so-called "peace plan" for the Donbas region - an event that was praised by Vladimir Putin the following day on Russian TV.

Voloshyn asked Gill to arrange for colleagues from the Brexit Party to attend, the court heard.

Prosecution barrister Mark Heywood KC said Voloshyn asked Gill to book a room. Gill told them he could "drag a few in", promising a "small sack of paper gifts".

In one set of messages, Voloshyn offered to bring $13,000 USD (£9,936) to him, as well as €4,000 (£3,516) for the peace plan.

By December 2018, Mr Heywood said messages indicated there was already a "close relationship between the two men".

In her sentencing remarks, Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said there was "scant personal mitigation".

"The enlisting of fellow representatives into this activity compounds the wrongdoing, undermining the mutual trust essential to the proper functioning of democratic institutions," she said.

Police began investigating Gill after tip-offs from their intelligence sources – including the FBI, who found messages to Gill on Voloshyn's phone when he travelled to the US in 2021.

Officers were on the way to search Gill's house on Anglesey, north Wales, on 13 September 2021 when they learned he had already left for Manchester Airport, in order to fly to Russia to attend a conference and observe elections.

Gill was stopped and detained at the airport under counter-terrorism laws. His phone was searched and found to contain messages to Voloshyn.

Voloshyn used innuendoes to refer to money, on one occasion messaging Gill: "I've received all promised Xmas gifts and requested five more postcards for your kind help next week during the debate."

He provided scripts and instructions, directing Gill to speak up on behalf of 112 Ukraine and NewsOne.

"The budget and project is confirmed by V," he told Gill on 4 December 2018, referencing Viktor Medvedchuk, adding "V always delivers if he promises".

His message continued: "V was very excited when I told him of this option. And he really counts on it to happen."

Police searching Gill's house found €5,000 and $5,000 in cash. The court heard an application to recover £30,000 from Gill, but police think he could have made up to £40,000.

The earliest offence Gill pleaded guilty to dates to the same day he left UKIP in 2018.

He continued taking bribes after joining Nigel Farage's new Brexit Party. 

Later, he led the party into the 2021 Senedd election after it rebranded as Reform UK.

In mitigation, defence barrister Peter Wright told the court his actions may seem "unfathomable" given the "laudable and noble" features of his political life.

"He recognises, and did by his guilty pleas, the enormity of what he has done and the betrayal of the trust placed in him," Mr Wright said.

Farage has previously said he had no knowledge of Gill's "shameful activities" and condemned them "in every possible way".

Police said there was no link to Farage in their investigation.

Gill also represented North Wales in the Welsh Parliament from 2016 to 2017. Police found no evidence to suggest criminal activity linked to this period.

In addition to the eight charges to which he pleaded guilty, he pleaded not guilty to one charge, of conspiracy to commit bribery.

"Nathan Gill has absolutely been held to account for his activity," said Cdr Murphy.

"That should send a strong message to any elected official or anyone in an official capacity who is asked to act on behalf of another government and paid money to do so."

There were calls from the Liberal Democrats for a wider investigation into Russian influence in British politics from the Liberal Democrats.

Party leader Sir Ed Davey said: "A traitor was at the very top of Reform UK, aiding and abetting a foreign adversary."

Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts said if the former Reform UK leader in Wales was part of a "broader, coordinated effort to advance Moscow's agenda within our democratic institutions, then the public deserves to know the full truth".

Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Darren Millar said: "Reform is a threat to our national security."

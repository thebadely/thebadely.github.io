Here’s what you need to know: Martin O'Neill has won five of his six matches in interim charge of Celtic

It is exactly one month since majority shareholder Dermot Desmond asked Celtic legend Martin O'Neill to return to Parkhead in the wake of Brendan Rodgers' acrimonious resignation. 

The 73-year-old had been out of management for more than six years and walked into a club that was floundering on and off the pitch.

They were eight points behind Hearts at the top of the Scottish Premiership after a 3-1 reverse at Tynecastle and fan protests against the board were in full swing.

That off-field animosity remains, but O'Neill has steered Celtic through choppy waters on the park - even if one of those closest to him feared he would struggle to.

Thursday's 3-1 Europa League win at Feyenoord was Celtic's first away win in Europe since November 2021 and O'Neill's fifth win from six matches in charge.

Under his watch, they have moved within four points of Hearts with a game in hand and beat Rangers to reach the League Cup final next month.

"It's hard to say," O'Neill said, when asked what he thought when he took charge. "My two daughters were all for going for it, but my wife said I'd probably mess it up. 

"I haven't messed it up so far. It's been great. The results are what you live by and they've been terrific."

Goals from Yang Hyun-jun and Reo Hatate put Celtic in front after Ayase Ueda had given Feyenoord the lead, before Benjamin Nygren's late goal sealed a landmark victory.

It is Celtic's first win in the Netherlands since 2001, when O'Neill was first in charge and they knocked Ajax out of Champions League qualifying.

"We played really well," he said. "There was a period where we were dominant, controlling the ball and exuding a lot of confidence, which was lovely to see.

"Going a goal behind, we could have crumbled. But we showed character and resilience and then when we got the equaliser, the confidence flooded into the side.

"I said to the players 'you will get a chance to play tonight'. We took that chance."

Celtic play Roma and Utrecht at home, either side of a trip to Bologna, in their three remaining league-stage fixtures. They sit 21st in the 36-team table on seven points.

"Judging from last season, you are looking for 10 or 11 points to qualify," O'Neill added. "It won't be easy, but Celtic have two home games and the confidence is in the side now."

Columbus Crew head coach Wilfried Nancy appears close to being appointed as Rodgers' permanent successor and O'Neill thinks Celtic are well placed for the new man in charge, whoever it may be.

"He has got some players who are big winners," O'Neill said. "I'm sure he will lean on some of those lads and then it's about improving some of the other players.

"The restoration of confidence is big and it's keeping it going after that.

"Winning away from home is terrific - it's not easy away from home in Europe. It gives them belief that they can come and compete."

Celtic fans belted out O'Neill's name during the closing stages in Rotterdam, paying tribute to one of their favourite sons.

He won seven major honours during his first stint as manager and the way he has restored the club to winning ways during such a testing spell has only enhanced his reputation among the supporters.

"I told my two brothers who came to the game to start the chant, so they must have done so," O'Neill joked. "Might as well enjoy it while it lasts. 

"In the dressing room, the lads are full of it."

One of those full-of-it lads is Luke McCowan, who was tasked with a slightly unfamiliar role out wide in Rotterdam and credited O'Neill for giving Celtic the confidence to take the game to Feyenoord.

"His main message was that if we defend set-pieces well then our qualities will take over, and that was the confidence he gave us," the midfielder said. 

"He's amazing, an unbelievable character. He's able to take any heat off a serious situation and always pushes us.

"You can tell he's been a top manager here and that's why he's so respected. His best quality is man management - he's been class. 

"I'd love to have seen him 20 years younger when he probably had more energy and humour."

I can understand Celtic wanting to look to the future, but maybe the obvious solution is staring them in the face. 

With the group of players that was really struggling in the latter weeks and months of Rodgers' reign, O'Neill's got a big win on the road in Europe on the big stage. 

They don't do that very often. And he's done it on his second attempt.

It just shows you the magnetism of the man. Even though he's 73 and he hasn't done it for a number of years, he's still got it.

Craig: The O'Neill effect, great results under this temporary Manager. Wouldn't mind him staying.

Mark: Celtic's best result of the season and our best European result in years. Take a bow Martin O'Neill, what a legend.

Peter: Celtic should keep Martin on to advise the new manager. Wouldn't that be deserving for him and the club?

Kevin: Absolutely brilliant display. Martin O'Neill is the king of kings.

Dave: Great performance and great awareness from Martin O'Neill, he certainly knows what he is doing. Well done boys.

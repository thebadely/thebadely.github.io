Let's dive into the details: Arsenal's spending on player signings under manager Mikel Arteta is set to pass the Â£900m mark, should they sign Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze.

His arrival would take Arsenal's outlay this summer to Â£250m.

Arteta took charge of Arsenal in December 2019 and is the second-longest serving current manager in the Premier League and the third-longest serving across England's top four divisions.

The Gunners have posted second-place finishes in each of the past three seasons.

They have also reached the quarter-finals and semi-finals of the Champions League in the past two campaigns.

Arsenal's spending this season of just under Â£190m already includes the Â£55m initial fee paid for Swedish striker Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting

Arsenal's total spending this summer could rise towards Â£270m if all potential add-ons, including those for Eze, are triggered.

In each of Arteta's five full seasons prior to this one, Arsenal have spent more than Â£80m every time. That includes totals of Â£143m in the 2021-22 campaign, Â£159m in the 2022-23 term and Â£199.3m two seasons ago.

It is believed Arsenal's total spending is the fourth highest of all Premier League clubs since the start of the 2020-21 season, with only Chelsea, Manchester United and Manchester City above them.

Arsenal have room in their budget to bring in players, which is why they have been so aggressive in this transfer window.

They have signed six players for around Â£190m and are getting close to agreeing a deal for Eze worth around Â£60m.

The club's commercial business is strong and repeated Champions League football has helped their budgets, so they are clear with profit and sustainability rules (PSR) in the Premier League. Although Uefa's squad cost control can be more difficult to manage, there do not seem to be any immediate issues.

Initially, the club were looking to let players leave before adding another signing, but an injury to Kai Havertz has changed things.

Arsenal have players they would be open to selling to bring some cash back into the building, with Fabio Vieira, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Reiss Nelson, Jakob Kiwior and Albert Sambi Lokonga not in the matchday squad for the opening day of the season.

Player sales have been an issue for Arsenal. Their record departure remains the Â£35m received for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in 2017 when he joined Liverpool.

In the past five seasons and the current campaign, only twice have Arsenal posted total player sales above Â£50m. The other four seasons all ended with total player sales below Â£30m.

Despite this limited income from player departures, the club have made money in recent years thanks to their performances in the Premier League and Champions League.

Arsenal's turnover rose by almost Â£150m from the 2022-23 season to the 2023-24 campaign because of significant increases in matchday, broadcasting and commercial revenues.

The 2023-24 season brought an increase of over Â£70m in broadcast revenue alone, with the team having gone from the Europa League's round of 16 to the Champions League quarter-finals in those two accounting periods.

Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze would become Arsenal's seventh permanent senior signing, if the deal is complete

For the last three accounting periods in 2021-22, 2022-23 and 2023-24, Arsenal have posted losses of Â£45.5m, Â£52.1m and Â£17.7m.

That is a three-year loss of Â£115.3m.

The total is higher than the total Â£105m loss for a three-year period which is permitted by the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules (PSR).

Despite being Â£10.3m over the permitted loss total to comply with PSR rules, in reality, Arsenal are not really in any PSR trouble.

Clubs are permitted to claim parts of their losses in 'add backs'. These are costs that the Premier League and its clubs recognise to be in the general interest of the club and football.

This includes investment in infrastructure, community, women's football, youth development and the depreciation of tangible fixed assets.

Arsenal are preparing for a third consecutive Champions League campaign. For the 2024-25 accounting period, they can expect similar revenues to 2023-24 after reaching the Champions League semi-finals.

In 2024-25, they also had a net transfer spend of just under Â£10m following the sales of Emile Smith Rowe, Aaron Ramsdale and Eddie Nketiah.

Furthermore, the sales of Smith Rowe and Nketiah would both represent 'pure profit', further bolstering their position in terms of PSR.

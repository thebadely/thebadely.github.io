Here’s what you need to know: Forget Liverpool against Everton or Arsenal against Manchester City, the big fixture this weekend is Chris Sutton versus AI chatbot Copilot.

Sutton claimed on this week's Monday Night Club that he is "more intelligent than AI" and the stats do support him, at least when it comes to football scores anyway.

He is top of the BBC predictions league table (see bottom of page) so far, with three wins in the first four weeks - and he has beaten AI every time.

"I am 4-0 up on AI - I don't know if it feels pressure, but it should," Sutton said. "Also, why is it not going to the best source? That's me. if it wants to do better, maybe it should start copying me?"

AI, however, does not agree that Sutton has superior intelligence, and seems to suggest that it is a bit early for him to be celebrating.

When asked 'are you worried that Chris Sutton is cleverer than you?' Copilot replied "not in the slightest".

And when asked 'is Chris Sutton better at football predictions than you?', it also responded confidently.

"Over time, AI tends to improve as it absorbs more data and refines its models," Copilot said.

It added: "Short term: Sutton's instincts and experience can give him an edge, especially in unpredictable fixtures.

"Long term: AI may outperform with consistency and breadth, especially across hundreds of matches."

We will find out who is best, humans or machine, over the course of this season because Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games in 2025-26, taking on BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests as well as AI.

For week five, he takes on some famous fans of Liverpool and Everton, before the 247th Merseyside derby at Anfield on Saturday.

A new documentary, Dreaming of You: The Making of The Coral, follows the story of the Merseyside band. It is an immersive experience combining reconstruction, archive footage and animation, and is in UK cinemas now

From a Reds perspective, The Coral frontman James Skelly and Starsailor's James Walsh have had their say.

Giving the Toffees' point of view is Katherine Parlour of indie duo Picture Parlour.

The most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.

A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.

As part of their 25th anniversary celebrations, Starsailor are set to release their first official live album, Starsailor with Strings: Live from Liverpool', on 3 October

Skelly and Walsh are both enjoying the Reds' winning start to the season, even if their performances have not been too convincing.

"Half the team is new so it is obviously going to take a bit of time bedding in, but there is enough individual quality to get us through until we start fully ticking," Skelly told BBC Sport.

"I'm happy," added Walsh. "The performances haven't been amazing but they will come. 

"Ryan Gravenberch has been superb and having a player with his calmness and skill under pressure is really important when a team is not in full gear."

Parlour, meanwhile, feels Everton have a new talisman that has given their fans hope.

"I couldn't ask for much more from Jack Grealish right now after all his assists, but he is due his goal for us," she said.

"He looks so up for it and the fans are really feeling that electricity. I'm just buzzed to see what he brings to the derby."

Chris Sutton was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.

The AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this weekend's Premier League scores'.

Anfield, 12:30 BST

Everton have started the season well. Jack Grealish has given them that creative spark on the ball and Beto is a tireless runner up front.

On top of that, you know David Moyes will make them hard to break down, too.

Liverpool left it late again against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday and I do wonder how much that game will have taken out of them.

Still, they have plenty of options in their squad and, while they have not been at their best, they keep on finding a way to win. That's what I think will happen again here. 

Sutton's prediction: 2-0

James Skelly's prediction: It's always best to play Everton when they are a bit confident. When they are struggling, they batten down the hatches and go all 'Dogs of War'. When they fancy themselves, I feel like we will do them. 

I don't see 'Moysey' going toe-to-toe with us, because he's not stupid is he? But I still fancy us. 3-1

Katherine Parlour's prediction: I'm a Blue, what can I say? Also, after watching Everton Ladies win at Anfield last week, I'm full of hope. 

A bit of magic from Grealish will decide it, and a consistent, tight, defence will see us through. 1-2

James Walsh's prediction: Everton won't make it easy, but the quality of this Liverpool team will shine through. 

The key man is Virgil van Dijk. When he's on form and marshalling the defence, it breeds calmness throughout the team. 2-1

AI's prediction: 2-1

Amex Stadium, 15:00 BST

I was at Tottenham's Champions League win over Villarreal on Tuesday for Radio 5 Live, and they were a little bit flat - they only had one shot on target all night, and only scored thanks to an own goal.

Spurs have started the season in a similar way to Liverpool, in that they have not always played that well but most of the time they have still got a result - apart from their defeat by Bournemouth.

What they have in their favour is two incredible centre-halves, in Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven, who were both phenomenal against Villarreal - Thomas Frank just has to hope he can keep them fit.

Brighton are inconsistent but they are brave and they have some dangerous attacking players. They will take the game to Spurs, and my gut feeling is they will take the win, too.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Skelly's prediction: A few goals here. 2-2

Parlour's prediction: Brighton are decent at home 2-1

Walsh's prediction: I hope James Milner is on the scoresheet again. 2-2

AI's prediction: 1-2

Turf Moor, 15:00 BST

Burnley manager Scott Parker will be feeling really hard done by after their last-gasp defeat by Liverpool, which like their loss against Manchester United was down to a stoppage-time penalty.

We know the Clarets were excellent defensively in the Championship last season, and they have shown they are resolute in the Premier League too, but the question is whether they are going to carry a big enough attacking threat?

That's why I fancy Forest here. This is an important game for big Ange Postecoglou, too. Whenever his team loses, whoever it is, it seems to be greeted with more glee than when most other managers lose, which is such an idiotic view.

His Nottingham Forest side were 2-0 up and cruising in the Carabao Cup in midweek but then missed a few chances, let Swansea back in the game and ended up going out to an unbelievable 97th-minute goal.

Postecoglou made 10 changes for that tie, so he has rested a few for this game. I am backing them to bounce back with 'The Woodchopper', Chris Wood, bagging the winner on his return to his former club.

Sutton's prediction: 0-1

Skelly's prediction: We know all about Burnley after last week. Forest to win 1-0... hang on, Ange is in charge of Forest now isn't he? ... so Burnley will score. 1-1

Parlour's prediction: Forest will be too strong 0-2

Walsh's prediction: Parker has got Burnley well organised. Forest will come good but they are in a bit of turmoil and Ange will need time to address that. 1-0

AI's prediction: 2-0

London Stadium, 15:00 BST

I got in an argument with a couple of West Ham fans on 606 because they had left early during last weekend's defeat by Spurs.

It's their right, I get that, but if you are a proper fan, you don't leave early. I never did that as a kid when I used to support Nottingham Forest.

West Ham are at home again this week, but that is more likely to hinder them than help them - and how many times have we seen this movie with the Hammers now? 

The owners always take the brunt of the blame when things are going wrong but they spent over Â£120m on new players this summer, with a net spend of Â£70m, and the problem for boss Graham Potter is that there hasn't been any improvement from when he took over in January.

Crystal Palace are so well drilled that, even if they are without injured duo Ismaila Sarr and Adam Wharton, they should still do a job on them.

Sutton's prediction: 0-1

Skelly's prediction: West Ham are struggling. 1-2

Parlour's prediction: I am going with Palace. 1-3

Walsh's prediction: The pressure is mounting on West Ham but with it being a make or break game the crowd at the London Stadium should get behind the team and get them over the line. 2-1

AI's prediction: 1-2

Molineux, 15:00 BST

When I lost at predictions a few weeks running last season, I didn't get a call from the BBC offering me a new deal.

Yet that is what seems to be happening with Wolves boss Vitor Pereira, which is really odd. They have already lost their first four league games, and if he loses the next four they will be calling for his head.

Wolves might feel they deserved something from their defeat at Newcastle last time out, after starting that game quite well, but that is nothing to how devastated Leeds will feel after losing out to a last-gasp own goal at Fulham.

That left Leeds without a point or even a goal on the road, while Wolves are without a point at all, so something has to give here.

Wolves are without the injured Jorgen Strand Larsen up front, which is a blow, but I am still backing them to win this one - maybe a new contract for Pereira will mean a new dawn for his team?

Sutton's prediction: 1-0

Skelly's prediction: A first point for Wolves. 1-1

Parlour's prediction: Leeds will put up a good fight. 2-2

Walsh's prediction: Wolves have got something to prove. 1-0

AI's prediction: 3-2

Old Trafford, 17:30 BST

It was fascinating to hear Paul Scholes talk about Manchester United's midfield on the Monday Night Club, saying that the players are not good enough in that central area.

I backed Ruben Amorim last season when he stuck to his system, because he had not had the chance to bring his own players in. But he has had that chance now, and they still can't get results.

United are arguably the biggest club in the world with a wonderful history of winning things, especially in the Premier League. 

The onus on them is not just to win every week, but to do it in a certain way - with panache, playing great attacking football.

The system Amorim plays, in his 3-4-3 formation, is OK if you are winning or playing scintillating football but at the moment United are doing neither. They have had a fair bit of possession in some of their games, but what are they doing with it?

I really like Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, but eventually United will need to win games, to give their fans something to cling on to. 

As Scholes said, their ambition at the moment is just to get into the top half. I am sorry but Amorim needs to give their supporters a bit more than that.

Where United are fortunate is that they have had a week off since losing the derby, while Chelsea were beaten by Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Wednesday.

It is a massive plus for United that they don't have European football. You can't moan about having less games - that should give them the physical advantage here.

Even so, how can you put together a case for United winning this game? I just can't.

Chelsea are not the finished article either, but they are playing some good stuff. They have also got Cole Palmer firing again, and he will make the difference.

Sutton's prediction: 1-2

Skelly's prediction: Amorim is the new Andre Villas-Boas. He won't make it to Christmas. 1-3

Parlour's prediction: Chelsea are one of the best attacking sides in the league right now. 1-3

Walsh's prediction: United to show some fight. 1-1

AI's prediction: 1-2

Craven Cottage, 20:00 BST

I actually got a Fulham prediction right last week - I think it was for the first time ever.

This is a hard one to call, because Brentford are useful on the counter-attack under Keith Andrews.

But Fulham did the double over the Bees last season and, after successfully backing them to beat Leeds, I am going to stick with them.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Skelly's prediction: Fulham to take this. 2-0

Parlour's prediction: This is going to be tight. 1-1

Walsh's prediction: Home advantage should tell. 2-1

AI's prediction: 1-1

Vitality Stadium, 14:00 GMT

This is tough because you could make an argument for every outcome, but I am going to back Bournemouth.

I have been impressed by the Cherries so far, in defence and attack, and although Newcastle beat Wolves last time out, they have not really got going yet.

Former Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe is yet to win at Vitality Stadium in three visits with Newcastle, and he is going to have to wait a little longer for his first success.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Skelly's prediction: I can see Newcastle getting a point. 2-2

Parlour's prediction: Bournemouth are decent at home. 2-1

Walsh's prediction: Newcastle gave Liverpool a tough game and showed a lot of fight until young Rio Ngumoha popped up. They impressed me enough to think they will nick this. 1-3

AI's prediction: 1-1

Stadium of Light, 14:00 GMT

I haven't backed Sunderland to win yet this season, and a few of their fans have been hammering me on social media because they have made a really good start.

But I am not just going to back them to win for the sake of it, even against an Aston Villa side who are short of form and confidence, and cannot even score a goal at the moment either.

Instead I am going to say Villa will come good, and for Ollie Watkins to not just get their first goal of the season, but to secure their first win too.

Apologies again to Sunderland fans for that - they can hammer me again this week if I'm wrong.

Sutton's prediction: 0-2

Skelly's prediction: Villa to get a goal, at last. 1-1

Parlour's prediction: I have a good feeling about Sunderland this week. 1-0

Walsh's prediction: Sunderland seem to be enjoying life in the Premier League. 2-1

AI's prediction: 1-0

Emirates Stadium, 16:30 GMT

I am very sure about this one - Arsenal to win.

Manchester City played well in the derby, but they were up against a poor Manchester United team and Arsenal are on a different level. 

They will rough City up and I can see Erling Haaland being bullied out of it - I am not going to make him captain of my Fantasy team this week.

Sutton's prediction: 1-0

Skelly's prediction: Arsenal are our biggest rivals for the title - if we finish above them, we win it - but I fancy City here. Mikel Arteta is a bit too cagey in big games like this, and it is a case of 'who he dares'. 1-2

Parlour's prediction: A few goals in this one. 3-2

Walsh's prediction: City have an amazing keeper in Gianluigi Donnaruma now, so that will keep it low scoring. 1-1

AI's prediction: 3-2

Chris got eight correct results with no exact scores from the 10 games in week four, giving him 80 points.

That meant he beat his guest, Only The Poets frontman Tommy Longhurst, who got six correct results with no exact scores, giving him 60 points - the same total as the collective efforts of the BBC readers.

AI finished further back - it got five correct results with no exact scores for a total of 50 points.

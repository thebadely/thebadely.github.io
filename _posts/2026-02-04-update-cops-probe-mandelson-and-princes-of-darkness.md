Let's dive into the details: All of the papers lead on Lord Mandelson becoming the subject of a criminal investigation. The Times says he is expected to be interviewed under caution after being accused of passing market sensitive information to Jeffrey Epstein. The Daily Telegraph says the announcement means other senior figures from the New Labour era could also be questioned. The Guardian reports that detectives are also looking to request access to Lord Mandelson's devices. He has not responded to requests for comment about the allegations.

Most of the papers also reflect on Peter Mandelson stepping down from the Lords. "Good riddance" says the Daily Star.The i's political editor, Hugo Gye, writes that there's "no way back to public life" now for the former Labour minister. The Daily Mirror highlights that No 10 says its asked officials to draft legislation to "strip" the New Labour architect of his title, which he currently retains.

However, the Guardian argues that for Downing Street, Lord Mandelson risks "being a headache that simply will not end", as the focus shifts to how he was given the role of Britain's ambassador to the US last year. The Daily Telegraph says the issue is "threatening to undermine Sir Keir Starmer's leadership".

The Sun has more details on Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor moving out of Royal Lodge, after new revelations about his ties to Epstein. The paper says it happened under "the cover of darkness". He is also said to have been "booted out" earlier than planned. Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied any wrongdoing.

The Daily Express focuses on Prince Edward, the brother of Mountbatten-Windsor, urging people to "remember the victims" of Epstein. He made the comments at the World Governments Summit in Dubai, after being asked by a reporter how he was "coping" with the fallout from the files.

And finally, as filming gets under way for the Sir Sam Mendes Beatles movie, some of the papers carry photographs of London being made to look like New York, to recreate when the band appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964. The Daily Mail says "it would be easy to believe that Beatlemania was still alive and kicking".

According to new developments, Judd Trump has won 30 ranking event titles

World number one Judd Trump missed out on the Wuhan Open quarter-finals but teenager Stan Moody made the last eight for the first time on tour.

Trump, the 2023 champion at the event in China, was edged out 5-4 by fellow Englishman Gary Wilson.

Former world champion Trump made three 50-plus breaks but could never pull more than one frame ahead and Wilson took it to a decider, which he dominated to set up a meeting with Scotland's John Higgins, who was a 5-1 winner over Tom Ford.

Promising youngster Moody, 18, from Halifax, beat fellow Englishman Barry Hawkins 5-0, with a top break of 108, and said it was the best win of his career.

"I was in the zone. I don't know what happened really, I just potted everything," Moody, who is ranked 61st in the world, told the World Snooker website.

He will take on defending champion Xiao Guodong of China, who had a break of 136 on the way to beating Englishman Matthew Selt 5-2 in the last 16.

Mark Williams will meet Chinese player Zhang Anda in the last eight after winning a tussle between former world champions, with the 50-year-old Welshman beating Mark Selby 5-3 to reach the 118th ranking event quarter-final of his career.

Northern Ireland's Mark Allen swept to a 5-1 victory against fellow left-hander Thepchaiya Un-Nooh of Thailand. China's Si Jiahui awaits Allen next after a 5-2 victory over Scotland's Stephen Maguire.

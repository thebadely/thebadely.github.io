It has been recently reported that Reaction to the mistaken release of two inmates from Wandsworth Prison features on most of the front pages. "Not again" is the Daily Mirror's headline. "Shocking" says the Daily Express. The i Paper says Justice Secretary David Lammy is feeling the "heat". The Guardian says the episode has left him "under pressure" after he had brought in extra checks in response to the accidental release of a migrant sex offender from a prison in Essex last month.

According to the Times, Lammy had "rejected calls" to give a Commons statement on the matter, fearing it would be "career suicide" to do so. The paper notes that he later said he was "absolutely outraged" by the accidental releases, and the incident exposed "deeper flaws" in the prisons system.

Many of the papers carry photographs of the Democrat Zohran Mamdani, after his victory in New York's mayoral election. "Democratic cheer", says the Financial Times, adding that his win serves as a "resounding snub" to US President Donald Trump. The Daily Telegraph says pro-Trump insiders have warned the result - as well as other victories in the New Jersey and Virginia governor races - should "worry" the Republican Party ahead of next year's mid-term elections.

The Guardian reports that Lancashire's Reform-led council has been accused of "selling off the family silver" with its plans to save £4m a year by closing five care homes and five day centres it runs. The paper says residents would be moved into the private sector. Reform has said it needs to find cuts of more than £100m in Lancashire and the council's cabinet has agreed to adult social savings of about £50m over two years.

And the Times highlights the crowd-funding efforts of the French company Duralex, best known for its classic glass tumblers, as it faces bankruptcy. The firm raised €16million (£14m; $18m), thanks to thousands of well wishers. Bosses said after dealing with the uncertainty caused by rising energy costs and declining sales, they were delighted to see the French were "sick" of watching the decline of their manufacturing industries and had acted "to stop the massacre".

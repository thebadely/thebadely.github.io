Experts revealed that Diogo Jota's sons, along with other young family members, were mascots for the Premier League meeting between the Portugal forward's two former sides

Liverpool and Wolves paid tribute to Diogo Jota on an emotional day at Anfield as his two former sides met for the first time since his death.

The Portugal forward, 28, was killed in a car crash in Spain in July, alongside his 25-year-old brother Andre Silva.

Jota joined Liverpool in 2020 after three seasons with Wolves.

Dinis and Duarte, two of his three children, joined the matchday mascots on the pitch before their Premier League game on Saturday.

Jota's sons, along with other young family members, led the Liverpool team out of the tunnel, walking out ahead of captain Virgil van Dijk.

Jota's wife, Rute Cardoso, was also in attendance.

A banner which read 'Diogo Jota, forever in our hearts' was held aloft in the Kop stand before kick-off.

Chants of "Diogo, Diogo, Diogo" rang out from the Wolves fans in the away end before all of Anfield stood and applauded as Liverpool supporters sang in tribute to Jota in the 20th minute.

Dutch midfielder Ryan Gravenberch scored Liverpool's opener and dedicated it to Jota - recreating the shark-style celebration that the Portugal forward sometimes used.

On Friday, Wolves players and staff laid wreaths outside Anfield in memory of their former forward, who joined the club on an initial season-long loan deal from Atletico Madrid in 2017 and went on to score 44 goals in 131 appearances.

Jota scored 65 goals in 182 appearances for Liverpool, helping them win the FA Cup and EFL Cup in 2022 and the Premier League title last season.

The Merseyside club retired Jota's number 20 shirt following his death.

In his programme notes before Liverpool's final home fixture of 2025, head coach Arne Slot said he hopes the affection Jota is held in can bring his family "solace".

"Reflecting on everything that has happened over the last 12 months ignites a rollercoaster of emotions but it is normal at this time of year to look back to everything that has happened," said Slot.

"Doing so leads me to think especially of the family of Diogo Jota on what will be their first Christmas without him.

"It is not my place to tell them where they should look for comfort â if that is even possible â but I can only hope that the feeling of love and affection that Diogo still generates brings them some solace."

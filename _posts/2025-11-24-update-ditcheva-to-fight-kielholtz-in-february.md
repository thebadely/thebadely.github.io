It has been recently reported that Ditcheva has stopped 13 of her 15 opponents

Britain's Dakota Ditcheva will make her return from a hand injury when she faces Dutch flyweight Denise Kielholtz in Dubai on 7 February.

Ditcheva broke her hand during her win over Sumiko Inaba in July as the unbeaten 27-year-old won her 15th successive bout.

The fight against Inaba was Ditcheva's first since winning the PFL's 2024 flyweight tournament where she became the first British woman to become an MMA world champion.

She has stopped 13 of her 15 opponents, winning 12 of them by knockout, building a reputation as one of Britain's most exciting fighters.

In 36-year-old Kielholtz, Ditcheva is facing a former kickboxing world champion who has won eight of her 13 professional fights.

The bout forms part of the PFL's Road to Dubai event which is headlined by Russian Usman Nurmagomedov's lightweight title defence against Britain's Alfie Davis.

Like Ditcheva, Davis is a PFL tournament-winner with the 33-year-old triumphing in this year's lightweight bracket, before securing a title shot against Nurmagomedov.

The PFL's welterweight belt will also be on the line at the Coca-Cola Arena as Ramazan Kuramagomedov defends the belt against fellow Russian Shamil Musaev in the co-main event.

Laviai Nielsen The double Olympic medallist from 2024 - with bronze in the 4x400 relay and mixed relay - finished fourth in the 2024 World Indoors on Glasgow's Emirates Arena track and will be fancied in the women's 400m.

Alexander Doom The three-time World Indoor champion returns to Glasgow, where he captured his first global 400m title in 2024. He also won the World Indoor 4x400m title with Belgium and two European outdoor titles that year. 

Imani Lansiquot The two-time World and Olympic medallist in the 4x100m will hope to open her season in Glasgow with victory in a hotly contested 60m that has seven women who have run under 7.30 seconds.

Andrew Robertson The Manchester runner is looking to build on his fine 2025 indoor season, when he won his first major international medal with 60m bronze at the European Indoor Championships.

Guy Learmonth The Scot is chasing selection for his fourth Commonwealth Games - on home soil - and is racing in Glasgow after a lengthy gap. 

Shaikira King A European Junior finalist over 800m in 2025, exciting prospect King steps up to the senior ranks in a high-class women's 800m.

Alyson Bell The two-time European Under-23 champion in the 4x100m will be looking to repeat the double she managed last year over 60m and 200m at the inaugural EAP Glasgow event.

Adam Thomas The World Indoor finalist in 2022 has been Scotland's top 100m runner for close to a decade and is seeking to make his second Commonwealth Games team this summer.

Charlotte Henrich Another promising junior stepping up to the senior ranks, the 2025 European Junior champion will race in her favoured 400m this weekend.

Alessandro Schenini The Scot will look to defend the event he won in 2025, but will compete against several men who have recorded 7.90m and above in the long jump.

The EAP Glasgow will be live on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and on the European Athletics website for those outside the UK.

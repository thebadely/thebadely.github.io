According to new developments, Dani Dyer has withdrawn from this year's Strictly Come Dancing after breaking her ankle.

The TV personality, 29, said she "landed funny" in training on Friday, and had a fracture confirmed after a scan on Monday.

"To say I'm heartbroken is the biggest understatement," she said in a statement.

Her injury came after she took part in the pre-recorded launch show, which was broadcast on Saturday, but before the first competitive week of the series.

Dyer, who first found fame on Love Island, was paired with professional dancer Nikita Kuzmin on the launch show.

She said: "I had a fall on Friday in rehearsals and landed funny. 

"I thought I had rolled my foot but it swelled up badly over the weekend and after an MRI scan yesterday, it turns out I have fractured my ankle.

"Apparently doing the quickstep on a fracture is not advisable (!!) and the doctors have said I am not allowed to dance so l've had to pull out of the show."

She added: "I am so going to miss dancing with Nikita but will of course be watching closely and cheering all the couples on."

Dyer also posted a tearful video on Instagram, in which she said she was "heartbroken" and "absolutely gutted" at having to leave the show.

"I was having the best time ever. 

"It's a very, very annoying, devastating thing that I'm going through right now," she said, adding that she was going to take some time off social media. 

The show's executive producer Sarah James said Dani and Nikita's partnership had got off "to the most sensational start", and "everyone on the show is incredibly sad that she's no longer able to compete in this year's series".

"We send her all our love and best wishes for a swift recovery, and we very much hope to welcome her back to the ballroom in the future."

Judge Shirley Ballas was among those sending well wishes on Instagram. "I'm so so sorry. But health is most important. Get well soon Angel," she said.

Dancer Dianne Buswell wrote: "I'm so sorry Dani and Nikita. We will miss you so much xx."

Fellow professional Johannes Radebe said: "Gutted for you both, take care of yourself."

Dyer is the second celebrity to withdraw before the contest has even begun, following Game of Thrones actor Kristian Nairn.

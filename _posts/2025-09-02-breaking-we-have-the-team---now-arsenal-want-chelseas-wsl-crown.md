Experts revealed that Steph Catley is nominated for the Ballon d'Or after a strong 2024-25 campaign

Arsenal defender Steph Catley says there can be "no excuses" if the Champions League winners fail to challenge Chelsea for the Women's Super League title this season.

Chelsea's stranglehold has resulted in them winning six successive league titles.

The last time once-dominant Arsenal won the WSL was in 2019.

Despite being the only English team to win the Women's Champions League - doing so twice - they have fallen behind domestically in recent seasons.

Now, inspired by winning the European crown in May, Catley says the Gunners can catch up their London rivals in the WSL.

"As soon as you win something as big as [the Champions League], there is a target on your back," Catley told BBC Radio 5 Live's Women's Football Weekly podcast.

"There is an expectation that you should go on and do amazing things. Domestically, we haven't won nearly as much as we probably could have and we probably should have.

"There's really no excuses. We have the team. We have everything in place. It's about putting it together on the field and matching up to those expectations."

Catley identifies consistency as the key to success, and it is something Arsenal were building last term. A poor start to the season resulted in the departure of manager Jonas Eidevall, with Renee Slegers named as interim head coach.

Slegers enjoyed huge success and was appointed on a permanent basis before the team sealed European glory by beating Barcelona in Lisbon.

Catley says the Arsenal squad have been "working deeply" with Slegers this summer to understand what makes them tick.

"Our goal is to be consistent from round one and then maintain that. Domestically, you can't afford [to dip in form]," added Catley.

"Chelsea have made a habit of being able to win when they are maybe not playing their best football and I think that's something we could learn from them.

"Our football looks wonderful most of the time, but is it getting us wins consistently? It probably hasn't in the past."

The summer has brought great success for several members of the Arsenal squad, including the Lionesses who defended their title at Euro 2025.

England winger Beth Mead says the success with club and country will enable the players to grow.

"Getting that experience, and understanding what it takes for this team to do well, is important. Now we have to do it domestically," said Mead.

"We want to win every trophy, of course we do. That has to be the aim for an Arsenal team. We have to stop doing the talking and put it out on the pitch weekly."

England striker Alessia Russo, who shared the WSL Golden Boot with Manchester City's Khadija Shaw last season after scoring 12 goals each, says the squad have been "spurred on" by their Champions League success.

"Winning the Champions League was something I dreamed of as a kid. When you win a trophy, you get a craving for more," said Russo.

"We're all really motivated to go on and start the season strongly. For sure [the stakes are higher] and I hope the fans expect that because we expect that.

"We have such a talented squad. We know we've not competed as we want to in the league and the cups and we want to put that right this season."

Arsenal finished 12 points behind unbeaten WSL champions Chelsea last season

Arsenal have strengthened in the transfer window, breaking the British record as they made Canada forward Olivia Smith the first Â£1m player in the women's game.

They have also signed England international Chloe Kelly on a permanent deal and brought in former Liverpool vice-captain Taylor Hinds in defence.

Mead will be competing for a place in the starting XI with Kelly and Smith.

"It's a fresh season, a fresh chapter and we have some very good players within the squad and within the positions I play," said Mead.

"I'm here to compete. I play my best football when I have the chance to compete. We will make each other better as players.

"In the past, when Tobin Heath and Nikita Parris signed in the same season, it was another time when you had to kick into gear.

"Renee [Slegers] hopefully has a lot of headaches and decisions to make."

Another boost for Arsenal this season is the confirmation that Emirates Stadium will be their home for every WSL match, as well as European games.

Arsenal start at home to promoted and ambitious London City Lionesses on Saturday, with the newcomers out to cause an opening weekend sensation and Arsenal eager to make their own statement in the impressive arena.

"It just gives you a buzz. The amount of people we get there - our supporters are top-tier. We are so lucky to have them. You get used to that," said Catley.

"It will be a massive advantage to us. It's like a fortress and nobody wants to come and play there. It's not nice for them.

"The pitch is wonderful for us to play good football. There is no excuses."

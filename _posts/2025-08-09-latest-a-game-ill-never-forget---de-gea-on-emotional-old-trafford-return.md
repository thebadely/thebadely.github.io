According to new developments, David de Gea was playing at Old Trafford for the first time since leaving Manchester United

There was something fitting about Altay Bayindir saving the penalty that earned Manchester United victory in their final pre-season friendly with Fiorentina.

This, after all, was the day David de Gea returned to Old Trafford.

It is two summers since De Gea was unceremoniously dumped by United after 545 appearances - putting him seventh on the club's all-time list - as then-manager Erik ten Hag opted to pay Â£47.2m to Inter Milan for Andre Onana.

De Gea said at the time he wondered whether he should pack in football altogether. He didn't - but the debate about the wisdom of his exit continues.

Many question whether Onana was worth it.

A direct comparison on this occasion was impossible. Onana was not involved as he continues his recovery from the hamstring injury that makes him a major doubt for next weekend's opening Premier League game against Arsenal.

If the Cameroon international is not fit, Bayindir will step in.

The Turkey international was expected to leave United this summer after losing out to Onana in the quest to feature in what turned out to be a Europa League final defeat by Tottenham.

But suitors for Bayindir have not been plentiful. 

It will, at least, have done the 27-year-old's confidence some good to have turned away Fabiano Parisi's spot-kick - the only time either goalkeeper touched any of the 10 penalties - in a 5-4 shootout victory that followed Saturday's 1-1 draw.

De Gea had gone off by then, replaced before the final whistle. He was given a standing ovation, echoing the reception he got when he came out for the warm-up and again at the start of the game, by an Old Trafford crowd in excess of 60,000.

It was the chance to say goodbye he had not been afforded in 2023.

"It's a game I'll never forget, for sure," said the 34-year-old.

"Sometimes it's difficult to describe with words how you feel on the pitch, seeing the crowd, with everybody there. It was so emotional for me."

De Gea was complimentary about his old club, saying "you can't control everything" about the manner of his departure.

There was unhappiness, though. The perceived wisdom is merely that De Gea's kicking ability was not at the standard Ten Hag required.

Yet, in a similar situation two years ago, Onana played the ball out from the back in a pre-season match against Lens, only for Diogo Dalot to immediately give the ball away.

Onana was out of his box as the ball sailed over his head and into the net from about 50 yards.

Kicking the ball is just part of a goalkeeper's armoury. De Gea's former United team-mate Nemanja Matic offered his own insight into the depth of feeling the former Spain international's departure caused, before a European game against Lyon in April.

"If you are one of the worst goalkeepers in Manchester United's history, you need to take care what you're talking about," said Matic, in response to Onana's claim they "should" beat Lyon, which they did - but only after a stunning extra-time comeback.

"If it was [Edwin] Van der Sar, [Peter] Schmeichel or [David] De Gea saying that, then I would question myself. But you need to have cover to say something like that."

On Saturday, De Gea just enjoyed being back in Manchester. There was one loose kick straight out of play and he was sent tumbling by a collision involving his own player in the build-up to United's equaliser, which went down as a Robin Gosen's own goal.

But he made some excellent saves, including a reaction to deny Leny Yoro that had the young Frenchman punching the ground in frustration.

Bayindir made some too - the best to deny former Everton forward Moise Kean, even if an offside flag he was not aware of was raised.

Few would argue Bayindir would be an upgrade on De Gea, but that is not really the point.

It has been claimed privately that once De Gea knew which way the wind was blowing on his United career, his performances dipped.

Yet, given the choice, many United fans would prefer to have De Gea in goal against Arsenal ahead of Onana.

It won't happen, of course. The respective paths have gone in different directions.

Now De Gea can only look on from afar in the knowledge that since his last appearance (the 2023 FA Cup final defeat by Manchester City), his old club have gained revenge for that loss, but also finished eighth and 15th - unimaginable for three decades.

De Gea met Sir Alex Ferguson, who brought him to United from Atletico Madrid in 2011, on Friday afternoon.

His respect for the Scot is huge.

"He's the boss, the reason I came to United," he said.

As for his old club, like many, he can only hope for better.

"I know it's been some years that United struggle a bit but it's one of the best clubs in the world.

"It's a massive club and hopefully this year with the new signings and the manager starting a new era they can do something big. Hopefully, this year they can be where they deserve."

Experts revealed that Newcastle have been awarded three penalties in the Premier League this season

Newcastle United are "seeking clarification" from Professional Game Match Officials Limited over a penalty appeal that was turned down against Chelsea.

Head coach Eddie Howe said Newcastle were refused a "stonewall" penalty in Saturday's 2-2 Premier League draw at St James' Park after Chelsea defender Trevoh Chalobah barged Anthony Gordon to the ground.

The video assistant referee (VAR) upheld referee Andy Madley's on-field decision not to award a spot-kick.

The Premier League Match Centre said Chalobah was "deemed to be side-to-side in a shielding action and the ball within playing distance".

Howe said: "A call has already gone in. We just want to know the thought process behind the decision."

The PGMOL, the body responsible for refereeing all Premier League matches, has been approached for comment.

Newcastle were 2-1 up at the time, but Chelsea forward Joao Pedro equalised midway through the second half after a slip by Malick Thiaw.

No team have thrown away more points - 13 - from winning positions in the Premier League this season than Newcastle.

They are 11th in the table, have won only once away from home and travel to Manchester United on 26 December.

"My glass is very much half full," said Howe. "I know everyone else might have a different opinion, but I feel we're improving.

"We have been moving in the right direction, but we have got lots of work to do to be the team that we ultimately want to be and that's consistently winning. 

"That's what's eluded us this season - the ability to put winning runs together, which is the defining thing we need to do."

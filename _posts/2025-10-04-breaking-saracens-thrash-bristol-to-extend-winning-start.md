Saracens overpowered Bristol Bears 50-17 to go top of the early-season Prem table with their second win of the campaign.

The hosts raced into a 24-0 lead after just 21 minutes through converted scores from Theo Dan, Nick Isiekwe and Max Malins and Owen Farrell's penalty.

Nick Tompkins clinched a try bonus point and a 31-0 half-time lead before the Bears responded with the try of the game from Kieran Marmion.

Saracens' Jack Bracken crossed twice on his Prem debut, while Marmion crossed twice more for a second-half hat-trick before Hugh Tizard brought up Sarries' half-century late on.

Bears head coach Pat Lam said his side faced an uphill task to repeat last season's semi-final appearance after losing key winger Gabriel Ibitoye, England scrum-half Harry Randall and fly-half AJ MacGinty to long-term injuries in their opening day win over Leicester.

And centre Joe Jenkins, MacGinty's replacement Tom Jordan and winger Louis Rees-Zammit added to the mounting injury list in round two, while even referee Christophe Ridley was forced off in the first half after tripping over Saracens' Tom Willis.

Bristol were shown no mercy as an explosive start saw Sarries go 14-0 up inside seven minutes.

Dan crashed through Kieran Marmion's challenge to score in the left corner, before Rotimi Segun's break allowed Isiekwe to power over from close range.

Malins marked his return to the StoneX by creating and scoring the third try against his former side, making a break and then swapping passes with Ivan van Zyl before applying a swan dive finish.

Sarries also showed their steel, twice forcing turnovers on their own line to repel sustained Bristol pressure.

And with Viliame Mata in the bin for a high shoulder, Tompkins spun off a driving maul for his third Prem try of the season to cap a dominant first half.

Fly-half Owen Farrell booted 15 points and had a try assist in his second Prem game back for Saracens

Needing a reaction, Bristol responded within three minutes of the restart as Rees-Zammit's burst to halfway was taken on by Joe Owen whose one-handed offload sent Marmion in.

Farrell quickly restored order with a long cut-out pass for Jack Bracken - son of England World Cup-winning scrum-half Kyran - to finish well on his Prem debut before the 19-year-old poached a quickfire second.

Bracken's brother Charlie produced a super try-saving tackle, but more electric acceleration from Rees-Zammit teed up Marmion's second as Bears continued to cut loose.

Marmion went over from close range to complete a 31-minute hat-trick, but Tizard's powerful late finish underlined a ruthless display for the six-time Premiership champions.

And Bristol's day was summed up when Harry Thacker's dive for a last-gasp try bonus point fell short.

Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall on number eight Tom Willis' impact: 

"Tom was always very clear on what he needed to improve in his game.

"He was always a great carrier but now he's coming up with big moments in matches. The opposition will be attacking and suddenly he will appear with the ball. His defensive work has really come on over the past 12-18 months.

"Becoming the England number eight and some of the chats he has had with Steve Borthwick have given him added confidence."

Bristol Bears head coach Pat Lam told BBC Radio Bristol:

"Within four minutes we conceded three penalties, they rode on the back of that, we lost collisions in that space and for 20 to 25 minutes they blew us away.

"We hung in there and the goal was just to try and get a bonus point and we thought we had it at the end, but didn't get it.

"If you do the things that we train for and work together we score and we stop them, but there were times today when we didn't do that and that took the pressure off."

On the injuries to Joe Jenkins, Louis Rees-Zammit and Tom Jordan: 

"Joe Jenkins got caught in a really tough position in the breakdown so it looks like a hamstring, Zammit did his toe and Tom at half-time had taken a knock to his ribs and was still feeling it so we took him off as a precaution.

"Jordan and Zammit hopefully back next week, but Jenkins doesn't look great."

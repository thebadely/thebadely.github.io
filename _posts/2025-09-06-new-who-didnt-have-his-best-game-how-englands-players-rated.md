Experts revealed that England celebrate the opening goal against Andorra

England continued their 100% record in World Cup 2026 qualifying with victory over Andorra on Saturday - but did anyone impress?

BBC Sport football news reporter Alex Howell assesses how the players performed at Villa Park on Saturday - and you can see how BBC Sport readers rated them at the bottom of the page too.

Jordan Pickford: A very quiet game for the England goalkeeper. No saves to make and just passed the ball to the players in front of him to get the attacks started. 6

Reece James: A big favourite of Tuchel and seems to have the right-back position secured. Showed his quality on the ball and assisted Declan Rice for the second goal with an excellent cross. 7

Marc Guehi: He was named as the right-sided centre-back, a position that is unfamiliar to him as he usually plays the left-sided role. He was solid as expected, filling in with John Stones absent through injury. If those two are fit, they should be the starting centre-backs for England at the World Cup. 6

Dan Burn: Not tested defensively and given the task of driving forward with the ball. Dominant in the air but there was not much else for him to do. 6

Myles Lewis-Skelly: Like the rest of the back four, Lewis-Skelly did not have any serious defensive work. He played in a more traditional left-back role to create width rather than inverting into midfield like we see him do for Arsenal. 6

Elliot Anderson: A really solid debut for the Nottingham Forest midfielder. Comfortable taking the ball in possession and marshalling the space in front of the England back four. Looked like he had been playing that role for his country for a long time. Had a big chance to score but didn't connect with his shot. Not really tested defensively but a very good start to international football. 7.5

Declan Rice: Continued to play in the number eight role which he has at Arsenal as Thomas Tuchel looks to make the most of his running power. Scored the second goal with a good header before being replaced. 7

Eberechi Eze: A chance for Eze to impress in the number 10 role with so many other options out injured. Had one half chance in the first half and a good one in the second half that he didn't take. He played a key pass leading to the opening goal but it was congested in the middle of the pitch. Didn't have his best game. 6

Marcus Rashford: Made a positive start, beating two players with great pieces of skill. Had a big chance to score after picking up a rebound from Eze's shot but fired wide. Substituted in second half. 6

Noni Madueke: Like Rashford on the other wing, Madueke looked to take his man on at every opportunity. Drew an early yellow card in another positive appearance in an England shirt. It was his cross that was headed into the Andorra net for the opening goal. 7

Harry Kane: Chances were in short supply around a crowded penalty area. England's record scorer did not drop into deep positions as often as we are used to seeing. Had a chance to set up Anderson but the pass was slightly behind his new colleague. Almost got on the end of a dangerous James cross in the first half. 6

Tino Livramento: Came on in the 68th minute once the game was won at 2-0. Always looking to use his powerful running to make something happen. 6

Anthony Gordon: Replaced Rashford but did not many opportunities to have an impact. 5

Morgan Rogers: Brought on to play behind Kane in an advanced midfield role. Back at his home club, but like Gordon struggled to get involved. 6

Ezri Konsa: Brought on to replace Guehi but not tested. 6

Morgan Gibbs-White: Just over 10 minutes for Gibbs-White, but the game was already won. 6

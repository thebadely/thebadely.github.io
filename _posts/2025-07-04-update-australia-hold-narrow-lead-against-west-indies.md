Scorecard

Australia's lost both openers before the close as they finished 12-2 against West Indies on day two of the second Test, having bowled their opponents out for 253.

Jayden Seales broke the stumps of Sam Konstas for a four-ball duck then trapped Usman Khawaja lbw for two, with Australia taking a 45-run lead into day three.

John Campbell added 40 and Brandon King top-scored for the West Indies with 75, while a 51-run partnership between bowlers Alzarri Joseph and Shamar Joseph ensured the home side would come close to parity with Australia's first innings 286.

Nathan Lyon took the wickets of both King and Alzarri Joseph on the way to 3-75, while Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins took two wickets apiece as the game accelerated towards a swift finish.

Australia won the first Test in Barbados by 159 runs on day three, in a game where neither team passed 200 in the first three innings, and this match also looks set to be heading to an early conclusion as batters on both teams continue to struggle.

Teenage opener Konstas has now failed to make it into double figures in three of his four outings in the series, and veteran partner Khawaja hasn't passed 20 in three innings.

Jayden Seales, who took six wickets in the first Test and one in the first innings in Grenada, blew away the two openers inside three overs as Australia failed to navigate a short spell prior to close of play.

The West Indies have a struggling opener of their own, with former captain Kraigg Brathwaite, who made four in both innings in Barbados, caught and bowled by Hazlewood in the second over of the day.

Keacy Carty was then removed for six by Cummins with the same method of dismissal, but King warded off a collapse, adding steady runs alongside Campbell, Roston Chase and Shai Hope.

Having made his maiden Test half-century in his second game in the format, he was dismissed between Chase and Justin Greaves in a flurry of wickets that left West Indies at 174-7 and at risk of a significant first innings deficit.

But the two Josephs frustrated the Australian bowlers with their stand for the eighth wicket, before Seales caused chaos in the final overs of the evening session.

Let's dive into the details: The Sun on Sunday says it has obtained an email from the Duke of York to Jeffrey Epstein in which Prince Andrew tells the disgraced financier "we are in this together". It says the message was sent in February 2011, the day after a photo emerged showing the prince with Virginia Giuffre - and weeks after he later claimed to have cut ties with Epstein. The Mail on Sunday, which has also seen the email, calls it "astonishing" and a "bombshell", and says it proves Prince Andrew lied to the BBC's Newsnight programme. Both papers say he has declined to comment.

Several papers examine the mood in Israel and Gaza with the ceasefire now in force. The Sunday Times says that, "for the first time in two long years, the night air in Tel Aviv carried not the sounds of sirens, but the pulse of anticipation". It says the square where hostage families gather has turned from a place of anguish to one of cautious celebration. The Observer hears from a student in central Gaza, shocked by the sense she had managed to live through a war. "It was a mix of happiness and disbelief", she says.

The Sunday Telegraph says the Chancellor will "tax the rich" in the Budget, rather than cutting spending or increasing borrowing. Sources tell the paper that Rachel Reeves will be "fair" when she asks people to contribute more, but says those on "higher incomes" will be targeted. The Sunday Express thinks she is "eyeing up" a raid on pensions, either pushing up taxes on contributions by working people, or on withdrawals by those who have retired. The Sunday Mirror says Reeves is pledging to "leave no stone unturned" in her efforts to get the economy firing again.

The Sunday Times says the White House is the latest to express concern about the collapse of the case against two men accused of spying for China. It says the government has been told it could undermine the special relationship, and could threaten intelligence-sharing between the UK and the US. The Sun on Sunday says the longer the row goes on - about whether the government played a role in the spying case being dropped - the more concerning the situation becomes.

It has been recently reported that Oasis guitarist and co-founder Paul 'Bonehead' Arthurs has had to pull out of the band's comeback tour after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. 

He said he would take a planned break to miss gigs in Seoul, Tokyo, Melbourne and Sydney for treatment. 

In a post on Instagram he said he had been diagnosed earlier this year, but had been able to be "part of this incredible tour" after responding "really well" to treatment.

"I'm really sad to be missing these shows, but I'm feeling good and will be back ready to go in time for South America," the 60-year-old added. 

Arthurs previously recovered from tonsil cancer in 2022. 

In his post, he told fans: "Have an amazing time if you're going this month, and I'll see you back onstage with the band in November. Bonehead X."

He plays rhythm guitar and keyboards with the Manchester band, which he once left in 1999 before returning for the Gallagher's recent reunion.

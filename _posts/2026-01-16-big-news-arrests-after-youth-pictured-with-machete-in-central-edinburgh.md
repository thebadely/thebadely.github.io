Experts revealed that Two teenage boys have been arrested after police received reports of people carrying bladed weapons in Edinburgh city centre.

A photo taken in Rose Street showed a young man walking with what appeared to be  large machete in his hand, just a short distance from other pedestrians. 

Police - including specialist firearms officers - were called to the street at about 14:55 on Friday and two male youths, aged 17 and 15, were arrested. 

No one was reported to have been injured and Police Scotland said enquiries were ongoing

According to new developments, Wales have won eight of their 16 matches under Craig Bellamy

Wales' focus lies on Thursday's World Cup play-off draw as they wait to discover their semi-final and potential final opponents.

Having finished second in their qualifying group courtesy of an emphatic 7-1 triumph over North Macedonia - their biggest win since 1978 - Craig Bellamy's side will play the last-four encounter on home soil.

They will face either Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo or Republic of Ireland in that fixture on 26 March.

Former Wales striker Rob Earnshaw believes the Dragons will relish a tie against any opponent on the back of their most recent result at Cardiff City Stadium.

"I know Craig Bellamy, I played with him and his mentality is 'give us whoever, it doesn't matter'," Earnshaw told BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast.

"A lot of people were saying last night, 'do we really want Republic of Ireland as it's that derby feel?'. I think a lot of people didn't. But for me, that would be incredible.

"So it's one of those, yes, we'll take Kosovo or Bosnia and Albania are not bad and the Republic of Ireland, of course, they're a very good team so they'll be difficult.

"But you just feel that we'll take anybody right now and it doesn't matter, and a lot of that is down to Craig Bellamy."

Highlights: Wales 7-1 North Macedonia

Wales sit 32nd in the Fifa world rankings, with Republic of Ireland 59th, Albania 63rd, Bosnia-Herzegovina 71st and Kosovo 80th.

Albania enjoyed a strong qualifying campaign, with their only defeats coming at the hands of Group K winners England, who claimed maximum points without conceding a single goal.

Burnley's Armando Broja and Lazio's Elseid Hysaj are among the Red and Blacks' more notable names, although it was former Inter Milan, Barcelona and Watford forward Rey Manaj who topped their scoring chart in qualifying with three goals.

It is worth noting that Albania have never qualified for a World Cup, although they featured at Euro 2016 and Euro 2024, failing to reach the knockout stages on both occasions.

As Slovenia and Sweden endured torrid campaigns, with both failing to win a qualifying match, Group B was a straight shootout between Switzerland and Kosovo.

The Swiss ended the six-game campaign three points clear of Kosovo, whose one defeat came at the hands of the group winners.

Kosovo include former Manchester City goalkeeper Arijanet Muric and Mallorca's Vedat Muriqi - his nation's all-time top scorer - in a squad targeting a first major tournament appearance.

They have never faced Wales.

Bosnia-Herzegovina lost just once in qualifying, and claimed a point more than Wales managed in their eight games, but still finished two points adrift of Group H winners Austria.

They were 13 minutes away from clinching a spot at the World Cup, but Michael Gregoritsch's equaliser for the Austrians ensured the pair drew in the final game of qualifying and Ralf Rangnick's team topped the group.

Wales have failed to beat the Bosnians in four attempts but did have a memorable defeat against Zmajevi - the Dragons - as they qualified for Euro 2016 under Chris Coleman despite losing.

As his country's all-time top goalscorer and most-capped player, former Manchester City forward Edin Dzeko, now at Fiorentina, is unquestionably Bosnia-Herzegovina's standout player. 

The 39-year-old was his team's top scorer in qualifying with five goals.

And finally, we have Republic of Ireland.

Having taken just one point from their opening three qualifiers, Heimir HallgrÃ­msson's side surged into the play-offs with successive wins against Armenia, Portugal and Hungary.

Troy Parrott netted both goals against Euro 2016 winners Portugal before bagging a hat-trick - with the third goal coming in the 96th minute - as the Irish stunned Hungary to take second spot in Group F in dramatic fashion.

Talisman Seamus Coleman played a vital role in his side's resurgence while Brentford goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher has made the number one jersey his own.

The Republic of Ireland are winless in their past four meetings with Wales, losing three of those, although James McClean broke the hearts of the Red Wall as Martin O'Neill's men won a crucial World Cup qualifier at Cardiff City Stadium in 2017.

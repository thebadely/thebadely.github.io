It has been recently reported that Wales number eight Aaron Wainwright has played in two World Cups

Autumn Nations Series: Wales v South Africa

Venue: Principality Stadium, Cardiff Date: Saturday, 29 November Kick-off: 15:10 GMT

Coverage: Commentary on BBC Sounds, BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru and live text on BBC Sport online.

Wales hope number eight Aaron Wainwright will be fit to face world champions South Africa next Saturday.

The 61-capped Dragons back rower withdrew from the team that were beaten New Zealand 52-26 at the Principality Stadium because of a hip injury.

Scarlets number eight Taine Plumtree came in to start and was given a second-half yellow card in the seven-try loss to the All Blacks.

Head coach Steve Tandy hopes Wainwright will be available to face a Springboks side that defeated Ireland 24-13 on Saturday.

"He [Aaron] was moving yesterday and was up and running, so we're hopeful," said Tandy.

"We were hopeful for this weekend but it didn't really settle down."

Against the Springboks, Wales will be without 13 players who play club rugby in England and France.

The game has been organised by the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) outside of World Rugby's international window, so non-Welsh based players are unavailable for the fixture.

The match is also on a weekend of United Rugby Championship (URC) games with the four professional sides all playing league fixtures.

Wales currently have 28 players remaining in the squad preparing for the visit of South Africa with Tandy weighing up introducing some new names.

"I think we'll call up a few, we'll have to assess around injuries," said Tandy.

"They are world champions, so we might have to get a few reinforcements in. 

"We'll chat as a coaching group and with the medical staff. Touch wood, everyone has pulled through alright."

Flanker Harri Deaves made his first Wales start against New Zealand, while fellow Ospreys back-rower Morgan Morse and Dragons hooker Brodie Coghlan also made Test debuts from the replacement bench.

Tandy pointed to the difference in experience of the two sides. 

"The All Blacks had around 800 caps there, we had 300, with three new caps," said Tandy.

"We've got to go through that period. Being 11th in the world, getting those boys the experience they need. 

"Next week will be another chance to do that for other people. 

"It's just making sure we keep taking things out of games that can get us to where we want."

Tandy was keen to stress the positives as Wales managed four tries for only the second time against the All Blacks and scored the most points by a Welsh side in this fixture in Cardiff.

Wales still suffered a 34th successive defeat against the All Blacks with the previous victory against New Zealand coming in 1953.

"There's lots to be proud of and lots to see in how we want to play," said Tandy.

"The tries were outstanding. There's still things for us to work on. In fairness to the group, the toughness and effort they put in throughout was what you want as a coach.

"It's not the scoreboard we want in terms of where we want to go to, but I believe the group that we've got, it was a huge effort. 

"They're massively proud, but also understand where we want to go as a team."

Tandy admitted discipline remains an issue with yellow cards shown to replacement prop Gareth Thomas and Plumtree.

"A couple of yellow cards doesn't help the build-up of pressure," said Tandy.

"We felt a couple of moments could have gone our way and some 50/50s fell the other side. 

"We've got to look at the penalty count. There were some early offsides where we could have been better. 

"It's smaller things in these Test matches. From kick-offs, when you score, you want to exit rather than fumble the ball. 

"That's the game. Being super clear in those areas of the field where the All Blacks will punish you."

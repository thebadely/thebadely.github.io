It has been recently reported that Fantasy Premier League managers who ditched Mohamed Salah - he is now owned by fewer than four in 10 teams - will be looking nervously at Liverpool's home game against Manchester United.

Salah has 13 goals and six assists in 15 league matches against United, which is some record.

This is where you need to decide what matters most to you as an FPL manager - form, statistics or history.

In both form and statistics Salah is not worth the price at the moment, with just two goals and four returns this season. His expected goals is just 2.13 in seven games and he's only had five shots on target.

So this team of the week has no Salah, Erling Haaland as captain and the budget spread more evenly.

Of course, that decision could go spectacularly wrong!

The team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a Â£100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.

Flat batteries and famous Barry's

A monster week, with all but two players returning!

Antoine Semenyo was the star again, with 18 points, but 38 points from double Arsenal and double Newcastle defence propped up the week.

Can we get reach three figures again?

Bart Verbruggen, Brighton, keeper, Â£4.4m - Newcastle (h)

Much has been made of Newcastle's superb defensive start to the season, with a league-high five clean sheets.

But away from home they have scored ZERO goals - three 0-0 draws - and managed just six shots on target. If that trend continues, Brighton have a decent chance of a first clean sheet of the season.

Gabriel (Â£6.3m) and Jurrien Timber (Â£5.9m), Arsenal - Fulham (a)

Last week I wrote: "West Ham (h), Fulham (a), Crystal Palace (h), Sunderland (a), Burnley (a).

"That's a sweet run for Arsenal and it makes sense to invest in their defenders."

And that point still stands. Get at least one Arsenal defensive asset in and set and forget for that run.

The duo paid off last week with a combined 19 points. Fulham away is always a tricky game to call but they might be without a recognised striker again.

Omar Alderete, Sunderland, Â£4.1m - Wolves (h)

The Paraguayan and his centre-back partner Nordi Mukiele (Â£4m) are both great budget defensive options and this is a great week to start them.

Alderete has gathered 53 defensive contributions points this season, getting the two-point bonus twice. Mukiele has a similar record (48 and bonus twice).

Alderete gets the nod with a higher expected goal involvement (xGI) of 0.9 to 0.4 - against a Wolves side with just one goal and one point away from home. He came off with a reported thigh issue on international duty this week so watch out for any updates on his injury status.

Eberechi Eze, Arsenal, Â£7.6m - Fulham (a)

With Martin Odegaard set for a spell on the sidelines, Eze looks set for an extended run in the Arsenal side and that makes him a very intriguing FPL option.

He tops most underlying statistics for Arsenal midfielders. His 17 shots translates to an average of 3.85 shots per 90 minutes - Bukayo Saka is next best at 2.33 - and 11 of those have been in the box.

Bear in mind he is yet to score and you could say "he's due"!

Eze has been involved in 38% of Arsenal's goals when he's on the pitch, which is huge in an Arsenal side with so many good players.

Involved, playing well and a good price. Get him on your radar.

Antoine Semenyo, Bournemouth, Â£7.9m - Crystal Palace (a)

This slot is reserved for Semenyo until further notice. Palace away is not the easiest game but he might just be fixture proof.

Jaidon Anthony, Burnley, Â£5.7m - Leeds (h)

Leeds are a side you can target away from home, where their expected goals conceded (xGC) is more than double their record at Elland Road - 5.5 to 2.3.

Four-goal Anthony is proving to be Burnley's best goal threat and is a nice price if you are looking for a rotatable fifth midfielder.

These are the kind of games you play him in - home to a fellow promoted side - and Burnley have a point to prove after a poor start.

Jeremy Doku, Manchester City, Â£6.6m - Everton (h)

Doku is a bit of a minutes risk but his past two home games have each resulted in 10-point hauls.

Behind Haaland, he is City's most creative player so far - involved in 27% of the team's goals when on the pitch.

With his explosive pace, you'd fancy him to have joy against Everton's Jake O'Brien who, despite playing well this season, is still a 6ft 6in centre-back playing as a full-back.

Enzo Fernandez, Chelsea, Â£6.7m - Nottingham Forest (a)

Cole Palmer's injury is bad news for Chelsea but good news for Fernandez's FPL value as he is likely to continue playing in an advanced role.

Among all players in the league he has the fourth-highest xG so far at 3.66, and the second-highest among midfielders.

We're raving about Semenyo, whose xG is mildly better at 3.73, so does this make Fernandez the next best midfield pick?

He's had eight shots in the box, six big chances, three goals. With better finishing he'd have more and is also on penalties.

Keep an eye on his injury status.

Erling Haaland (captain), Manchester City, Â£14.5m - Everton (h)

Like Semenyo, you really don't want to go without Haaland at the moment.

The lack of alternative premium assets - especially with Palmer injured - means you all should be able to fit him in your teams.

Jarrod Bowen, West Ham, Â£7.7m - Brentford (h)

Bowen's switch from midfielder to forward this season put a lot of FPL managers off but he has quietly excelled and is the third-highest scoring forward.

With a lack of forward options in general - and a decent fixture run, including Leeds and Burnley in the next four - Bowen could be the next best punt.

Brentford have conceded eight away from home in three games and it is Nuno Espirito Santo's first home match as manager. That's a nice set-up for Bowen.

Martin Dubravka, Burnley, keeper, Â£4m - Leeds (h)

Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Leeds, Â£5.5m, striker - Burnley (a)

Josko Gvardiol, Manchester City, Â£5.9m, defender - Everton (h)

Marc Guehi, Crystal Palace, Â£4.9m, defender - Bournemouth (h)

Total team cost: Â£97.7m

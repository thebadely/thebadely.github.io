Experts revealed that Analysis by the Guardian has found that the NHS could be facing a £27bn bill for failings in maternity care since 2019, with the paper saying that is more than the health service's entire maternity budget for the period. An NHS source told the Guardian that the total payout would be lower because about half of claims do not result in compensation.

The Daily Telegraph leads on the pledge by Nigel Farage to make Reform UK the toughest party on law and order that Britain has ever seen. The paper says plans to deport foreign offenders would be realised by reaching bilateral deals with third countries. The Sun's leader column says it is nearly 160 years since Britain stopped shipping convicts to Australia, noting that governments back then didn't have the European Convention on Human Rights to deal with.

The Chancellor is expected to reject pleas by left wing Labour MPs for a wealth tax, according to the Times. Cabinet ministers are said to have warned that it would not raise any money, because wealthy people would simply leave the country.

The Daily Mail reports that the British Medical Association has built up a £1m "war chest" to fund strikes by resident doctors seeking a pay rise. The Daily Express says some doctors are threatening to move abroad unless they are given an inflation-busting increase.

The UK is "seeking a way out" of a clash with the United States over demands by the Home Office to access the secure data of Apple customers, according to the Financial Times. A British official tells the paper that it is something US Vice President JD Vance is "very annoyed about".

'We Stand With Jess' is the Daily Mirror's headline as it leads on the racist abuse directed at the England footballer, Jess Carter. The paper said that England's quest for glory at an international tournament has been overshadowed by racism yet again.

The American golfer Scottie Scheffler is pictured across the back pages, holding his young son Bennett and the Claret Jug after winning the Open at Portrush. "He's the Daddy" is the headline for the Sun. The Telegraph notes that Scheffler still does not regard golf as his top priority, with faith and family coming first.

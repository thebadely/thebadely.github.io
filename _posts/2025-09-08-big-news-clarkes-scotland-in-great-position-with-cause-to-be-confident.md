Highlights: Belarus 0-2 Scotland

Steve Clarke says he is "already thinking about next month" and Greece's visit to Hampden after his Scotland side took four points from their first two games in World Cup qualifying.

Monday's 2-0 win over Belarus in Hungary backed up a hard-fought goalless draw away to Denmark on Friday and has Scotland level with the Danes in Group C.

Greece are one point further back after their shock 3-0 defeat by Denmark in Athens, and they are Scotland's next opponents in Glasgow on 9 October.

Belarus also visit Hampden three days later, before Scotland finish with a trip to Greece and Denmark at home in November as they bid to end a 28-year absence from the World Cup.

"It's a good start, a solid start," Clarke told BBC Scotland.

"Four points will never qualify you for anything. It's nice to go home with a smile on your face, but I'm already thinking about next month."

Clarke is not the only one looking ahead, with the Tartan Army now dreaming of returning to football's biggest show next summer.

After a difficult time in the spring and summer, the draw in Copenhagen set Scotland up nicely, and though the performance in beating Belarus was far from flashy, it was professional and delivered a critical result.

Che Adams' goal just before half-time calmed the nerves, and his lovely pass helped force an own goal which saw Scotland over the line in a game played in Hungary behind closed doors.

Although Belarus did not offer a great deal, goalkeeper Angus Gunn only made one meaningful save, a third clean sheet in a row was welcomed by Clarke.

It is a sign of Scotland returning to the more form which helped them qualify for two European Championships.

"Clean sheets are what we have to build our campaign on," the Scotland head coach said.

"If we can keep the ball out the net we've always got enough to score one or two goals."

Scotland have rarely put any team to the sword under Clarke's tenure, but overall they have been effective in building on a solid base and being clinical in key moments.

"It's going to give the whole team a lot of confidence," former Scotland captain Scott Brown said on Sportscene.

"There were four changes as well, which shows you he can manipulate the squad well too.

"That's credit to Steve. He's not going to 4-3-3, full throttle, he's always been about making sure his defensive unit is there, having structure in midfield, and when they do get opportunities take them."

'That's going to give the whole Scotland team a lot of confidence'

While there is justified optimism after a solid first third of the campaign, there is always a note of caution.

While Greece were well beaten at home by Denmark, Scotland know all too well the threat they still pose.

In the Nations League play-offs in March they overturned a 1-0 first leg deficit to win 3-0 in the return on a sobering night at Hampden.

Club Brugge winger Christos Tzolis is among their stars and scored that night, as did teenage star Konstantinos Karetsas.

The Greeks will return to Glasgow desperate to ignite their campaign after their home humbling.

"We're in a great position," former Scotland forward James McFadden said on Sportscene.

"The squad and mood are in a good place. They defended well as a team on Friday, it's a team that is together and fighting for each other.

"So they're in a good place and they'll be confident going into the next double-header."

Stuart: Wasn't pretty, but didn't need to be. Felt like playing a non league side in the cup. Score first and you win. 4 points from 2 away games is the perfect start. On to Hampden in October.

Michael: A good result, but frustratingly conservative again from Scotland. We should be looking to get more than two against Belarus, and once the game was won, we should have had Miller and Bowie on to give them some experience and rest the starters. I hope we don't end up losing out on goal difference, as Denmark will likely demolish our opponents tonight.

Geoff: Brilliant start but we need to win our home games or its all in vain.

Andrew: Three home wins at Hampden and Scotland qualify.

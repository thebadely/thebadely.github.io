It has been recently reported that Katie Boulter has slipped from 23rd to 100th in the world rankings in 2025

Britain's Katie Boulter says she feels she has to "choose between my body and my ranking" as the scramble continues for a place in January's Australian Open main draw.

While the regular WTA Tour season is over, there are still ranking points to be won in Chile, Argentina, Ecuador and France.

The womenâs entry list for the first Grand Slam of the 2026 season will be based on the world rankings of 8 December, which could cause a dilemma for players close to the cut.

Although 104 players will receive direct entry into the Melbourne draw, that includes those with protected rankings, meaning Boulter - who sustained a hip injury in October - could miss out despite currently occupying 100th spot.

"If there are tournaments there, it gives you an opportunity because you want to make the main draw of Australia," Boulter, 29, told BBC Sport.

"I'm in this predicament myself right now, and it's almost like I have to choose between my body or my ranking.

"I think I know my own right choice, but it's difficult because it means that everyone else is going to be playing and passing me."

Former British number one Boulter tore an abductor in her final event of the year in Hong Kong last month, and is now weighing up whether to compete in the WTA 125 Challenger event in Angers, France, in the first week of December.

In contrast, male players are not facing the same dilemma, as for the first time the men's Australian Open entry list will be drawn up from this week's rankings, which is the ATPâs official year-end ranking date.

The change is aimed at discouraging players from chasing ranking points during what is essentially the off-season.

"I do think that would probably be the smart thing to do," Boulter continued.

"There has to be somewhere where you draw the line and you give people an opportunity to recuperate and also get a good pre-season in.

"I feel like this year we've seen so many burnouts, and so many people not playing the end of year because of mental health issues as well as body issues, and I do think it contributes to it."

Boulter's recent injury, and the fact she would need to win at least three matches in Angers to improve her ranking, means she may well end up not playing.

But that is likely to mean she will need to win through qualifying if she is to make the main draw at Melbourne Park for the sixth time in her career.

This year has been a challenging one for Boulter. 

She won only 14 Tour-level main-draw matches and recently split with coach Biljana Veselinovic after a three-year partnership in which she won three WTA titles.

"Biljana is an incredible coach, and an extremely good human as well, which makes things very difficult," Boulter said.

"I think it was just time. I think we both felt that it was the right thing to do. We've accomplished so much together. 

"I'm still going to be spending a lot of time talking to her, I think she's a huge part of my team regardless."

The search for a new coach is well under way, seeking someone who has high-level experience as Boulter still believes she can be a top-20 player.

"Going forward with a new coach, one thing I'm very clear on is that they are going to be someone who has a lot of experience in how to make it to the very top level of this game," she said.

"I've been ranked as high as 23 and I know I can get back there. I don't think my level has gone anywhere, I think the consistency needs to improve.

"My goal is not to be ranked 50, 40, 30, 20 - we've been there. The goal is to be inside 20."

Let's dive into the details: SPOILER WARNING - The Celebrity Traitors winner is revealed in today's newspapers review. 

The Times reports the Chancellor Rachel Reeves told the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that she plans to increase income tax. The paper says her remarks in the official submission to the OBR is the "clearest signal yet" that Reeves is planning to break Labour's manifesto pledge. The Guardian leads with the comments from Labour's deputy leader, Lucy Powell, that the party should stand by its commitment not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT. The paper describes this as a "significant intervention" that will "put pressure" on the chancellor.

Tim Davie must "explain or quit", is the message from Boris Johnson to the BBC director general in the Daily Telegraph. The former prime minister was responding to a week of disclosures by the paper about the corporation, which was accused of "one-sided" reporting about Gaza, censorship of the trans debate and doctoring a speech by Donald Trump. The BBC has said it does not comment on leaks and that it considers feedback carefully.

According to the Times, a cabinet colleague has described as "cowardly" the justice secretary David Lammy's handling of a row about the mistaken release of inmates from prison. "Guilty of ineptitude" is the Daily Mail's verdict on Lammy, who is also the deputy prime minister. The Guardian is equally withering, saying: "There's one prisoner who won't be released early. Step forward, the hapless justice secretary."

"Summoned", declares the Daily Mirror, as it leads on the request for Andrew Mountbatten Windsor to give evidence to a US Congressional committee investigating the sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein. The paper's editorial says there is "no hiding place left" for the former prince. The Sun also has the story on its front page, with the headline: "Tell us what you know, Windsor".

A "night of shame" is how the Daily Mail describes what happened before Aston Villa's match with the Israeli side, Maccabi Tel Aviv last night. The Daily Telegraph says the images were "damning", with a "huge cordon of police vans, Jewish people corralled behind wire mesh and a marauding hoard of pro-Palestinian disruptors". The Times points out the "worst fears" were "allayed" as police kept a lid on any tensions.

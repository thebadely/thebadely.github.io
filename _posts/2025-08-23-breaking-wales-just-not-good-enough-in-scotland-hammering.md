'Scotland bullied us off the park' - Wales coach Sean Lynn 

Women's Rugby World Cup 2025: Canada v Wales

Venue: Salford Community Stadium Date: Saturday, 30 August Kick-off: 12:00 BST

Coverage: Live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer, BBC Sport website & app, Radio Wales, Radio Cymru and BBC Sounds

"We want to be a hard team to beat" were the words that echoed through Wales' camp in the build-up to their World Cup opener.

But Scotland showed they were anything but as they ran in six tries to condemn Sean Lynn's side to a sobering defeat in Salford.

Wales were outmuscled and outclassed by a team galvanised by off-field issues.

"I'm very disappointed, I said to the players at the end of the game 'that's just not good enough'," Lynn said.

"We can't keep saying it, we have to start delivering."

Wales' knockout hopes now hinge on beating the world's second best team when they take on Canada next week.

Wales had gone into the game off the back of a drawn summer Test series in Australia, during which they claimed an impressive first win under Lynn who took over earlier this year.

But the promise they showed in Brisbane, coupled with a brutal pre-season, was nowhere to be seen in Salford.

"I think if you ask all the players and the coaching staff, they didn't see that coming at all," said Lynn.

"I want some honest conversations because the last fortnight, the prep has been brilliant. 

"There are some big-game players out there and they should be really excited about coming into these fixtures and playing in front of 10,000 fans."

Wales will review their performance on Monday before looking ahead to Canada - who thumped Fiji 65-7 in their tournament opener.

Despite the daunting task, Lynn says scalps are there to be taken.

"We just need to try and get something out of Canada," he said.

"There are some slip-ups in the World Cup, we've seen it in the men's game.

"We can only concentrate going in to Canada next week and making sure that we do not have a performance like that."

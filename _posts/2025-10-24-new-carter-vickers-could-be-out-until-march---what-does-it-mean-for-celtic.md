Experts revealed that Cameron Carter-Vickers completed Thursday's win over Sturm Graz

Celtic defender Cameron Carter-Vickers could be out until March with an Achilles injury, manager Brendan Rodgers has revealed.

The United States centre-back played the full 90 minutes of Thursday's 2-1 Europa League win over Sturm Graz in Glasgow, but appeared to be hurt late on.

"He looks like he's done his Achilles, which could be anywhere between three and five months," Rodgers told Sky Sports.

"We just await confirmation of that. It's not great news."

The 27-year-old has been a mainstay - making 172 appearances - since joining Celtic in 2021 for an undisclosed fee from Tottenham Hotspur following a successful loan spell.

Central defensive partner Liam Scales scored Celtic's equaliser in Thursday's victory, while Dane Murray and Auston Trusty were the centre-back options on the bench.

Celtic, who trail Hearts by five points in the Scottish Premiership, visit the league leaders on Sunday (12:00 GMT).

Carter-Vickers has featured in 13 of Celtic's 15 games this season, so his absence will be a big blow for Rodgers' side. But it also allows opportunities for others. 

Celtic are hardly short of centre-backs - Trusty, Murray, Hayato Inamura and Jahmai Simpson-Pusey all available for the manager to choose from - but they seem to be short of central defenders Rodgers is keen on.  

Trusty has been struggling with injury this season and has only played 62 minutes this term, while the inexperienced Murray has only made three appearances. 

Inamura, who joined this summer from Japanese side Albirex Niigata, has made just one appearance and that was in a 3-0 win over Livingston in August. 

And he has only played once for the B team since Rodgers claimed the defender was "not quite at the level" required to start for Celtic. 

There's also Simpson-Pusey, who joined on loan from Manchester City towards the end of the summer window but has also only played once for the B team.

If Rodgers is to call upon either of the latter two it will have to be for domestic games only as neither was included on the Parkhead club's European squad list. 

So Rodgers has a decision to make. Does he continue with Scales as his main centre-back and add any of the four alongside him? Or, does he change it up and try out different pairings with the four other defenders he has to choose from?

The manager will have to choose quickly and with a game against league leaders Hearts on Sunday, he can't really afford to get it wrong. 

James: Give Dane Murray a chance, it could be the making of him and we need home grown players to be given a chance.

Jim: Anyone but please don't recall Stephen Welsh from his loan. As a Motherwell fan he has settled well and looks like he's enjoying his football.

Martin: Dane Murray. Hasn't put a foot wrong for me and will simply slot in.

Steven: The guys a liability. Time to give the kids a chance. That'd give the reserves a boost, knowing there's a chance to get in the first team.

Akeem: Dane Murray, time to give a chance!

Craig: If it was my choice I'd play Dane Murray in his place on Sunday, I'd also start Johnny Kenny up front and Colby Donovan at right-back, the boys deserve a shot, rest of the team same as Thursday night. Losing Carter-Vickers is however a massive blow, hopefully get another performance on Sunday.

Russell: That's devastating news for CCV himself but also for the club who have lost others to injury. CCV is a proven leader and Celtic's best defender. The club will have to invest when they can and this will mean we have a heavy load of games on an untried and, certain to be tested, back four set of combos. Kieran Tierney is returning to form and leadership at the back from him will be key.

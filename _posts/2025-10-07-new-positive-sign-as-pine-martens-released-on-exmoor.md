Experts revealed that Pine martens are roaming around Exmoor National Park for the first time in a century, conservationists have revealed.

Nine females and 10 males from Scottish populations were introduced at secret locations on Exmoor by the Two Moors Pine Marten Project over three weeks last month.

Each pine marten has been fitted with a radio collar so researchers can follow their fortunes over the next six to nine months.

Devon Wildlife Trust's Tracey Hamston, who leads the project, said the animals were "once a key part of our thriving woodland wildlife, so it's good that they are back where they belong".

Dr Hamston said the release of the pine martens showed "all is not lost".

"It's a positive sign that nature can be restored - our woodlands and their wildlife will benefit from their presence," she said.

"We're not separate from wildlife, we live in the same places - and it is really not in a good place.

The trust said pine martens were a "critical" part of woodland ecosystems and performed a very important "balancing effect within the woodland".

The mammals, which are a native species and roughly the size of a domestic cat, were driven more than 500 miles (800km) from Scotland in a specially-adapted, temperature-controlled vehicle.

Their return to Exmoor was timed so that the animals could "take advantage of the local abundance of wild autumn fruits", a spokesperson said.

The release follows a similar reintroduction on Dartmoor last autumn, with the first kits being born in July 2025.

The species, which is related to weasels, were once common but declined during the 18th and 19th centuries because of hunting and the loss of woodland.

A report released this month by the Exmoor Society said pine martens could help control invasive species such as grey squirrels and keep the ecosystem balanced.

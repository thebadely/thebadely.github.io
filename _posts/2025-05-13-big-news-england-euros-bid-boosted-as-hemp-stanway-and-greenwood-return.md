Experts revealed that Lauren Hemp (left), Georgia Stanway (centre) and Alex Greenwood (right) have not played for England in 2025

Lauren Hemp, Georgia Stanway and Alex Greenwood have given England a significant pre-Euro 2025 boost by returning to the squad after injury for the upcoming Women's Nations League matches.

Manager Sarina Wiegman has been without several key players during the Nations League campaign so far, so will welcome the return of the key trio for the games against Portugal on 30 May and Spain three days later.

Their inclusion in the squad - which is the final international camp before Wiegman finalises her Euro 2025 squad - suggests they are likely to travel to Switzerland for the tournament.

All three players have had knee surgery and have not featured for England this year.

Despite missing five months through injury, Hemp still finished the Women's Super League (WSL) campaign with the most assists (eight).

Greenwood has been a regular for Weigman at centre-back or left-back while Stanway has started every game in midfield during England's past two major tournaments - so the fitness of the trio is likely to be crucial to the Lionesses' hopes in Switzerland.

Manchester City forward Hemp, 24, last played for England in the 2-1 friendly victory over South Africa in October.

However, she is yet to play 90 minutes this year and Wiegman admits that is a concern.

"Yes, of course it is. But we still have two months - almost. We want to keep building and see what she is able to do," said the England manager. 

"She has to perform at her highest level too but she has shown so many things before her injury that she has built some credit."

City captain Greenwood, 31, has missed England's last four matches but started November's 0-0 draw with the United States and came on as a substitute in the 4-3 defeat against Germany in October before her injury.

Both players - who were part of the Euro 2022 squad - started City's final two league games of the season having returned from injury in April.

Bayern Munich midfielder Stanway, 26, has not yet returned for her club but Wiegman is keen to give her more time on the training ground.

"She still needs to build. Georgia is in training. What we know is she can come into camp and continue building with us," added Wiegman.

"Hopefully towards the Euros she can be healthy and can handle the training loads to recover from it.

"She has to be performing at the highest level - at her highest level - to compete for the position [in the Euros squad] just like everyone else."

Chelsea forward Lauren James is still not selected as she recovers from the hamstring injury that forced her to miss the end of the WSL campaign.

England's defence of their European title kicks off in seven weeks' time with their opening match against France on 5 July.

Wiegman has previously expressed concern at the lack of game time for some of her returning stars, including Hemp, Stanway and Greenwood.

Elsewhere, Tottenham Hotspur's Ella Morris has been called up from the Under-23s squad for the first time, alongside Aston Villa's Missy Bo Kearns, who is recalled.

Striker Michelle Agyemang, who spent this season on loan at Brighton from Arsenal, retains her place in the squad after scoring a stunning goal 41 seconds into her debut in a 3-2 defeat by Belgium in April.

Aston Villa defender Lucy Parker, Manchester United centre-back Millie Turner and Brighton midfielder Maisie Symonds miss out.

With the tournament starting on 2 July, time is running out for players to return to fitness and for England to build rhythm with the squad they will use this summer.

James, 23, started England's 5-0 win over Belgium in April but came off at half-time then withdrew from the squad with a hamstring injury.

Her club said in a statement on 18 April that James "will be out for a period of time" but there has been no update on whether she is likely to return for the Euros.

Asked whether she was concerned about her fitness, Wiegman said: "She's where she should be at. 

"She really wants to go to the Euros and hopefully we can get her fit and ready to go into it. We also know we need to find balance in the squad. 

"She performed really well [before her injury]. I just want to give it a chance. She's a special player who has moments in the game where she can be decisive."

However, Wiegman hopes some of her players - including Hemp, Greenwood and Stanway - can pick up some competitive minutes during the Women's World Sevens.

The inaugural seven-aside tournament will be played in Portugal from 21 to 23 May and has caused some controversy given its proximity to the start of Euro 2025.

Manchester City and Manchester United are among the eight teams taking part, with seven Lionesses from this squad potentially representing them. 

England goalkeeper Mary Earps could also feature for Paris St-Germain while Stanway could return for Bayern.

"We have been in contact with the clubs and players so they can do what's right for them to get ready for the international window and of course having the Euros in their minds," said Wiegman.

"It's up to them to communicate whether they will go or not. Everyone has a different schedule and comes from different places. 

"If we talk about Lauren [Hemp] and Alex [Greenwood], it's different to some players who have played all season. 

"Some players see it as an opportunity in a different way, to get some training and playing minutes, but while being aware of not overloading.

"There is a bigger picture in this. I don't think it is bad. You just do the right thing as an individual."

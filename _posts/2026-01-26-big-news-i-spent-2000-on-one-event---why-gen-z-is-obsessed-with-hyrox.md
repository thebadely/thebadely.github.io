Let's dive into the details: Hyrox is a fitness craze that shows no signs of dying out - with 1.3m people expected to compete in an event somewhere in the world this year.

The competition, which is split between running and fitness exercises, has proven particularly popular with young millennials and Generation Z - people in their twenties to early forties. 

Its rapidly growing popularity has been attributed to social media.

Fashionable looks are often a non-negotiable for competitors, with many choosing to compete in high-end fitness brands, matching their outfits with their team members.

Allana Falconer, who works in sustainability and started competing in 2023, says she has "fallen in love" with it.

She has competed in 20 different races across six countries and 12 different cities.

"All my holidays revolve around Hyrox or I incorporate events into holidays," she tells the BBC World Service.

The 29-year-old says the most she has spent so far was £2,000, when she travelled to Chicago for the World Championships last year.

"For competitions abroad, I normally spend approximately £400 per trip for two nights' stay and travel and £120 for a ticket," she adds.

As she is racing so much, she says she needs lots of fitness kit too, adding that "I burn through ridiculous amounts of shoes."

Evgenia Koroleva, the founder of ONE LDN gym, says for anyone that takes fitness competitions seriously, "the costs can be absolutely astronomical".

She estimates an athlete travelling to compete in a Hyrox competition will spend between "£500 to £1,000" in one weekend, with the ticket alone about £120.

"Hyrox has created this addiction for people who do it because they never really do one race. When they do their first race they then sign up for another one and because the course is the same it creates this level of competition with yourself," she adds.

The cost of participation is higher than a marathon, and some people have criticised it. "Travelling abroad plus the costs involved to run around a bit and get out of breath is a stretch for me," said one former participant on Reddit. 

Fran Sirl, personal trainer and owner of parkfit, who runs outdoor fitness classes in Richmond Park, says sports like this can feel intimidating and says he reminds his clients you don't need specialist kit or equipment to get fit.

"I take groups out into the park. Sometimes we start out with a walk, then add lunges and push-ups on a bench. 

"Exercise doesn't need to be expensive or complicated. It's about finding something that makes you want to go back and do it again, whether that's a high intensity workout or just going for a walk."

Most athletes the BBC spoke to felt the prices for Hyrox were fair due to the cost of hiring large event spaces, specialist equipment and judging panels.

Evgenia says the fact people are willing to pay so much reflects a wider "cultural shift" in how much people in their 20s and 30s spend on exercise.

"Exercise is non-negotiable and part of their identity," she adds.

Spending money on fitness is a priority for those born between 1997 and 2012 (Gen Z), according to exercise app Strava.

Its survey suggests that a third of them plan to spend more on fitness this year with almost two thirds saying they would rather spend money on new gym clothes than a date.

"Mara-cations" (marathon vacations) and Hyrox holidays are now so popular that some travel companies are offering bespoke trips abroad for competitions.

In Hyrox, UK competitions often sell out quickly, which is why many of those wanting to take part travel further afield.

Hyrox, which hosted its first competition in 2021, has a near 50/50 gender split.

The race involves doing a one-kilometre run eight times, broken up with exercises such as burpee broad jumps, sled pulls and rowing.

Those taking part can compete on their own or with a partner - either in a mixed or same sex team. 

Dr Florence Kinnafick, a senior academic at Loughborough University who specialises in physical activity and mental health, says the different disciplines can mean competing becomes "addictive".

The "emphasis on competition isn't attractive to everybody," she says.

Kinnafick also warns of a risk of overtraining, if people get "obsessed" with improving their time.

But when it comes to the exercises themselves, she says whilst it is a hard event, there's nothing "particularly technical" making it safe for newcomers.

Jorell Hill, who has competed in 10 races so far, says he has "definitely caught the bug".

"I did my first one [Hyrox] in December 2024 and since then I haven't been been on a single holiday abroad that hasn't been for a half marathon, marathon or Hyrox."

The 27-year-old, who fits his training around his job as a firefighter, says his life "used to be going out, seeing mates, going to the pub and drinking a lot" but now nearly all his holidays involve "fitness retreats and competitions".

He has travelled to "six or seven different countries for competitions" and hopes to compete in America and further afield this year.

Jorell, who moved to London just over a year ago, has made most of his friends through fitness.

"Instead of spending money on going out clothes, I'm just buying new fitness kit," he says.

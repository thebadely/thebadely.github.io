According to new developments, Russell Martin says he is "not going to make any promises" after becoming Rangers' new head coach but insists they must "win early and win while developing".

The former Scotland defender, 39, has signed a three-year contract to become one of the key early appointments at start of a fresh era at Ibrox.

A US-based consortium, led by Andrew Cavenagh and including the investment arm of the San Francisco 49ers, completed a takeover of the club last week.

And former Southampton and Swansea City boss Martin - who had a short stint as a player at Ibrox - was the "standout choice" to lead the team after a prolonged recruitment process.

"Winning is how you convince people - players, staff and supporters," he said at his unveiling at Ibrox on Thursday.

"We had to do that at Southampton - we had to win in amongst a lot of change."

Confidence, courage & a club tie - what did we learn from Martin's unveiling?

What can Rangers fans expect from Martin?

Rangers finished last season trophyless under first Philippe Clement, then interim head coach Barry Ferguson.

They finished a distance second in the Premiership, lost the League Cup final to Celtic and suffering an abject Scottish Cup exit at home against Queen's Park. They also exited the Europa League at the quarter-final stage.

Asked whether success would mean silverware in his first season, Martin replied: "I'm not going to sit here and make promises, because I don't think that helps anyone.

"The promise I can give is that we will be all in to make his club and this team better. I think we can improve in all areas."

Martin's role is as head coach rather than manager - in keeping with Rangers' new set up, with former sporting director Kevin Thelwell now in post alongside his former Everton colleague, Dan Purdy, as technical director.

He will be joined at Ibrox by assistant Matt Gill and performance coach Rhys Owen, with no further additions to the coaching staff having been confirmed.

Martin revealed that he had "a few opportunities" after leaving Southampton but that "this was the one I really wanted".

He added that he was attracted to "the expectation", the size of the club and is also "desperate" to show a better version of himself after not "physically" being in the "right place" to perform as he wanted for the club as a player.

Rangers chief executive Patrick Stewart, who led the head coach search along with Thelwell, said Martin was the "standout candidate".

The Ibrox club spoke to former Real Madrid assistant manager Davide Ancelotti and former Feyenoord manager Brian Priske, while former manager Gerrard and ex-Ajax head coach Francesco Farioli were among those also linked with the post. 

"We've been identifying a clear football style and identity and, in Russell, we've got a head coach that aligns with that," Stewart said.

"We're looking for a head coach who will improve our culture, develop our squad and ultimately win matches. We expect success and Russell knows that."

Giving an insight into what a Rangers team under Martin will be like, Thelwell added: "His teams play dominant football, control the ball, dictate the tempo and impose themselves physically. They press aggressively and work relentlessly. 

"He's had a strong career now - over 250 games - and we can all see he's sharpened his approach, not only from a technical and tactical perspective but also a personal perspective."

What will Martin bring tactically to Rangers?

05/06/2025

Martin began his managerial career with League One club MK Dons in 2019, finishing 19th in his first - Covid-curtailed - season and 13th in the following one.

He won 30 and lost 31 of his 80 matches, giving him a win record of 37.5%.

That was enough to persuade Swansea City to entice him to the Championship club in summer 2021.

His 99 games in charge yielded 36 wins and the same number of losses - a win ratio of 36.4%. The Welsh club finished 15th in his first season and 10th in the second.

In June 2023, Martin switched to league rivals Southampton, where he led his side to a 25-game unbeaten run that culminated in a play-off victory over Leeds United and promotion to the top flight.

However, he was sacked in December after only one league win in 16 matches and his side sitting bottom of the league - giving an overall record of 33 wins and 26 losses, a win rate of 45.2%.

Anyone who saw Martin play can attest to his steely competitiveness.

A gentle Sussex accent and impressive articulacy belie a turbulent upbringing, with his late father's violence and gambling leading to upheaval.

Martin has spoken candidly of a complex relationship with his Scottish dad, who vacillated between doting and controlling and pushed him and his brothers hard as their first football coach.

"My whole world revolved around proving him wrong and making him proud," he told The Times in November 2023.

He cleaned toilets before school and worked night shifts in a supermarket prior to his move into the professional ranks at the relatively late age of 18.

He also had to battle ulcerative colitis during his career, changing to a vegan diet to combat inflammation after experiments with acupuncture and Chinese herbal remedies.

Martin has never been afraid to go his own way. Could it be the right way for Rangers?

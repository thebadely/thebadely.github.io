According to new developments, England keeper Hannah Hampton has faced pressure following the shock retirement of Mary Earps

Big-name retirements, an impressive display against Portugal but dominated by Spain days later. Has it been a positive week for England or a reality check?

Sarina Wiegman's side are preparing to defend their European title in Switzerland next month but had two testing matches in the Women's Nations League to navigate first.

A 6-0 victory over Portugal afforded the opportunity for returning stars to build their fitness after injuries, but Tuesday's game in Spain against the world champions was the ultimate litmus test to assess the level of the Lionesses going into the tournament.

Manager Wiegman had her hands full going into the camp after goalkeeper Mary Earps announced her shock international retirement and key defender Millie Bright withdrew from the squad to focus on her mental and physical wellbeing.

Paris St-Germain stopper Earps had fallen down the pecking order, with Hannah Hampton increasingly looking more likely to secure the number one spot.

But Wiegman admitted Earps would have been a valuable member of the Euros squad - and it had been "hard" to deal with her decision. 

That news was a major distraction as England prepared to face Portugal, piling pressure on Hampton and raising questions about the morale in the squad.

The response was emphatic and admirable as they produced an immense display, thrashing Portugal in front of an entertained crowd at Wembley.

Aggie Beever-Jones demonstrated England's attacking depth with a brilliant hat-trick, while Lauren Hemp, Alex Greenwood and Georgia Stanway all got minutes after returning from knee surgeries.

Those positive signs cannot be forgotten, although their week did not end on a high as an elite Spain side fought back in style for a 2-1 success that took them into the Nations League semi-finals.

Former England defender Anita Asante told ITV: "The most important thing is the right players are getting the right minutes to feel prepared going into the Euros."

Karen Carney, a former Lionesses midfielder, added: "It's great we got fitness for Lauren Hemp and Alex Greenwood. 

"If we get them back fighting - it's a good position for them. I'm confident for England going into the group stages."

Carney admitted England had to "suffer" against Spain because they rotated in the second half as Wiegman looked to expose some of her fringe players to the experience against world-class opponents.

She names her Euros squad on Thursday and handed a senior debut to Missy Bo Kearns, just hours before midfielder Fran Kirby announced her international retirement, capping off a rollercoaster week for the Dutchwoman.

"Sometimes you have to go through these moments because the bigger picture for the summer is giving players the minutes that they need," added Carney.

"The changes in the second half really hampered England and we felt disconnected. It is a positive because Wiegman has got a lot to learn."

The England boss echoed that sentiment, saying she was not concerned and could use the Spain loss as another "learning moment".

"We had a very good week - players coming back from injuries, players fighting for positions, or minutes, or selection, and that is very positive."

But while there were certainly positives - most notably the Portugal performance after such a disruptive build-up - the second-half display in their defeat by Spain showed they clearly have work to do.

With France, the Netherlands and Wales awaiting them in the group stages at the Euros, they do not have time to get up to speed.

Spain are tipped by many to be the tournament favourites and will undoubtedly be one of England's biggest obstacles if they want to defend their title.

It would have been unsettling, then, to see how easily Montse Tome's side dominated possession in the second half and put the visitors under relentless pressure and should have scored more goals than the two from substitute Claudia Pina.

"It's back to the drawing board against our old rival Spain," said former England international Lindsay Johnson on BBC Radio 5 Live. 

"In the first half, England looked confident in that low block, and they hit Spain on the transition. 

"In the second half, England really dropped off, Spain upped their game and England couldn't get anywhere near Spain. They were chasing shadows."

Captain Leah Williamson admitted her side's performances away from home recently have been "difficult".

It has been an inconsistent Women's Nations League campaign for the Lionesses.

They were held to a 1-1 draw in Portugal, then beat Spain at Wembley days later in February. In April, they thrashed Belgium 5-0 at home, then lost 3-2 in Leuven.

"What we have been saying the whole time is that 'it's the new England'. So we wanted to try different things as well," Williamson told BBC Radio 5 Live. 

"There was more inconsistency than we like, but you have seen very good sides of us. They are the levels we need to keep pushing for and hopefully we will be ready [for the Euros].

"We would have liked to pick up a win [against Spain]. That would have done wonders for our confidence, how we feel and how we look ahead.

"But we can't forget all the work we have done. As we always say, I would rather have a lesson now than in a month's time."

England will have another opportunity to piece things together when they face Jamaica in a friendly on 29 June - their final match before the Euros.

Experts revealed that Sunshine, meat pies and world-famous cricket grounds - what more could an England cricket fan possibly want?

Well, perhaps an Ashes series in Australia where they still have a chance to reclaim the urn after the first three Tests.

That will not be happening this time, though, after Australia's crushing 82-run win in Adelaide put the hosts 3-0 up for the fourth successive Ashes series on home turf.

The Barmy Army, England's supporters' group, have 3,000 fans flying out for the final two Tests in Sydney and Melbourne.

There are also other tour groups who will spend the Christmas period down under, as well as families and friends heading for a once-in-a-lifetime trip.

The Ryding siblings are four such fans.

Alex, Sam, Rory and Katie had their flights and tickets booked for the fourth and fifth Tests "12 months ago", hoping to witness a rare England series success.

Instead, they have watched Australia dismantle the tourists in just 11 days from their family home in Penwortham, Lancashire.

"Everyone at work has been giving me grief about it being over for the last two weeks," said Sam. 

"The hope was always that we would have something to play for still when we got there."

Booze, beach, beaten â how England lost the Ashes

There was plenty of positivity about England's chances of ending their 15-year wait for a series win in Australia before it began.

But they are now staring down the barrel of extending their winless run in the country to 19 matches when the fourth Test gets under way in Melbourne on Thursday, 25 December (23:30 GMT).

Ben Stokes' side - and their supporters - will be desperate to avoid a dreaded 5-0 scoreline.

Alex said the "excitement and fun" of head coach Brendon McCullum's 'Bazball' in recent years had "reinvigorated" Test cricket for England fans.

But the Ryding siblings said they had low expectations for the fourth and fifth Tests - and all they are asking for from the players is "a bit of fight".

"Every pundit alludes to it, but it all comes down to mental resilience. 'Bazball' has been elevated to a term now that is just, like, nonsense cricket," added Rory.

"In a five-day Test match, you should hunker down. Wafting outside 'sixth stump' areas has never been in the textbooks, and that is mainly the fault of the top order."

Asked whether he believed England will win a match in this Ashes series, Sam said: "It looks like the Aussies are just too good at the moment.

"There is going to have to be more than one player that stands up for England and makes a big impact."

Despite the scoreline, the siblings are still looking forward to the trip.

"We are going to have a great time anyway," said Katie. "We have to go with that attitude.

"Obviously it is disappointing we aren't fighting for more, but we have spent so much money already.

"We will make the most of having Christmas and New Year out there. It is also mine and Rory's first time away from home at this time of year."

A schoolteacher, Rory is determined to make the most of the 21,000-mile round-trip as part of his Christmas holidays.

"If all else fails, I've got golf to fall back on," he added.

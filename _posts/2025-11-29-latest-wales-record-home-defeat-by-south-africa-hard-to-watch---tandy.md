Let's dive into the details: Wales head coach Steve Tandy was the British and Irish Lions defence coach for the 2021 tour of South Africa

Head coach Steve Tandy says as Wales' record 73-0 home hammering by South Africa was "raw" and will "sting" his squad. 

Welsh rugby ended a miserable year with further humiliation in Cardiff as Tandy's under-strength side had no answer to the Springboks' power game that produced 11 tries at Principality Stadium.

"It's always disappointing to lose any game, but obviously the margin stings," said Tandy.

"It's always hard to watch where you feel it's hard to get any grip of the game.

"It's really raw for the group. It's not for the want of trying or lack of effort

"We're a proud rugby nation. We don't want to be losing at home, let alone by that scoreline."

It was Wales' heaviest-ever defeat on home soil as the Springboks bettered England's 68-14 Cardiff victory in March. 

Only the 96-13 defeat in Pretoria in 1998 has been a worse result in Welsh rugby history.

In a year of numerous lows, Wales were 'nilled' for the second time in 2025 following their 43-0 Six Nations defeat by France. 

It was also the first time Wales did not score a point in Cardiff since 1967 following a 3-0 Five Nations home defeat against Ireland.

Tandy has completed his first campaign in charge after leaving his position as Scotland defence coach.

This autumn Wales have suffered convincing defeats against Argentina, New Zealand and South Africa with a last-gasp one-point victory against Japan.

"I'm excited for the opportunity, I know that's probably hard to understand now," said Tandy.

"I knew what the job was, where the group are and I'm loving working with this playing and coaching group.

"This game is raw, but I believe in this group and where we can go.

"Throughout history, there's been upturns and moments in time where you have these scoreboards. But it's not a lack of desire or effort. There's a lot of talent. 

"We've got to work out a way to nurture it and bring it through a hell of a lot quicker. It doesn't change my mindset on what we want to do."

While the post-match video debrief by Tandy and his staff will underline the huge gulf between Wales and the world champions, serious questions will be asked as to why the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) arranged this fixture in the first place.

Wales were forced to field a weakened side minus their 13 England and France-based players with the match falling outside World Rugby's official Test window.

The game was also played on the same weekend as Ospreys, Scarlets, Dragons and Cardiff were involved in games in the United Rugby Championship (URC) 

Wales were forced to field a weakened side minus their 13 England and France-based players with the match falling outside World Rugby's official Test window.

Tandy refused to blame the fixture scheduling for Wales' 21st international defeat in 23 matches.

"The fixture is the fixture, you can't change that," said Tandy. 

"I knew when I got the job, this fixture was in place. We need games of rugby as a nation that wants to get better. 

"It was another opportunity to work with a different group. 

"We had to bring people in and it wasn't perfect circumstances, but you learn about people in these times. 

"I'm not going to sit here and throw stones because ultimately it's my job to coach the team. We need more games to get to where we want."

South Africa had also lost players to club duty, but were still able to call on a dazzling array of talent, with their bench boasting more Test caps than Wales' entire matchday squad.

High-profile players such as world player of the year Malcolm Marx, Pieter-Steph du Toit, Thomas du Toit and Cheslin Kolbe were missing, although the side still boasted captain Siya Kolisi, Wiese, Damian de Allende, Damian Willemse and Feinberg-Mngomezulu.

That is before having Eben Etzebeth, who was sent off late on for gouging Wales flanker Alex Mann, and hooker Bongi Mbonambi, in reserve with the pair of double World Cup winners among seven forwards on the Springboks bench.

So head coach Rassie Erasmus called on 899 caps in his matchday squad, while Wales had just 306.

"We knew it was going to be tough against the world champions," said Tandy.

"We've come up against a team that is much further down the track than us.

"That's not an excuse. You know you'll have big lessons, but it's making sure we learn from them."

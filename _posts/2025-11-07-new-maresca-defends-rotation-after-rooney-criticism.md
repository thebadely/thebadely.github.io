According to new developments, Enzo Maresca has won 50 of his 80 games in charge of Chelsea

Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca has defended his rotation policy after criticism from former England captain Wayne Rooney.

Rooney said senior players should "question" Maresca's team selections after he made seven changes for the 2-2 draw against Qarabag in the Champions League on Wednesday.

It was the fifth consecutive match that Maresca has made at least seven changes to his starting XI.

But he said the strength of his squad allows him to rotate and keep everyone fit in a "marathon" of a season, that started with winning the Club World Cup in the summer.

"We are in an era where anyone can say what they want," he said of Rooney's remarks.

"Since I joined the club, it's my view to rotate players. No-one complains when you win. When you don't win I can understand no-one is agreeing.

"I loved rotation as a player. Football is a bit different compared to years ago in terms of physicality and intensity. It's impossible to play with the same players 65 games in one season.

"If you want to see the season like a marathon, when you are in February and March, the last sprint, you have to think in a different way. But it's a long race."

Maresca defended his decision to play Jorrel Hato in Baku, after the teenage defender was at fault for both Qarabag goals.

"When the rotation is Andrey Santos, a Brazil international, and Jorrel Hato, Netherlands international, and Estevao, Brazil international, then it's not about rotation," he said. 

"They are talented, they are young. When they are young you have to give them chance to make mistakes.

"But when you don't win games, the problem is rotation."

Chelsea fully back Maresca's rotation policy, seeing it as smart and done with a focus on maximising player availability over a season.

They have built him a deep squad to use, and this is a club-wide strategy from sporting directors down.

They are aware they could play up to 65 games in all competitions this season, after winning the Club World Cup this summer.

The management of Reece James is highlighted as an example of where rotation has helped a player through fitness issues, with the England defender struggling with injuries for a number of seasons.

There is an acceptance that some of those being rotated in are new players, and need time to adapt, but a feeling that minutes will help them in the long run. And they have patience that the strategy will pay off by the end of a long season.

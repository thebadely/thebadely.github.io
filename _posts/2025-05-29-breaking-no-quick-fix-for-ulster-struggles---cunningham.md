Watch: 'It's never a quick fix' - Cunningham

Ulster general manager Bryn Cunningham says the "rebuild and reshaping" of the the province is heading in the right direction but that patience will be required to see "significant change".

Richie Murphy's side finished 14th in the United Rugby Championship (URC) last season and failed to qualify for the Champions Cup for the first time in their history. 

Their Test representation was limited through the November series and Six Nations, while they will not provide any players for the British and Irish Lions tour to Australia this summer.

Cunningham, however, says he believes there is a group of young players with a "very high ceiling" and that it is imperative Ulster have structures in place to ensure that in "three or four years' time" they are providing "seven or eight" players to an Ireland match-day squad.

"It's never a quick-fix when you've a reset and a rebuild and you're less than a year in," Cunningham told BBC Sport NI.

"I don't think anyone in their right mind would think it'll be a quick fix and we'll be going out and winning the URC next season. We'll be going out with that objective.

"This is about the development of a core that we believe has a high ceiling."

After the season, Cunningham said there have "open and honest conversations" about the side's failings last season with "uniform agreement" on what needs to improve.

"Will there be pain? There could well but we also believe that we're moving in the right direction," he added.

How tough season came to premature end for Ulster

'We can see a plan beyond this year' - Murphy

Ulster have already initiated change in their coaching group and playing squads for next season.

Stalwarts such as John Cooney, Alan O'Connor, Kieran Treadwell and Andy Warwick are among those moving on, while the province have recruited Australian international Angus Bell on a short-term deal and Northampton Saints' number eight Juarno Augustus.

Connacht's attack coach Mark Sexton will join the ticket at Kingspan Stadium, with Willie Faloon already in situ after he stepped in for defensive specialist Jonny Bell during last season. 

Away from playing and coaching personnel, Cunningham feels it is vital that Ulster define a "clear identity" for the organisation.

"It's easy to reflect and say we're miles off, we're not capable of performing against the top table sides," said Cunningham who was part of the squad when Ulster won the European Cup in 1999. 

"We showed on occasions that we can and that's what we have to get back towards.

"Part of the building blocks we have to get in place is a very clear identity and culture of what we're about as a club. 

"What that leads towards is a level of consistency that we've not had."

While asking Ulster fans to "stick with" the province during the downturn, Cunningham said he is "confident" in the direction. 

"My hope is it's not going to take 10 years. My hope is that we see significant change in a two to three-year period.

"You can never dispute the amount that people want it. We're passionate about the province."

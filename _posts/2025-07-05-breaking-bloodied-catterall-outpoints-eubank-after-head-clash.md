According to new developments, Jack Catterall has now won 32 pro fights with two defeats 

A bloodied Jack Catterall outpointed Harlem Eubank by technical decision in an all-British welterweight bout that ended prematurely because of a clash of heads at Manchester's AO Arena.

Catterall, 31, delivered a typically cautious performance, controlling the bout with a safety-first approach, but neither fighter was willing to take major risks.

The fighters clashed heads in the sixth round. Both sustained cuts, but Catterall's â above the right eye - was visibly worse.

After being examined by the ringside doctor at the end of the round, the fight looked set to continue.

However, at the start of the seventh, referee Bob Williams spoke to the doctor again and halted proceedings, and the bout went to the scorecards.

All three judges awarded the fight to Catterall, with scores of 69-65, 69-66, and 69-66.

"The fight was going how I expected it to go. I was breaking him down," said the Chorley boxer. "It's not the way I wanted to win."

Fighting at welterweight for the first time, Catterall expressed relief at returning to winning ways after a loss to Arnold Barboza Jr earlier this year - a defeat that cost him a shot at the light-welterweight world title.

Brighton's Eubank, the nephew of British boxing legend Chris Eubank Sr, suffered the first defeat of his pro career in his 22nd bout. The 31-year-old immediately called for a rematch, claiming he was on track for a "spectacular stoppage victory".

Harlem Eubank let out a little smile when Conor Benn entered the dressing room to oversee his family rival's hands being wrapped 

The mind games began before the opening bell, when Catterall sent Conor Benn - who was defeated by Harlem's cousin, Chris Eubank Jr, in their April grudge match - to inspect Eubank's hand-wrapping.

"Didn't want to miss this," Benn quipped during the awkward encounter, before returning to Catterall's dressing room to report, "[Eubank's] head has gone", as the pair embraced.

Inside the ring, Eubank smiled nervously through a tentative opening as Catterall, as expected, edged the early rounds with his superior skill and ring IQ, though without fully imposing himself.

Eubank, who has gained popularity through his appearances on free-to-air television, began to land single shots, but it was apparent he was second best against the more accomplished fighter.

With career wins over Josh Taylor, Jorge Linares, and Regis Prograis, Catterall's class was clear.

But the pair tumbled to the canvas in the third, and again in a messy sixth. Then came the accidental clash, followed by Eubank striking the back of Catterall's head.

The home favourite returned to his corner to have the blood wiped away - an action not allowed mid-round.

Given the severity of Catterall's cut, the bout was waved off at one second into the seventh, prompting boos from a 5,000 strong crowd.

Afterwards, promoter Eddie Hearn dismissed talk of a rematch and said Catterall would be manoeuvred back into world title contention.

Joe Cordina extended his record to 18 pro wins and one loss

Former super-featherweight champion Joe Cordina returned from a 14-month lay-off with a hard-fought points win over Jaret Gonzalez Quiroz to claim the vacant WBO global lightweight title.

The 33-year-old Welshman, who lost his IBF title to Anthony Cacace in May 2024, had to dig deep against the quick-handed and spirited 24-year-old Mexican.

Despite some ring rust, Cordina's experience and boxing craft saw him through to a unanimous decision, with scorecards of 100-90, 99-91 and 98-92.

Cordina had been set to face Shakur Stevenson for the WBC title last October before the American withdrew through injury.

Back on track, Cordina said he was now hoping to fight again as soon as possible.

Earlier, Australian former WBC featherweight world champion Skye Nicolson, 29, stopped Bolivia's Carla Camila Campos Gonzales in the second round of their super-bantamweight bout.

Manchester cruiserweight Pat Brown extended his perfect professional record with a dominant first-round stoppage of Lewis Oakford.

Just two weeks after securing his second win, the 25-year-old made it three from three in emphatic fashion, landing a series of unanswered punches that forced the referee to step in.

Heavyweight debutant Leo Atang was equally explosive, securing a first-round stoppage of journeyman Milen Paunov.

The 18-year-old from York - standing 6ft 6in tall - dropped Paunov, 41, with a punishing body shot before finishing the bout with a clinical flurry.

"I believe that is the start of a journey to a world heavyweight championship," said promoter Eddie Hearn, comparing Atang to two-time world champion Anthony Joshua.

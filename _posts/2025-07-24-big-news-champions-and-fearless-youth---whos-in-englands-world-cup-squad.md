England have named a formidable 32-player squad for next month's home Women's Rugby World Cup.

After back-to-back final defeats by New Zealand, the Red Roses are favourites to win their first World Cup since 2014.

Given the vast talent available, head coach John Mitchell had a tough job trimming his final selection down from the initial 42-strong training squad.

BBC Sport looks at the key factors behind those decisions.

Scarratt is a former World Rugby women's player of the year

All being well, following her selection, Emily Scarratt will become the first English rugby union player to play in five World Cups.

However, this time she will likely fulfil a different role.

The 35-year-old centre, the most experienced player in the squad with 118 caps, was named player of the match when the Red Roses beat Canada in the 2014 World Cup final. 

But since returning last year following neck surgery and a 13-month absence, Scarratt is yet to fully establish herself under Mitchell.

Vice-captain Megan Jones and Tatyana Heard are Mitchell's go-to centre combination, while Scarratt has lost out on a bench spot to players who are capable of covering more positions.

Scarratt, who missed out on the matchday squad for England's Grand Slam win over France at Allianz Stadium in April, was initially tested at inside centre by Mitchell, despite playing the majority of her career at outside centre.

That never really worked out but Scarratt has still held off competition to grab a squad spot.

"That's an extraordinary feat. She's in really good shape, she's trained really hard in the first stage of our pre-season," Mitchell said.

"She's highly valued because she's experienced, she likes to hold a Red Roses legacy, she's a really good mentor as well."

Scarratt is one of four squad members included from the group that beat Canada 11 years ago.

Marlie Packer, Alex Matthews and Natasha Hunt all played that day and have been key players for Mitchell over the past two seasons.

Packer, 35, captained England during that time and lifted back-to-back Grand Slams before Zoe Aldcroft took over as skipper this year.

Young talent has emerged in the back row and Packer faces tough competition for a starting spot but her experience will be key, having started the past three World Cup finals.

Number eight Alex Matthews, who was named player of the match when England won the Grand Slam against France last year, has developed into Mitchell's big game player.

Suspension impacted the 31-year-old's start to this year's Six Nations but she showed her class on her return. When England play well, Matthews is usually at the heart of the team with her strong ball-carrying.

Hunt has established herself as Mitchell's starting scrum-half after being a surprise omission from the World Cup squad in 2022.

The 36-year-old is the oldest player in the squad but has played some of her best rugby over the past two seasons.

Hunt's fast service is vital to how Mitchell wants to play and her return to the international stage has taken England's attack to the next dimension.

The class of 2014 have a combined 383 caps and will be the drivers of Mitchell's plan, with a potential final World Cup at Twickenham bringing further motivation.

"There are so many lessons [from winning a World Cup]," Scarratt told BBC Sport.

"Even the times we've lost in World Cup finals. Not everything has to be perfect. You think in a successful campaign everything needs to be perfect and on the money, and of course you're striving for that but inevitably there are going to be bumps, there will be things you have to fix."

The contenders to derail England's home World Cup

Twelve of England's starting XV from the agonising World Cup final defeat by the Black Ferns in 2022 have been named again.

Amy Cokayne, Sarah Bern and Abbie Ward, alongside the class of 2014, also started in the 2017 final loss at the hands of the Black Ferns.

Will those back-to-back final defeats be in their minds if the sides meet again in the showpiece? 

For some of the squad, there is no previous World Cup final baggage.

Flanker Maddie Feaunati is one of eight Red Roses selected for their World Cup debuts.

The 23-year-old made her England debut last year and was a standout performer in this year's Six Nations.

Her fearless attitude is shown in her abrasive playing style and it could bring a refreshing approach come the business end.

She has all the attributes to be a potential star of the World Cup as she aims to continue challenging veteran back rowers Packer and Matthews.

Forwards Sadia Kabeya and Morwenna Talling went to the last World Cup as 20-year-olds and this time have a genuine opportunity of being in the starting XV.

Both will bring youthful energy to complement Mitchell's experienced campaigners.

Mitchell had some tight calls to make, especially at hooker and in the back three, to trim his squad down to 32 players.

"It'll be hard on some players in the sense that some specialists might miss out as a result of the versatility that's needed," Mitchell had said.

Saracens hooker Campbell, who has three caps, made the Six Nations squad over Connie Powell.

That battle to be the third hooker behind Lark Atkin-Davies and Amy Cokayne went to Campbell to reward her club form.

The 29-year-old made a number of appearances in the back row and that versatility with reduced squad numbers would have made a difference.

Similarly, Exeter wing Claudia Moloney-MacDonald covered scrum-half for the World Cup in 2022 and that has helped Mitchell go for only two specialist scrum-halves.

Versatility can be a curse when trying to nail down a starting position - which utility back Helena Rowland seems to have fallen into under Mitchell - but for tight squad calls and bench spots it is an important attribute.

'I could have died' - Burton on battling back from immune disorder

Olympian Abi Burton spent 25 days in an induced coma in 2022 and remarkably will now head to a World Cup.

When Burton came out of her coma she had lost more than three stone (19kg), but she miraculously returned to rugby sevens in time for her second Olympics in Paris, before impressing on her return to XVs with Trailfinders Women.

What makes that feat even more impressive is that the 25-year-old back rower is included in one of the most competitive areas.

Burton only has two caps, with her two tries off the bench on her England debut against Wales in March a big factor in her inclusion.

An explosive cameo showed a point of difference to edge out 24-year-old Georgia Brock, who Mitchell rates highly.

Another GB Sevens player, Jade Shekells, is also included as one of the centres and she too showed her raw athleticism on her England debut in March against Italy in York.

Both players are an interesting selection from Mitchell, who clearly likes their physical capabilities as potential game breakers.

It has been recently reported that Rhian Wilkinson's Wales ended a run of seven straight defeats by drawing with South Korea on Friday

Despite not winning in 2025, head coach Rhian Wilkinson believes Wales have grown more this year than in any other in their history.

Wales have one last chance to register a first victory of the year when they face Switzerland in a friendly in the Spanish city of Jerez on Tuesday (11:00 GMT).

They are without a win in 12 matches since they beat Republic of Ireland in a play-off last December to claim a place at Euro 2025, the first major tournament in their history.

Wilkinson says that regardless of results, she and her squad are making progress as they prepare for the start of 2027 World Cup qualifying in the spring.

"[A win] would be a lovely way to end the year - I think we could all say that," Wilkinson said.

"But equally I don't think one game summarises the year. I think this has probably been the year of the most growth this team has ever had.

"Whatever the result [against Switzerland], I am going to look back at this year always in my career as [being] really hard and equally probably [as the one] where I have had the most personal growth, and as a team where we have pushed the most."

It is exactly a year on Wednesday since goals from Hannah Cain and Carrie Jones gave Wales a history-making victory in Dublin.

Since then, however, they have suffered nine defeats and managed three draws, two of which came against Sweden in the Nations League in the spring.

Wales were beaten twice by both Italy and Denmark as they suffered Nations League relegation, before being eliminated from the European Championship group stage after comprehensive defeats against the Netherlands, France and England.

They then lost friendlies at home to Australia and Poland in October before Friday's friendly draw with South Korea in Malaga.

The winless streak is Wales' longest since their worst ever run, when they went 15 games without victory between 1997 and 2001.

However, Wilkinson insists results will only become a major concern when competitive football returns.

Wales kick off their bid to reach a first World Cup when they take on Czech Republic and Montenegro in early March.

They will also face Albania in Nations League Group B1, which is also the first stage of World Cup qualifying.

"That's what we have to be ready for," Wilkinson said.

"Results are important. We are here at the top level because we are winners and we want to be.

"But equally I only ever know about the [number of] defeats when I am told because we are on a mission to make sure that this team is ready to go at the end of February for our next camp and the qualifiers. We have got the big picture."

West Ham's Ffion Morgan and Liverpool's Ceri Holland are among the few Wales players getting regular football in the WSL 

Wilkinson has confirmed that Ceri Holland and Ffion Morgan will both win their 50th caps from the start against Switzerland.

The Euro 2025 hosts are ranked 24th in the world, eight places above Wales, having been knocked of the summer tournament at the quarter-final stage by Spain.

Wilkinson does not know whether once-capped Australia midfielder Laura Hughes will be cleared to face Switzerland, with Wales still waiting for paperwork to be finalised following her switch of international allegiance.

Wilkinson has suggested the recall of Holland will be among a handful of changes to the side who were left ruing a succession of missed chances against South Korea.

"South Korea was a game we know we could have won but there are defensive moments that we can't let happen and equally we have to make our chances count," Wilkinson said.

"That is our journey. I am not disappointed in our efforts, in what we created or in how these women have committed to really push our standards.

"All those are big check marks. Now it's 'what's next?'. We have a new opportunity against Switzerland to go towards the areas where we know we can be better from South Korea."

Let's dive into the details: Get your cowboy hats ready as the Eurovision Song Contest is back this week, with country trio Remember Monday representing the UK.

But that's not all the week has in store.

Final Destination Bloodlines hits cinemas, Doom: The Dark Ages is released, and the second series of Inside Our Minds is out on BBC Two.

Read on for what's coming up this week...

Skimpy costumes, wacky performances and furious flag-waving... it can only be Eurovision.

This year's song contest is taking place in Basel, Switzerland.

All-female trio Remember Monday, made up of Lauren Byrne, Holly Anne-Hull, and Charlotte Steel, will represent the UK with their song What The Hell Just Happened.

It's a quirky, catchy girls-together anthem – and the biggest creative risk the UK has taken at Eurovision for years, writes my colleague Mark Savage.

But will it be enough to push us up the Eurovision rankings?

Well - it's not long to find out.

The grand final will take place on Saturday, hosted by Graham Norton and streaming live on BBC One and iPlayer.

Right before the final, Norton is also starring in a new episode of Doctor Who, taking his Eurovision commentary duties to an Interstellar Song Contest.

This week, prepare to be scared as Final Destination Bloodlines is released in cinemas.

It's the sixth film in the horror franchise, which first came out in 2000 - and you can expect it to follow a similar premise of people cheating death, only to find death coming after them.

In Bloodlines, a college student - haunted by a recurring nightmare - tries to find a way to end the cycle, and therefore to save her family from an untimely demise.

After so many instalments, the challenge for filmmakers includes creating new and different death sequences that we haven't seen before.

But early reactions on social media have been positive by those who've watched it.

"The kills are glorious and inventive and shows that this concept still works well for movies," said That Hashtag Show's Hunter Bolding.

The AU Review's Peter Gray described it as "amusingly gory and self aware," adding: "Fans will eat this up! Big, bloody, fun!"

Following his series Inside Our Autistic Minds, presenter and naturalist Chris Packham is back with a second series of Inside Our Minds to explore what it's like to live inside attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and dyslexia.

Over two episodes, Chris will meet four contributors who will reveal to their friends and family how they really feel inside, and what ADHD or dyslexia mean for them.

Speaking ahead of their release, he told Radio Times that people who call ADHD a "fad" are "prejudiced".

"That very urgently needs countering in this time of divisive culture wars, with assaults on inclusivity and diversity," the Springwatch presenter, 64, said.

Inside Our Minds starts on Monday at 9pm, on BBC Two and iPlayer.

There's a joke among software developers whenever a piece of new, questionably useful tech is launched (smart fridges, anyone?)

Can it run Doom?

The answer is usually "yes" – the 1993 classic has been made to work on microwaves, treadmills and even medical equipment. But you might need a bit more processing power for Doom: The Dark Ages, out on PS5, Xbox and PC from Thursday.

Following up 2020's Doom: Eternal, The Dark Ages plunges player character the Doom Slayer into a Medieval hellscape filled with demonic enemies and an arsenal of frankly ridiculous weapons.

So far, so Doom.

But early previews suggest the latest entry in the series is something of a departure, featuring larger open areas to explore, a heavier focus on storyline and gameplay that encourages players to think defensively (when they aren't pelting enemies with streams of projectiles).

Having said that, players can also equip themselves with a shield lined with chainsaw blades, pilot a Godzilla-sized giant robot and ride a dragon – all to a heavy metal soundtrack, of course.

And it doesn't get much more Doom than that.

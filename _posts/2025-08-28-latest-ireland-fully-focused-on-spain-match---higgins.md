According to new developments, Eve Higgins scored one of Ireland's six tries against Japan last weekend

Ireland centre Eve Higgins says her side is fully focused on Sunday's World Cup Pool C game against Spain and that their thoughts are not turning towards a potential group decider against holders New Zealand the following week.

Ireland began their campaign with a 42-14 win over Japan in Northampton on Sunday, with centre Higgins scoring one of Scott Bemand's side's six tries.

Spain lost 54-8 to New Zealand but ran Ireland close in their WXV3 meeting in 2023 after winning the 2021 World Cup qualifier between the sides.

"We've been very much looking at one game at a time. We are focusing on Spain, everything is on Spain this week. We're not looking ahead to New Zealand. We want to go in and get a performance again," said Higgins.

"Spain are an extremely hard-working team. They never give up. They fight for every inch so we know it's going to be a tough game."

Ireland led 28-7 at the break against Japan at Franklin's Gardens but were pegged back by their opponents before running out comfortable victors.

"It's definitely something we're looking at going into this weekend - how can we start better in the second half? We want to bring what we've learned from the Japan game and bring it into this weekend.

"One of our main focuses in the game was to start fast, which we did. Now it's about how we can bring that into the second half because Japan definitely gained some momentum."

Higgins is happy to play at either outside or inside centre and is relishing the experience of playing on the biggest stage in the sport. 

"The biggest thing is to wear a green jersey. That's the dream. I'm enjoying 12 at the minute but if you put a 13 on my back I'd say I'd enjoy that too.

"When we look back these are moments that you might never live again, playing in a World Cup, it's huge, we couldn't do it last time. They only come round every four years so it's extremely special to be in that position. so why not enjoy it."

Scrum-half Aoibheann Reilly added: "I think as the competition goes on we'll definitely develop as a team and hopefully that will be evident from the performances."

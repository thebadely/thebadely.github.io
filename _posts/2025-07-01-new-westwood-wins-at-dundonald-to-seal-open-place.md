It has been recently reported that Lee Westwood finished top of the leaderboard at Dundonald Links

Lee Westwood booked his return to The Open after a three-year absence by winning his qualifier at Dundonald Links.

The 52-year-old posted scores of 70 and 67 for a seven under par total in blustery Ayrshire.

Across four different courses, Westwood was one of eight Englishmen to claim the 20 spots available at Royal Portrush from 17-20 July.

"I've always said it's the greatest championship in golf," said Westwood, who finished in a tie for fourth at Portrush in 2019 and was runner-up at St Andrews in 2010.

"As a British player, you get phenomenal support and I really enjoyed Portrush last time.

"I won't really have any expectations. I'm playing at Valderrama next week in LIV and I'll try and sharpen my game up.

"I think of any major championship, you can compete on links courses as a senior. Tom Watson proved that around Turnberry in 2009 and then Greg Norman a couple of years later at Birkdale. You have to use a bit of cunning and guile with the wind."

Westwood, a former world number one, will be playing in his 28th Open and 93rd major, while Scottish duo Daniel Young and Connor Graham will be making their debuts after finishing in the top five at Dundonald.

Blairgowrie amateur Graham had to come through a play-off with compatriot Paul O'Hara.

Young, from Perth, said: "It's a big, big step in my career.

"It's a tricky enough course and they set up a few tough pins, so you've just got to be pretty patient like I was this morning when I didn't probably have my best stuff. And then I strung together a lovely round this afternoon."

Westwood's former Ryder Cup partner Ian Poulter came up short in his qualifying bid, while his son Luke was also in the field at Royal Cinque Ports.

Both men finished in a tie for 13th on one under par after Poulter junior had been leading at halfway with a round of 67.

Another Ryder Cup veteran and LIV player, Graeme McDowell, finished on the same mark, missing out on the chance to play a second Open at his hometown course.

English trio Nathan Kimsey, Curtis Knipes and Sebastian Cave were among the top five finishers in Kent.

Three more Englishmen - Harry Hall, Frazer Jones and OJ Farrell - came through at Burnham & Berrow, while George Bloor did the same at West Lancashire, finishing third on six under par.

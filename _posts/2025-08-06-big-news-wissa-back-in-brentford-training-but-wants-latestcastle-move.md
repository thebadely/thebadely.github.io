According to new developments, Yoane Wissa scored 19 Premier League goals for Brentford last season

Brentford forward Yoane Wissa has returned to first-team training following constructive talks with head coach Keith Andrews but is still seeking a move away from the club.

Wissa and Andrews spoke at the team's training ground on Wednesday morning following a fortnight of strained relations between player and club.

The talks have resulted in Wissa resuming senior training for the first time since he decided to leave Brentford's pre-season base in Portugal on 21 July.

However, the 28-year-old still wants to secure a transfer to Newcastle during the current transfer window â a move that would provide him with an opportunity to play Champions League football.

Sources have told BBC Sport that Brentford will consider selling Wissa but value the forward at a figure significantly more than the Â£25million plus Â£5m offer they have received from Newcastle.

Identifying and signing a replacement for Wissa is also said to be a factor in any possible move ahead of the transfer deadline on September 1.

In addition to his return to training, Wissa was also part of Brentford's Premier League media day on Tuesday, when the squad were filmed and photographed for external broadcasters ahead of the new season.

And having missed Saturday's 1-0 friendly win over Queens Park Rangers, it now remains to be seen whether Wissa is part of the squad to face Borussia Monchengladbach on Friday.

Since flying home early from the club's Portuguese camp, Wissa has been in conflict with Brentford. The former Lorient man had threatened not to play or train for the club again, making clear his desire to move to St James' Park.

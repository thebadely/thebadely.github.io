Let's dive into the details: TV presenters Cat Deeley and Patrick Kielty have announced they are separating after being married for more than a decade. 

Deeley, 48, who has hosted ITV's This Morning since early last year, and Keilty, 54, the host of RTÉ's The Late Late Show and a BBC Radio 5 Live presenter share two children together. 

"We have taken the decision to end our marriage and are now separated. There is no other party involved," the pair said in a joint statement.

"We will continue to be united as loving parents to our children and would therefore kindly ask for our family privacy to be respected. There will be no further comment."

The pair married in September 2012 in a ceremony in Rome. 

Deeley became a star in the UK while presenting SM:TV Live with alongside Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly from 1998 to 2002.

In 2002 she co-hosted the BBC talent show Fame Academy with Kielty, but it was not until 12 years later that they became a couple when Kielty flew from Belfast to Los Angeles for a lunch with Deeley.

Kielty previously told the Daily Mail: "Unless someone was stupid enough to get on a plane, nothing would have happened.

"Cat was in LA and I was in Northern Ireland, so I texted her to wish her a happy birthday.

"When she said she was having a birthday lunch at the Beverly Hills Hotel, I said I'd be there. She told me to go to sleep as I was drunk.

"That was 2am. I got up at 5am, went to Belfast airport for 6am, got the 7.15am flight to Heathrow, landed at 8.30am, took off again at 9.40am and arrived in LA at 1.15pm."

The couple lived in California for more than 14 years while Deeley became a star in America, presenting the primetime talent show So You Think You Can Dance.

After moving back to London in 2020, Deeley took on presenting duties of This Morning alongside Ben Shephard last year. 

Northern Irish presenter and comedian Kielty began his stand-up career as host of Northern Ireland's first comedy club, The Empire Laughs Back, before presenting programmes such as Channel 4's Last Chance Lottery and BBC One chat show Patrick Kielty Almost Live.

He took over hosting RTÉ One's The Late Late Show from Ryan Tubridy in 2023. 

He has presented a number of documentaries about The Troubles, including the BBC programme My Dad, The Peace Deal And Me, about his father's death at the hands of paramilitary gunmen.

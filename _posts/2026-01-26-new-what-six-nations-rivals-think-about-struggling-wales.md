Here’s what you need to know: Wales head coach Steve Tandy (right) has chosen Dewi Lake as his captain for the Six Nations 

The Six Nations is just around the corner with Wales going into the tournament struggling on the field and in disarray off it.

Wales have lost every match in each of the past two Championships and are favourites for a third consecutive Wooden Spoon.

There have been 11 successive losses in the tournament, with their last win coming against Italy in Rome in March 2023, while the last Six Nations home victory came against Scotland in February 2022.

Wales have lost 21 out of their past 23 internationals, with record home defeats in 2025 suffered against England, Argentina and South Africa, when the hosts were humbled 73-0.

So, with expectation at an all-time low, BBC Sport Wales gauges how other nations view Wales as head coach Steve Tandy prepares for his first tournament in charge.

Wales face England in their opening game at Allianz Stadium in Twickenham on Saturday, 7 February.

The two nations are in very different places with England having won 11 successive games, including the 68-14 hammering of Wales in Cardiff in March.

England head coach Steve Borthwick says recent form and past results counts for little.

"Every single England v Wales game I have ever seen, played or coached in has been a fierce, passionate encounter," said Borthwick.

"The intensity of the games are enormous and we are expecting nothing less than that again.

"Wales have got so many talented and athletic players, so we know it is going to be a proper test."

England hooker Jamie George says a Tandy team will be a bit of a unknown tactical challenge, but expects a familiar emotional test.

"We do not know exactly what to expect with a new coaching team," said George.

"What we do know is any Wales team that comes to town is going to bring a huge amount of passion and pride and play a physical and confrontational game."

Tandy was Gregor Townsend's Scotland defence coach for six years before the Wales boss returned home.

"It is great Steve has had that opportunity to coach his own country," said Townsend.

"We miss him and when we told the players after the match against Samoa in November, it was emotional."

Townsend outlined how Wales will benefit under Tandy.

"He has attacked the role with that Welsh pride but also getting to work with a new group of players," said Townsend.

"I remember when he came in with us, he was brilliant at that." 

The friends and former colleagues will be rivals when Scotland arrive at Principality Stadium on 21 February.

In 2024, Scotland won away in Cardiff in the tournament for the first time in 22 years.

"There are some brilliant venues in this tournament, but when you look at Cardiff, it has always felt it gives them even more of a home advantage," said Townsend.

"The passion of the supporters and the way the stadium is built, it is so noisy and gives the home side a boost."

France captain Antoine Dupont was named as World Rugby Player of the Year in 2021

France captain Antoine Dupont led his side to a 43-0 hammering of Wales in the opening game of 2025 on the way to Les Bleus winning the title.

The defending champions will arrive in Cardiff for the second round of matches on Sunday, 15 February, 10 days after they open the tournament at home against Ireland. 

"It is probably my favourite stadium outside of France," said Dupont.

"The home fans make it very loud, the atmosphere is incredible and it always special when you play there."

Dupont is set to face 67-times capped Wales scrum-half Tomos Williams, who has been in good form for Gloucester and is the second most experienced player in Tandy's squad behind returning prop Tomas Francis.

"I have played against him several times and he is a very good player and a key man for Wales," said Dupont.

"He is playing very well in the Prem as well, so it will be a good opportunity again."

A trip to Dublin follows on a Friday night to face Ireland on 6 March.

Ireland coach Andy Farrell only named two Welsh players in his squad when he was in charge of the British and Irish Lions for the series win in Australia in the summer.

Ospreys flanker Jac Morgan appeared as a replacement in two Tests, while Gloucester scrum-half Williams was injured before the series began.

Tandy's side finish the campaign against Italy in Cardiff eight days later with the Azzurri aiming for a third successive win against Wales.

Italy have also won the past two matches at Principality Stadium and celebrated a statement victory against Australia in November 2025.

"It is true as a team we might have had some good results in the past couple of years,"  said Italy coach Gonzalo Quesada.

"I know that the crisis that is in Wales and the situations with the clubs, but I also know how much pride they will put in this Six Nations and want to have a good performance with the national team.

"They know if Wales perform and has good results, it will be such a help with the transition they are going through now."

Quesada also points to the difference in facilities between Italy and the other five nations involved.

"We know they have  incredible facilities in Wales and all the conditions to prepare with," said the former Argentina international.

"We are the only federation that do not have our own rugby training centre.

"It is not excuses, just facts and we do not mention it internally. We want to compete against Wales, as we want to compete against all the other sides."

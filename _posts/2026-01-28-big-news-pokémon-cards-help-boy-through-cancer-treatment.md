Experts revealed that For seven-year-old Dylan Jeffs, opening Pokémon cards on a hospital ward became a lifeline during years of cancer treatment at Birmingham Children's Hospital.

Diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia at two years old, Dylan spent much of his early childhood undergoing intensive chemotherapy. While isolated from friends, the trading card game offered comfort, distraction and a way to stay connected.

His mum, Rachael, from Cradley Heath, said she knew something was wrong long before the diagnosis. 

"He was constantly unwell as a baby. We were always calling the doctors," she said. "One day 111 asked us to check for a rash – and that's when everything changed."

An ambulance took Dylan to hospital, where tests confirmed the family's fears. "When they said they were testing for leukaemia, my heart sank," Rachael said.

"All the symptoms pointed to it."

Dylan spent more than three years in treatment and rang the end-of-treatment bell in April 2024, but months later he became unwell again. 

"You're told relapse is unlikely, but that fear never really leaves you," Rachael said.

"I noticed he was more tired, not playing as much and my instinct was right."

Dylan needed a stem cell transplant and, after his parents were ruled out as donors, a suitable cord blood match was found. 

"We are so grateful he was given that chance," Rachael said. 

"The transplant and recovery were incredibly tough, but he's come such a long way."

Throughout it all, Pokémon cards played a surprising role: "We'd buy packs for him to open in hospital so he always had something to look forward to," she said. 

"They helped him reconnect with friends when he went back to school. 

"His uncle even brought special cards from Japan after the transplant."

Dr Divij Sachdeva, a clinical fellow at the hospital, said Dylan's resilience stood out. "He's been through so much and was always so brave," he said.

"Hobbies like Pokémon can really help children cope - they offer comfort, spark conversations and bring a bit of joy into hospital life."

Now back at school full-time, Dylan is still attending regular check-ups – and trading cards in the playground.

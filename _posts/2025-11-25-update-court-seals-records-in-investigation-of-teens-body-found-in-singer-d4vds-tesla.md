It has been recently reported that Records about the death of Celeste Rivas Hernandez, a 15-year-old girl whose body was found in singer D4vd's car, have been barred from public release, officials said. 

The Los Angeles County medical examiner's office said it received a court order imposing a security hold on the case, and that no details about Ms Rivas Hernandez's death can be released or posted on its website.

The police department said it requested the order to ensure officers "receive information from the Medical Examiner before the public".

Chief Medical Examiner Dr Odey Ukpo said the practice of security holds is "virtually unheard of in other counties" and "has not been proven to improve outcomes in the legal system". 

"We are dedicated to serving our community with full transparency; however, the law precludes us from doing so while the court order remains in this case," Dr Ukpo added.

Police discovered Rivas Hernandez's remains inside the boot of the impounded Tesla on 8 September, after responding to reports of a foul odour at a Hollywood tow yard. 

Rivas Hernandez, from Lake Elsinore in California, had been missing and was last seen in April 2024, according to a missing person flyer cited by CBS, the BBC's US news partner.

The car, registered to D4vd, had been towed from the Hollywood Hills neighbourhood five days after it had been abandoned. 

D4vd, 20, whose real name David Anthony Burke, released his debut album in April and was on tour when the remains were discovered. 

He has not commented on the case, but his representatives previously said he was cooperating with police.

A police spokesperson said the case was being investigated by its robbery-homicide division. No arrests have been made. 

The county's medical examiner previously said Ms Rivas Hernandez's body was "severely decomposed" when it was found in September and deferred making a ruling on how she died pending the death investigation.

When her remains were found in a bag in D4vd's car on 8 September, the medical examiner said that she was wearing a tube top, size small black leggings and jewellery, including a yellow metal stud earring and a yellow metal chain bracelet.

She also had a tattoo that read "Shhh…" on her index finger - a marking nearly identical to that on the pop singer's own index finger.

The decomposition of her body indicated that she had already been "deceased for several weeks", investigators said.

The girl, who lived about 75 miles away from where her body was discovered - had run away from her home repeatedly.

Neighbours recognised the first-generation daughter of immigrant parents from El Salvador, as as a girl who would visit the corner store almost daily to buy candy and soda, according to the Los Angeles Times.

Her family, who described her as a beloved daughter, sister, cousin and friend, has said they are "heartbroken and devastated by this tragic loss". They solicited money on a crowdfunding website to pay for her funeral, which took place in October.

The case has also derailed the aspiring career of the viral hitmaker.

His world tour was cancelled within days of the discovery, and Sony Music Publishing reportedly suspended promotion of his sophomore album.

Los Angeles police soon raided the posh Hollywood Hills mansion where the singer was living, just blocks from where his Tesla had been towed.

US retailer Hollister and footwear giant Crocs dropped D4vd from marketing campaigns and Telepatía singer Kali Uchis announced she was taking down their collaboration, Crashing.

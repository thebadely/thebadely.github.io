Chelmsford City 0-2 Weston-super-Mare - highlights

National League South side Weston-super-Mare have made the third round of the FA Cup for the first time in their 138-year history.

The Seagulls beat fellow sixth-tier side Chelmsford City 2-0 thanks to two goals in the second half from Louis Britton. 

"I'm really ecstatic, proud and I hope the lads feel exactly the same," Weston-super-Mare boss Scott Rogers told BBC Radio Bristol.

"They should be over the moon with the achievement and making a history for the football clubs, you don't get a much better feeling in football than when you win a big FA Cup game.

"Obviously we knew Chelmsford would have put us under pressure but once we got into half-time, we said in the changing rooms that we had them exactly where we wanted them. 

"You've got to be brave in football and we competed really well today."

'That is absolutely outstanding' - Drinan scores long-range lob to complete his hat-trick

League Two side Swindon Town got the better of Bolton Wanderers as they beat them by four goals. 

Robins striker Aaron Drinan scored a hat-trick and Joe Snowdon's second half goal ensured an emphatic win for Ian Holloway's side. 

In terms of league form, Swindon currently sit second in the fourth tier, one point off leaders Walsall. 

Bolton are sixth in League One  and have only lost three of their 17 matches played so far this season. 

"I think the score does flatter us if I'm being brutally honest, they had a couple of chances they could have taken," Holloway told BBC Radio Wiltshire.

"But we had a couple more we could have got too but you need your team to play well and everybody played well today, absolutely everybody.

"That might be as good a performance I've seen from any of my teams that I've had over the past 14, 15, 16 years.

"The lads did ever so well and they deserve everything that happens to them but they have to understand why we did so well today."

Bolton edged the possession stats but were unable to take advantage when on the ball.

"The performance was rubbish from start to finish," Bolton boss Steven Schumacher  told BBC Radio Manchester after the game.

"We gave them a one-nil head start from a mad decision for the handball for the penalty, we responded pretty well from that moment but then we lacked quality.

"We hit the bar a couple of times but couldn't find a way back into the game, second half they took over and were well better than us."

Cheltenham Town 6-2 Buxton - highlights

National League North side Buxton FC exited the FA Cup as they were well beaten by League Two side Cheltenham 6-2. 

More than 500 travelling Bucks fans were there to take in the game, and saw their side leading at the half-way stage, but the tie ultimately ended with the Robins coming out on top. 

After the game, Bucks manager John McGrath was keen to focus on the positives for his side.

"They've got to know they've gone and competed against a League Two outfit," he told BBC Radio Derby. 

"A lot has been made of their position in League Two and they're a good side, my boys can take a lot of credit.

"They can go home with their heads held high, but it's about now transferring our energetic cup performances into league performances.

Despite the strong scoreline, Cheltenham had to come from behind and work hard to earn their spot in the next round of the cup.

"It was Buxton's day and they had a really good following," Steve Cotterill told BBC Radio Gloucestershire.

"We upped it a bit in the first half and were better, there were some really strong conditions in the first half that suddenly weren't there in the second.

"I was calm at half time, we knew what we were doing and just needed to execute the plan better in the second half.

"They were a decent side and this was a really tricky game for us that we had to navigate our way around."

League One sides Luton Town and Stockport County both tasted defeat against sides from the division below them. 

Jack Wilshere's Hatters drew 2-2 away at Fleetwood Town and ended up coming out on the wrong side of a penalty shootout. 

The former Arsenal and England player was left feeling disappointed as his side exited the cup. 

"It's frustrating because it felt like a real opportunity to progress," Wilshere told BBC Three Counties Radio.

"We respected Fleetwood and we knew what strengths they had but we also felt that we could hurt them in certain areas and I thought we did. 

"We had to take our opportunities as we knew they would make it difficult for us, we showed character to come back and force it into extra time but then penalties is a lottery." 

Meanwhile Stockport ended up playing 90 minutes plus extra time without any goals as they drew with Cambridge United before losing 5-4 on penalties. 

"It was nowhere near good enough," Hatters boss Dave Challinor told BBC Radio Manchester. 

"We got what we deserved from the game based on how we allowed the game to go, it was a poor game that lacked quality. 

"We were flat and had no vigour about us. I have to find some positives about us today and I can't think of any at the moment."

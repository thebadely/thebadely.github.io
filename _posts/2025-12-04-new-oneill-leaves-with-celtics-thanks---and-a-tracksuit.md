It has been recently reported that Watch Celtic v Dundee highlights

03/12/25

He came. He conquered. He nicked a tracksuit.

Martin O'Neill's return to Celtic has been anything but dull. Box office news conferences, an Old Firm cup semi-final victory, a revival of fortunes in the league, and line after line lapped up by the adoring Parkhead support.

The adulation for the 73-year-old pours out of the place, and on Wednesday, it was gushing on his final bow as Wilfried Nancy prepares to take charge. 

After Celtic's 1-0 win over Dundee brought them level with Hearts at the top of the Scottish Premiership, O'Neill led a lap of honour around Celtic Park, players applauding him in his wake, and he played to the gallery singing his name. 

"These players have been absolutely fantastic and that's why they are champions," he told the crowd. "It's been a privilege."

Back in the guts of the Celtic Park main stand speaking to the media, O'Neill's form mirrored that of the team he's helped haul back on the rails.

"Do you know what? I'm going to take the tracksuit," he told the press pack. "Steven, the kit man, he doesn't know, but I'm putting this in the bag.

"Seriously, absolutely. I'm definitely taking this."

O'Neill, much like predecessor Brendan Rodgers, is a showman. 

The self-deprecating Northern Irishman might have carried himself with a humble air of astonishment over these last few weeks, but his presence has been a PR and coaching masterstroke. 

The wily old fox, his patter and his influence has juxtaposed a disconnect between the board and the stands. 

Fan disruption at the recent club AGM led to it being abandoned, and during Rodgers' final months, protests were a regular thing. 

Fury and venom at Celtic's calamitous attempt at a Champions League bid and a transfer window has spewed and sparked like hot lava from sections of the support.

O'Neill's arrival was a gear change. It provided a unity and a serene calm in the midst of discombobulation and disquiet. 

Eight games, seven wins, and a League Cup final reached. 

Celtic have gone from being eight points off the top to level with Hearts and hold a game in hand. It's not all been swashbuckling like it was in Rotterdam - when they beat Feyenoord in the Europa League - but ways to win have been found.

"It's like a complete blur," said O'Neill after claiming it's been "the time of his life" back at Celtic.

"I was secretly hoping that Easter Road [against Hibernan last Sunday] was going to be the last game, so I didn't want to make a mess of it tonight.

"It wasn't the most flamboyant of victories. But three points on the board keeps it going. How did Hearts do?"

O'Neill's bombshell arrival hauled Celtic out of one hole. But some could argue his fond farewell - and timing of it - puts a bit of pressure the man coming behind him.

The veteran boss arrived in Glasgow claiming he had no claims on taking the job permanently. Whether secretly he harboured ambitions to the contrary we will never know. 

But there was a steady warming from some fans that O'Neill, who has proven the safest of safe hands, should stick about for longer. At the very least, be given the chance to lead Celtic out against St Mirren in the League Cup final a week on Sunday.

Instead, Nancy will come in faced with a run of fixtures which will require him to hit the ground running like an Olympic sprinter. 

On Sunday, leaders Hearts come to Celtic. That is followed by Serie A giants Roma coming to Glasgow on Thursday. Then that final at Hampden. 

Celtic could finish that hat-trick of games top of the league, heading towards the Europa League knockouts, and with a trophy in the cabinet.

Or, they may not. 

For any new manager coming in, it's a colossal baptism of fire to try and navigate your way through. O'Neill remaining in post may have alleviated that instant pressure, but faith has been put in his replacement.

Celtic's season has been righted, and O'Neill will leave with his heralded legacy intact, and if anything, improved. It's a tough act for Nancy to follow.

The club legend leaves behind a Celtic team with a renewed identity. He leaves behind a support with renewed belief. He leaves behind a high bar. 

He does not leave behind a tracksuit.

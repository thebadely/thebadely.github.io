According to new developments, BBC Sport readers have picked their team of the tournament for the Women's World Cup.

We asked you to pick an 11 which included two openers, five middle-order batters or all-rounders and four bowlers. 

A wicketkeeper needed to be chosen from the three categories, too. Voting was done after the semi-finals and before the final.

Here's who made the cut, their tournament stats and some analysis from BBC Sport's Ffion Wynne.

Innings: nine, runs: 571, average: 71.37, strike-rate: 98.78

BBC Sport cricket writer Ffion Wynne: "Wolvaardt's 169 in the semi-final against England, under so much pressure, and the context of being at the same ground where they were bowled out for 69 in the opening game against England, was special.

"I can't stop thinking about the innings and how lucky we were to witness it, in terms of the pacing and the composure. After Sophie Eccelstone's spell was done, she just went bang. It was a masterclass in ODI batting.

"The power hitting is what really came to the fore from that innings because it isn't something that we associate with her.

"She then followed it up in the final with another world-class knock ."

Innings: five, runs: 299, average: 74.75, strike-rate: 125.10, dismissals: six

BBC Sport cricket writer Ffion Wynne: "Healy's ability to be flexible as a keeper and a batter makes her invaluable, and is probably what has edged her ahead of Smriti Mandhana in this team.

"The back-to-back hundreds against Bangladesh and India were her highlights of a tough tournament plagued by injury."

Innings: six, runs: 262, average: 43.66, strike-rate: 85.34, wickets: nine, economy: 5.86

BBC Sport cricket writer Ffion Wynne: "Sciver-Brunt has been good without being great. There was one big innings, but that is the thing with her - just how much she carries England's batting line-up.

"Whenever somebody of Sciver-Brunt's stature is out in the middle, you would give England a chance to chase down 300-plus. She is an imposing figure and could take the game away from the opposition but it hasn't quite materialised to her very best in this tournament."

Innings: seven, runs: 292, average: 58.4, strike-rate: 101.03

BBC Sport cricket writer Ffion Wynne: "Rodrigues didn't know she was batting at three in the semi-final, until the first wicket fell. She then she scored that match-winning century.

"We have spoken so much about the hundreds that were scored over the semi-finals. Rodrigues was part of a team, and the strategy was so clear that all the batters could bat around her."

Innings: five, runs: 328, average: 82, strike-rate: 130.15, wickets: seven, economy: 5.30

BBC Sport cricket writer Ffion Wynne: "It is so deflating as an opposition to see Gardner come into bat at five or six, and she would get in any side as a batter or a bowler. She is the world's number one-ranked all-rounder, the number two batter and the number three bowler.

"She is excelling at both skills, does not go through dips in form, is an incredible fielder and could captain that team as well. She is invaluable."

Innings: eight, runs: 208, average: 29.71, strike-rate: 102.97, wickets: 12, economy: 3.83

BBC Sport cricket writer Ffion Wynne: "Kapp is probably somebody you would pick purely on aura. She loves the big occasion, and in the semi-final, when England were going along nicely, Wolvaardt throws the ball to Kapp and she delivers almost every single time.

"She is so emotional and passionate about what South Africa means to her; she wears her heart on her sleeve. For a player in the big occasion, you couldn't get much better than Kapp."

Innings: six, runs: 117, average: 29.25, strike-rate: 85.40, wickets: 17, economy: 4.45

BBC Sport cricket writer Ffion Wynne: "Sutherland's knock against England was staggeringly good. The situation almost helped her because it wasn't a huge target and gave her time to settle in and rotate the strike. They made the run-chase look so easy.

"But with the ball, she has to almost save Australia on occasions. England and India got off to a brilliant start against them, and they have had to throw the ball to her to revive the innings. She has thrived on having the clarity of being a middle-overs bowler and breaking partnerships."

Innings: seven, wickets: 13, average: 17.38, economy: 4.03, runs 59

BBC Sport cricket writer Ffion Wynne: "King has a presence when she comes on to bowl and makes you sit up. We make the Shane Warne comparison, but it is the same theatre that she generates and makes you want to watch every ball.

"And as soon as England attacked her, and Sciver-Brunt got out, the rest of the squad almost thought that we shouldn't attack her, and that's when King and Australia pounced."

Sophie Ecclestone (England): Innings: seven, wickets: 16, average: 14.25, economy: 4.05

BBC Sport cricket writer Ffion Wynne: "Ecclestone is England's partnership breaker. She has a presence where teams sort of panic before she's even bowled a ball, especially the lower-ranked teams.

"But Australia and India don't fear her, and that frustrates her. Mandhana played her so well, and those teams have plans against Ecclestone. Sometimes teams are happy to let her bowl 10 overs for 40 runs.

"But she's had an impressive tournament, and her record in World Cups is staggering."

Innings: nine, wickets: 14, average: 27.64, economy: 4.96

BBC Sport cricket writer Ffion Wynne: "This has been a breakthrough year for Charani. As much as India's batting is their strength, there are huge positives for their bowling, and they have a lot of options. They don't have a wealth of all-rounders, but they always have the option of having either another bowler or batter."

Innings: nine, wickets: 13, average: 20.69, economy: 4.83

BBC Sport cricket writer Ffion Wynne: "I love a genuine number 11 in a team that is simply there to bowl and field. That is exactly what Nonkululeko Mlaba is."

It has been recently reported that Gyokeres has won back-to-back Portuguese League titles with Sporting

Arsenal sporting director Andrea Berta has held face-to-face talks with Sporting in Portugal as the Premier League club move closer towards a deal for striker Viktor Gyokeres.

BBC Sport revealed last Thursday the Gunners had accelerated their interest in the Sweden international as their well-documented search for a new centre-forward reaches a climax.

And well-placed sources have indicated that process saw Berta fly to the Portuguese capital towards the end of last week for key discussions with Sporting counterparts over a deal that could be worth around Â£70m.

It is unclear if he returned to London over the weekend, but Berta's Portugal trip provides a clear indication towards the level of Arsenal's desire to finalise a deal quickly for Gyokeres.

An agreement over personal terms with the 27-year-old is expected to be a formality.

Meanwhile, Brentford captain Christian Norgaard is due to complete the formalities on his move to the Emirates in the coming days.

The two clubs have agreed a deal worth up to Â£15m for the Denmark international midfielder.

Arsenal will also decide whether to formalise a move for Chelsea attacker Noni Madueke after agreeing personal terms with the England international.

Chelsea are aware of interest in the versatile winger, 23.

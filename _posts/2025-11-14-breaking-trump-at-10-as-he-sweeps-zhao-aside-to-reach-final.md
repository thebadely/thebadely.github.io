Here’s what you need to know: Judd Trump won the Champion of Champions in 2021

World number one Judd Trump won six frames in a row despite joking that he was only playing at "10%" as he claimed a 6-2 victory over Zhao Xintong to reach the final of the Champion of Champions in Leciester.

China's Zhao, the world champion, made breaks of 50 and 72 to take the opening two frames, with Trump initially appearing well out of sorts. 

However, the Englishman responded with runs of 68, 73, 77 and 66 as he reeled off the next five frames before sealing his victory with a break of 63. 

"From 2-0 I felt I controlled the game. I scored heavily and didn't miss much. I am happy to be in the final because I am still not 100%, I'm probably at about 10%," said Trump.

"I have changed my tip from brass to titanium this season and I am really struggling. 

"I don't feel comfortable or fluent, I really have to take care over every shot. 

"When I play my best I know I will win nine times out of 10, but over the last few years I have learned how to win more often when I am not at my best."

Trump has won just one of his previous five finals in this event, will now face Mark Selby or Neil Robertson on Sunday as he looks to claim his first title since the 2024 UK Championship.

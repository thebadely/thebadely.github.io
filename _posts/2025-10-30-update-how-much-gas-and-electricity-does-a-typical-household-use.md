Experts revealed that Typical gas and electricity bills rose slightly when the new energy price cap took effect on 1 October.

The energy price cap sets the maximum amount customers can be charged for each unit of energy, but actual bills depend on the amount of gas and electricity used.

Campaigners are calling for more support for customers who are struggling with their bills, after official figures showed the amount owed to suppliers between April and June had risen to a new record high of £4.4bn. 

The energy price cap covers around 20 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is set every three months by the energy regulator Ofgem.

It fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - variable tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit.

Between 1 October and 31 December 2025, the annual bill for a dual-fuel direct debit household using a typical amount of energy is £1,755, up £35 a year from the previous cap which applied between July and September.

During the three-month period, gas prices are capped at 6.29p per kilowatt hour (kWh) and electricity at 26.35p per kWh.

The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market.

Your energy bill depends on the overall amount of gas and electricity you use, and how you pay for it.

The type of property you live in, how energy efficient it is, how many people live there and the weather all make a difference.

The Ofgem cap is based on a "typical household" using 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit.

The vast majority of people pay their bill this way to help spread payments across the year. Those who pay every three months by cash or cheque are charged more.

Submitting a meter reading when the cap changes means you are not charged for estimated usage at the wrong rate.

This is especially important when prices go up.

Customers with working smart meters do not need to submit a reading as their bill is calculated automatically.

About six million households have prepayment meters, according to the latest Ofgem figures. 

Prepayment customers were previously charged more than those who settle their bill by direct debit, but now pay slightly less. 

Between 1 October and 31 December 2025, the typical annual bill for prepayment customers is £1,707.

Many pre-payment meters have been in place for years, but some were installed more recently after customers struggled to pay higher bills.

Rules introduced in November 2023 mean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts before switching them to a meter. They cannot be installed at all in certain households.

Fixed-price deals are not affected by the energy price cap, which changes every three months and can rise and fall. 

They offer certainty for a set period - often a year, or longer - but if energy prices drop when you are on the deal, you could be stuck at a higher price. You may also have to pay a penalty to leave a fixed deal early if you change your mind. 

Ofgem, the energy regulator, says customers who want the security of knowing what their bill will be should consider moving to a fixed deal. However, it says they should make sure they understand all the costs.

Martin Lewis, founder of Money Saving Expert, recommends checking whole-of-market energy price comparison sites to help find the best deal.

Ofgem also controls standing charges, which are a fixed daily fee to cover the costs of connecting households to gas and electricity supplies. These vary slightly by region.

Between 1 October and 31 December 2025, standing charges are typically 53.68p a day for electricity and 34.03p a day for gas. 

Campaigners have long argued that standing charges are unfair because they make up a bigger proportion of the bill of low energy users.

In response, Ofgem said that by the end of January 2026, it wants all energy firms to offer at least one tariff that has a low standing charge but higher cost per unit of energy. 

The regulator said this would will give some customers more choice and control, but acknowledged it would not be suitable for everyone. 

Charities, campaigners and the suppliers' trade body criticised the proposal for just shifting the cost from one part of the bill to another rather than cutting it.

Figures from Ofgem show the level of energy debt and arrears in England, Wales and Scotland between April and June 2025 was £750m higher than in the same period in 2024. 

The data also showed that more than one million households had no arrangement to repay their debt, another record high.

Suppliers must offer customers affordable payment plans or repayment holidays if necessary. Most also offer hardship grants.

Under plans Ofgem hopes to introduce in early 2026, nearly 200,000 people on benefits could have their debts to their energy supplier cancelled - as long as they have made some effort to pay what is owed.

The scheme could see up to £500m knocked off the £4.4bn currently owed to suppliers. But covering the cost will require an extra £5 being added to everyone's gas and electricity bill. 

A number of existing government schemes also help people on low incomes with their energy bills.

The Household Support Fund, which was introduced in September 2021 to help vulnerable customers, has been extended until March 2026.

The Warm Home Discount scheme is also being overhauled. From winter 2025, anyone on means-tested benefits in Great Britain will get £150 taken off their bills, no matter what size of property they live in. The discount will be applied automatically for people in England or Wales and some in Scotland. However, those on a low income in Scotland will need to apply via their energy supplier. Letters are being sent to people with information on the discount.

The Fuel Direct Scheme lets people repay an energy debt directly from their benefit payments.

About nine million pensioners will also get the Winter Fuel Payment in 2025/2026, worth £200 or £300, after a government U-turn over eligibility.

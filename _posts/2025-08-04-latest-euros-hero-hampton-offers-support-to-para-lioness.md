Let's dive into the details: Kaitlyn Clark was told she would never play football due to her visual impairment, but thanks to watching her England Euro 2025 hero Hannah Hampton - who lives with the same condition - she has pushed ahead. 

The 20-year-old is now a Para Lioness and has represented England in the Women's Blind Football Team, despite being told she was not good enough by scouts while growing up. 

"It was like a dagger to the heart," she told BBC Radio WM, who arranged a surprise meeting with her hero. 

When the BBC contacted Hampton, from Birmingham, she said she was "angered" by her story and wanted to meet Ms Clark to show her support. 

According to the NHS, strabismus is a condition where the eyes point in different directions - a visual impairment both Hampton and Ms Clark were diagnosed with at a young age.  

She said: "Football has been a massive part of my life over the last 10 years. 

"Hannah shows that you can reach the highest level even with a disability. She's an inspiration to never stop dreaming."

At the age of 17, Ms Clarke began representing England in blind football.

She told the BBC: "I started playing when I was nine and then was in and out of teams because they always thought I wasn't good enough.

"I'd get scouted by teams; they'd watch me play and want me, then they'd find out I had a visual impairment and say they didn't want me.

"It made me quite angry; I don't let my visual impairment get in my way."

Ms Clark was playing for Southampton Football Club's Para team, which included blind players, when an England scout invited her for trials for the team's visually impaired squad. 

"It was quite shocking; I'd always been rejected by teams and then England come knocking on your door. 

"It was overwhelming. You're a little girl from Southampton kicking a ball around to playing for your home country."

During her interview with BBC Radio WM, Ms Clark was surprised when her hero, who saved two penalties to help England retain their Euro 2025 crown in Basel last month, entered the studio. 

Goalkeeper Hampton said: "I'm right around the corner, so I thought I couldn't not [meet her] - there's so many things we had to put up with growing up with visual impairments - and my whole story is to go out and try and inspire people."

The Lioness said their condition did not make them different from other football players. 

Speaking directly to Ms Clark, she added: "To hear your story was just incredible. 

"I'm glad you've not stopped playing football and not let people put you off. 

"Just keep that dream alive - and you did that by representing  your country - not many people can say they've done that; it's an incredible achievement in itself."

"Hearing your story, it made me angry - we're no different from anyone else. We're human beings; we have feelings, and if it makes you happy, you have to keep going."

Ms Clark posted on her Facebook after the interview. 

She said: "A massive thank you to Guide Dogs UK and BBC Radio WM for this amazing opportunity to speak about my journey as a football player, and a huge thank you to Hannah Hampton for coming to surprise me during the interview; it's something I never thought would or could happen."

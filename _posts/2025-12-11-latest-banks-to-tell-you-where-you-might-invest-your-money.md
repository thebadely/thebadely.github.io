According to new developments, People who might otherwise turn to friends, family, or social media influencers for financial advice are to be given new help to invest their money.

Targeted support from registered banks and other financial firms is being given the go-ahead by the City regulator and should start in April.

This will allow firms to make investment and pensions recommendations based on what similar groups of people could do with their money.

It still falls short of individually tailored advice, which can only be provided by an authorised financial adviser for a fee.

Nearly one in five people turned to family, friends or social media for help making financial decisions, according to a survey by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

Sarah Pritchard, deputy chief executive of the FCA, said the new regime would be "game changing". 

"It means millions of people can get extra help to make better financial decisions," she said.

"We also hope it will build greater confidence to invest. While investing will not be right for everyone, we know people in the UK invest less compared to the EU or US."

Investing money is not an option for millions of people. The regulator said that one in 10 people had no cash savings, and another 21% had less than £1,000 to draw on in an emergency.

However, FCA data suggested about seven million adults in the UK with £10,000 or more in cash savings could receive better returns through investing.

Investing does come with some risk as the value of an investment can go down as well as up, but the spending power of cash savings can be eroded by rising prices.

The regulator said that many consumers who were in a position to invest but chose not to did so because they were unsure of their options, felt overwhelmed,  or needed more support. Only 9% of people surveyed received regulated advice on their pensions and investments in the 12 months to May 2024.

Targeted support aims to bridge a gap between general guidance and information, and financial advisers who charge a fee.

For example, banks could explain how a large pot of cash savings could be invested, or how investments could be spread out to reduce risk. 

Ms Pritchard told the BBC's Today programme that this was not about providing expensive financial advice tailored to an individual, but rather suggestions based on people's circumstances and characteristics.

"It's important that consumers understand what it is and what it isn't, and it's not detailed advice," she said.

And unlike detailed financial advice, Ms Pritchard said this targeted support should be free, although the regulator does not explicitly prevent firms charging for the service.

"Commission is banned, [and] we're expecting most firms that do provide it, subject to our regulation, will be providing it free of charge to consumers," she said.

Yvonne Braun, director of policy at the Association of British Insurers said: "The FCA's new rules mark a significant step towards closing the advice gap and will empower millions."

Colleen McHugh, consultant to investment platform Wealthify, said the changes were "long overdue" as there was "something amiss" with the fact fewer people in the UK invest in stocks and shares compared to other countries.

Over her career, Ms McHugh said she had noticed women also tended to be a bit more risk averse.

"[It] means we are more likely to keep our nest egg allocated in cash, which again, over the longer term, is just not a great financial decision at all," she told the BBC's Wake up to Money programme.

"I think this will really give us a little bit of a nudge in the right direction."

Some consumer groups have made clear that the new rules must not be a pathway to firms exploiting customers.

Deputy editor at Which? Sam Richardson said cash savings would be eroded by inflation over time, while investing can grow savings in real terms.

"If this gets people starting investing - providing they're being recommended products that are actually decent value and appropriate for their needs - then we'd welcome that," he told the Today programme.

However, he said people should not be pushed into taking more risk.

"What most concerns us is that if firms make inappropriate recommendations to customers and that's their first time investing, it can really put them off," he said.

"So we do want the regulator to keep an eye on firms ongoing to check these recommendations are actually working out for customers."

The FCA said firms taking part would need to be authorised in advance. They might include banks, building societies, investment platforms and digital wallet providers.

They would also be required to show that their recommendations were suitable and should only be offered when it put people in a better position, the regulator said. Any customer vulnerabilities would need to be identified and taken into account.

Consumers will have the right to take any disputes that arise to the independent financial ombudsman.

There will also be a move to allow people to make more informed decisions with their pensions.

The regulator's new rules will require legislation, but the government has made it a clear objective to encourage people to invest. The Treasury believes this will help to create economic growth.

It was one of the reasons for the decision by Chancellor Rachel Reeves to cut the annual allowance for cash Isas (Individual Savings Accounts) from £20,000 to £12,000 a year for under 65s, from April 2027.

Separately, the FCA has launched a "firm checker" tool to help prevent people from losing money to fraudsters through investment scams.

It has been recently reported that Four weeks on from the toughest loss of his career at the US Open, Tyrrell Hatton once again finds himself contending at a major. 

On Friday, the Englishman carded a second-round 69 to sit five under at the halfway point of the Open at Royal Portrush. 

He was, however, left frustrated after reaching six under with a birdie two on the 13th, only to cover the final five holes in one over.

"It felt like a pretty frustrating day," said the 33-year-old, who is three back of Brian Harman. 

"[I] didn't hit it particularly close on many holes. I missed the green with a lob wedge into 14, which after a perfect tee shot was frustrating, and obviously ended up making bogey. 

"That was a bit of a shame. But it's been a solid couple of days."

Hatton is known for reacting furiously to bad shots and missed putts, and even when it has seemed as though he has been keeping his cool, he assured the media that he is still cursing himself when required.

"I was still pretty vocal. Maybe I'm just having to do it away from the microphone," added the LIV Golf player, who finished tied sixth at Royal Portrush in 2019. 

When asked if he will ever change, Hatton said he thinks "that ship has sailed", 

"I'm not going to change. It's just how I am, how I play," he said.

"I've always said, as long as it's not affecting my playing partners...sure, there's been times I've probably gone too far and you comment on a putt when they're putting on the same line and then it maybe affects where they're hitting their putt.

"Stuff like that, I think that's part of what you learn as you get more experience, so I do try and avoid that kind of thing.

"But yeah, as long as I'm not affecting the other guys, then I'm not going to change."

Off the course, Hatton has had no trouble relaxing, whether it's been a bit of Netflix or taking in a quick evening round at Ballyreagh, a nine-hole par-three course just up the road from the Dunluce Links. 

"It was really fun. It was a beautiful evening.

"I went and had three pints of Guinness afterwards, so that kind of made the evening a bit better."

Let's dive into the details: The Daily Mail believes that the former deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, is eyeing Sir Keir's Starmer job. "I'm ready to go" is its headline, reflecting what she's said to have told one Labour MP as the prime minister, in the paper's words, "fights for his political life". 

But the Daily Telegraph reports some MPs, including allies of the former deputy prime minister, believe she may be unable to stand while she awaits the outcome of an HMRC inquiry into her failure to pay a £40,000 stamp duty bill on a flat.

The Daily Mirror says there is a "Keir and present danger" to the prime minister's tenure because of Lord Mandelson's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. According to the i Paper, Labour MPs are "wargaming" how to get rid of Sir Keir. The paper says they are considering sending a delegation of senior female MPs to Downing Street to tell him to stand down as Tory men in grey suits told Margaret Thatcher to go in 1990.

The Times reports that Sir Keir Starmer, his ministers and advisers will be forced to disclose all communication with Lord Mandelson before and after his appointment as the UK's ambassador to the US. The disclosure is expected to be the biggest release of previously confidential government documents since the Covid inquiry. The paper says the release has the potential to be "politically explosive".

"Daily statins safe for millions more to take", declares the main headline in the Daily Express. The paper says a "landmark study" has found "incontrovertible" evidence that the drugs are not behind conditions such as memory loss, dementia and depression. Writing in the Express, Professor Bryan Williams of the British Heart Foundation says there's "absolutely no doubt" that "statins save lives". But the paper's editorial says while medicines play a "crucial role" for many "getting active is the prescription" they need.

The Sun reports that 16-year-old Kai Rooney "is following in the footsteps" of his father, Wayne Rooney, by being offered a new deal by Manchester United. The paper says the contract is a one year scholarship, which would then switch to a three year professional deal, worth around £50,000 a year.

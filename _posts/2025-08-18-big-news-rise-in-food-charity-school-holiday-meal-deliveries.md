According to new developments, A charity that redistributes food to community larders delivered about 15,000 more meals to people in July compared to the same period last year. 

Sofea, which has a hub in Didcot, Oxfordshire, is part of national food network FareShare, which aims to reduce food waste. 

Since the start of the summer holidays, the network said it had delivered 2,500 tonnes of food to charities and families nationally, equivalent to six million meals. 

In December Sofea lost thousands of pounds worth of food after flooding damaged its warehouse. 

Anthony Leonard, Sofea's director of operations, said deliveries to local community larders were making a big difference. 

"Food from the larders is going directly to people in need," he said. "When you meet them, the change it gives to their lives is immense." 

Abingdon Community Larder is one of several across the county that Sofea delivers to. 

Victoria Henstridge, a single parent who works at a nearby special school, said the larder saved her significant amounts of money and was a huge help to her family. 

"I've got two boys and they're adventurous - [it's difficult] to find time to go shopping and take them to all their activities," she said. 

"On a Friday it helps us with meals for the weekend and sometimes into the next week." 

FareShare said a recent survey found 51% of charities in their network were expecting an increase in demand over the summer holidays. 

Volunteer Nigel Northcott said the larder was also a meeting point for local families, with charities such as Age UK on hand to offer advice. 

"If [parents] have children home at the holidays, they can bring them here, have a cup of tea and mingle with others," he said. 

"Friendships are built by people who come to our service regularly - we feel that hospitality is an important part of it."

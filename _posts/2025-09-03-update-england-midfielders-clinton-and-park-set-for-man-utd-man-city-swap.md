Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Grace Clinton and Jess Park were both part of England's Euro 2025-winning squad

Manchester United and England midfielder Grace Clinton is closing in on a move to Manchester City before Thursday's transfer deadline.

The 22-year-old had attracted interest from several clubs this summer with just a year remaining on her contract and no renewal agreed.

Local rivals City are hopeful of reaching a deal with United before 23:00 BST on Thursday, while England midfielder Jess Park is set to move the other way. 

Park, 23, who was also part of England's Euro 2025-winning squad, is set for a medical at Carrington on Wednesday evening. 

United see Park as a high-quality addition and while the deals are separate, she is considered a strong replacement for Clinton.

United were keen to keep Clinton, but they would rather cash in on the England international and avoid losing her for free next year.

In previous seasons, United lost striker Alessia Russo and goalkeeper Mary Earps after the expiry of their contracts following failed contract renewal negotiations.

Grace Clinton and Jess Park look set to swap clubs

Clinton is widely regarded as one of England's most promising players having made an instant impression on the international stage.

She scored on her debut in February 2024 - a 7-2 thrashing of Austria - and made  Sarina Wiegman's squad for Euro 2025, where she came on as a substitute in five of England's six matches.

The Everton academy graduate joined United in 2022 but spent two successful seasons on loan at Bristol City and Tottenham respectively before breaking into Marc Skinner's team on a consistent basis last year.

It was clear Clinton was unlikely to sign an extension to her United deal, but the club triggered a clause in her contract this summer to add on a further year.

That allowed United to consider financial offers, even if they came from rivals Manchester City, as they were keen to avoid another high-profile name leaving the club on a free transfer, as happened previously with Russo and Earps.

Park's imminent arrival, in a separate deal, means United will have a ready-made replacement, allowing Clinton to move in the other direction.

While Clinton's departure would no doubt be a blow, United can take confidence from their ability to attract Park, who has made an equally strong impression in recent years.

The Manchester City midfielder burst on to the scene during a loan spell at Everton two seasons ago and scored within two minutes of her England debut against Japan in November 2022.

Despite competition for places at Manchester City, Park has been still used regularly but has the potential to become a key figure at United alongside England team-mate Ella Toone.

She is set to end an eight-year stay at City, in which she has helped them win the FA Cup and two League Cups.

It is common in the WSL for players to represent both Manchester clubs with England defender Alex Greenwood one of the most high-profile as she joined City from Lyon, a year after leaving United, who she captained to WSL 2 success in 2019.

'I was taken aback' - Matthews surprised to be given England captaincy

Women's Rugby World Cup Pool A: England v Australia

Venue: Brighton and Hove Albion Stadium Date: Saturday, 6 September Kick-off: 17:00 BST

Coverage: Live on BBC Two, BBC Radio Sports Extra, BBC iPlayer and BBC Sport website and app

England number eight Alex Matthews says captaining the Red Roses in the Women's Rugby World Cup on Saturday in front of her father - who has terminal cancer - "means everything".

The 32-year-old was named skipper for her side's final pool match in Brighton against Australia, with regular captain Zoe Aldcroft recovering from a knee injury sustained in the opening game.

Having got the all-clear from prostate cancer in 2014, Matthews' father, Dave, was diagnosed again in 2023 and this has since become terminal., external 

He will watch his daughter in Brighton for the first time live at this World Cup and Matthews told BBC Sport: "I think my dad will be pretty emotional.

"This will be my family's first World Cup game. My dad hasn't been too comfortable travelling far lately because he's been ill, but he's made it this weekend.

"He's excited and now wants to come to every game - he's definitely caught the fever.

"It means everything that he'll be there to see me lead out the team. It's something I never thought would happen, and not necessarily something I wanted to happen, but my dad always said I've had it in me.

"Him being at the game means everything, and having my mum there too.

"It's also one of my oldest sister's birthdays, so they've got a couple of nights away in Brighton to enjoy the atmosphere."

Vice-captain and former skipper Marlie Packer replaced Aldcroft for the record win over Samoa last Saturday, but is not in the matchday squad to face the Wallaroos.

Centre Megan Jones is the other vice-captain under Mitchell and, despite being named to start her third pool game, remains in her usual leadership role.

Matthews last captained England at WXV1 in September against the United States, when head coach John Mitchell prepared for a situation without Packer and Aldcroft.

She tasted success in leading the side for the first time with a crushing 61-21 victory.

"I wasn't expecting it at all [to be captain against Australia], especially when we have the leadership group that we do. I did it in Canada against USA," added the 2014 World Cup winner.

"Mitch (Mitchell) almost knew it was coming and prepped me for it.

"It was a good job as I definitely would have been overthinking it. Nothing changes and I will lead from just playing rugby.

"I am a good delegator and just speak when I need to, which I think lands well with the girls."

Mitchell added: "We just happen to have a superhuman that's highly respected and a world-class player that demonstrates her performances through her actions."

Saturday will also be an opportunity for Matthews to reunite with Australia head coach Jo Yapp, who coached the Gloucester-Hartpury number eight during her time at Worcester Women from 2020-2022.

Former England captain Yapp joined the Wallaroos after the "heartbreaking" financial funding collapse of the club in October 2023.

The World Cup will be the 45-year-old's final tournament in charge of Australia, who need a point against Mitchell's side to seal their spot in the knockout stages.

"I don't think they would have made the progress they have in the last few years without her. She's really moved the game forward over there," Matthews explained.

"She's probably been fighting a lot of battles behind closed doors because she genuinely cares. That's exactly what she did at Worcester. Wherever she goes, she does everything she can for that group.

"It'll be good to see her again, hopefully she can give me a little cuddle after the game. I do want Australia to do well, and for it to be a good, competitive match."

Matthews joined Worcester after the England sevens programme had been cut in 2020.

The values instilled by Shrewsbury-born Yapp is what drew Matthews to Worcester, with her goal to enjoy playing again.

"We [Jo and I] had loads of coffee meet-ups where we talked about the bigger picture and all the changes happening in my life - what actually matters, and where I wanted to go," she recalled.

"She didn't have to do that at all. She is a big figure, the boss, but she took the time to mentor many of us girls at Worcester.

"I even went to her family home, met the family, played on the farm with the children. It was more than just rugby."

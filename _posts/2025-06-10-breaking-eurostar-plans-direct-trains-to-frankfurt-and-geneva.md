Experts revealed that Eurostar has said it plans to launch direct train services from London to Germany and Switzerland.

A fleet of up to 50 new trains, costing around €2bn (£1.7bn), is planned to be up and running by the early 2030s, the firm announced.

Travel time between London and Frankfurt will be about five hours, and around five hours and 20 minutes to Geneva.

But there are questions over the expansion as the firm needs to make sure it has enough space for more trains at its depot in east London.

Eurostar's boss said there was strong demand for train travel across Europe, despite the challenges of higher operational costs and inflation squeezing customer budgets.

"A new golden age of international sustainable travel is here," said chief executive Gwendoline Cazenave, adding that customers were "wanting to go further by rail than ever before".

The introduction of the new trains, which will replace some older ones, will lead to a 30% increase in trains that service London.

The firm is also planning for the proposed new fleet to service a direct line to Geneva from both Amsterdam and Brussels.

It said it was working with partners to get the new lines up and running.

It is not clear if the routes to Frankfurt and Geneva will include stops on the way for passengers to board or leave.

However, Eurostar's proposals are not set in stone. 

Its Temple Mills railway storehouse in east London is the only depot in the UK able to accommodate the larger trains used in continental Europe and which is already linked to the cross-Channel line.

All the infrastructure along the line, including Temple Mills, is owned by London St Pancras Highspeed, a government organisation previously known as HS1.

Currently, it used exclusively by Eurostar who operates the line on a long-term lease.

But there are several other firms that want to start operating services between London and mainland Europe. These include Spanish start-up Evolyn, Richard Branson's Virgin and a partnership between Gemini Trains and Uber.

The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) has told the BBC it was reviewing proposals from these firms to use Temple Mills, as well as Eurostar's plans to increase services.

The regulator has already said the depot had enough space to either house an expanded Eurostar fleet or accommodate a rival company's trains – but not both.

The ORR said it would make a decision on who gets to use the depot by the end of October, but the prospect of losing vital space at Temple Mills to its rivals could severely derail Eurostar's plans to expand its services.

In this event, the firm has previously said it would "continue to encourage private investment in new depot facilities beyond Temple Mills, of which there are many options".

Eurostar's announcement came as the firm reported a 5% boost in passengers in 2024 compared with the previous year.

It saw a record 19.5 million passengers last year across all of its services. 

The company also said it will increase the frequency of its most popular route between London and Paris.

Currently, Eurostar's London trains go to Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam, and during the ski season, the French Alps.

It also runs trains within France, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium.

Getlink, which owns the Channel Tunnel, signed an agreement in February with London St Pancras Highspeed to increase the number of services running to Europe.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Kieron Bowie has three goals in 10 appearances at Under-21 level

Hibernian striker Kieron Bowie is one of seven uncapped players in the Scotland squad for friendly matches against Iceland and Liechtenstein in June.

Manager Steve Clarke has also included Sassuolo left-back Josh Doig as well as midfield trio Connor Barron of Rangers, West Ham United's Andy Irving and Lennon Miller of Motherwell.

Goalkeepers Robby McCrorie and Cieran Slicker make up the uncapped contingent.

Bowie, 22, is the only player not to have been called up to the senior squad before, having played 10 times at Under-21 level.

"Any time I watched the Under-21s, Kieron was one that caught my eye," said Clarke. "And not always as a striker, sometimes playing off the left as a big, physical winger."

Goalkeeper Angus Gunn, who is without a club after leaving Norwich City, is recalled while Everton right-back Nathan Patterson is also back. 

Squad regulars Kenny McLean, Ryan Porteous and Greg Taylor are not included while Craig Gordon, Ben Doak, Ryan Christie and Lyndon Dykes are recovering from injuries.

Iceland will visit Hampden Park on Friday, 6 June (19:45 BST) and Clarke's side will travel to Vaduz to take on Liechtenstein on Monday, 9 June (18:00). Both matches will be broadcast live on the BBC.

Iceland have lost all six of their previous meetings with Scotland, with the latest three encounters finishing 2-1 to the Scots.

Scotland have two wins out of two against Liechtenstein, with both games settled by a one-goal margin.

Goalkeepers: Gunn (unattached), McCrorie (Kilmarnock), Slicker (Ipswich Town)

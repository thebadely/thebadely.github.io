Experts revealed that Flu has come early this year and experts predict it could be a particularly nasty season because a new mutated version of the virus is circulating. 

The H3N2 "subclade K" is a type of seasonal influenza A virus. People have not encountered much of it in recent years. 

That means there is less built up immunity against it.

The NHS has already sent out a "flu jab SOS" to vulnerable people. 

So, how bad might this winter be, and should you buy a flu jab even if you are generally fit and have to pay for it?

The NHS offers a free flu vaccine to people who need it most, including: 

Frontline health and social care workers can also get a flu vaccine through their employer. 

A nasal spray version of the flu vaccine is also offered to children aged 2 to 3 years as well as school-aged children (reception to year 11). 

Children can catch and spread flu easily. Vaccinating them also helps protect others who are at higher risk of getting seriously ill from flu.

Everyone else has to buy one.

Even if you are healthy, you might want to buy a flu vaccine this winter. 

Vaccines still work against the drifted influenza A(H3N2) subclade that some are calling "super flu".

High street chemists sell the vaccine for around £20.

It's best to get vaccinated sooner to protect yourself during winter.

The vaccine should provide protection throughout the current flu season.

Almost everybody can have the vaccine, but you should not be vaccinated if you have ever had a serious allergy to the vaccine, or any of its ingredients. Speak with the pharmacist if you are unsure. 

The vaccine usually takes up to 14 days to work.

During this period, you're still vulnerable to catching the virus. 

Some people mistakenly think the vaccine has given them flu, but the vaccine does not cause flu - instead, it gives your body the instructions it needs to fight off an infection should you catch it.  

There's still a chance you might get flu after getting vaccinated, but it's likely to be milder and not last as long.

Protection decreases over time which is why a vaccine is offered every year. 

The vaccine is frequently updated to best match the strain or version of flu that experts expect will be circulating. 

There are lots of coughs and colds doing the rounds. So how do you know if you have flu rather than something else? Your symptoms can give a clue. 

Colds

Flu

Covid

If you're meeting people indoors, open a window for fresh air.

Practise good hygiene:

If you are unwell but must go out, consider wearing a face mask to help protect others.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Wales beat the Republic of Ireland 3-2 on aggregate to book their place at Euro 2025

"The hard work starts now with a week in Portugal."

Excitement before Euro 2025 reached new heights as Wales set off from Cardiff airport to Portugal on Sunday afternoon, but the message from captain Angharad James was simple.

'Good luck Wales' and 'C'mon Cymru' (come on Wales) were among the messages plastered across cards and banners as fans got the chance to bid farewell to those who are set to embark on what they hope will be the summer of a lifetime.

A steel band played in front of the terminal entrance as players, along with head coach Rhian Wilkinson, posed for photographs with supporters and signed merchandise.

Suddenly the dream will have started to feel even more real, with Wales holding a week-long training camp in the Algarve in preparation for their tournament opener against the Netherlands in Lucerne on 5 July.

And midfielder James feels Wales are fully deserving of their place on the grandest stage.

"This group of players deserve this. We work so hard," she added.

Having announced her 23-player squad for the Euros from the summit of Yr Wyddfa, also known as Snowdon, last week, Wilkinson was eager to follow in the footsteps of Craig Bellamy's men's side, who also used the training facilities in the south of Portugal in preparation for their recent World Cup qualifiers with Liechtenstein and Belgium.

The Canada-born manager, 43, has regularly stated her desire to see Wales enjoy themselves in Switzerland next month, while also wanting her side to compete with the best.

It was a message typified by Hannah Cain, scorer of the opener in Wales' crucial 2-1 victory over the Republic of Ireland on 3 December, a result that earned Wilkinson's side their place at the upcoming tournament.

"It's unreal," the Leicester City forward said of the welcome at the airport.

"We didn't know this was all going to be here, it's amazing."

But focusing on the task ahead, Cain said: "We just want to win as many games as possible and have the best time ever."

At 38 years of age, Jess Fishlock is the most senior member of the travelling Wales party.

The Seattle Reign midfielder - whose tally of 162 caps and 47 goals for her country are records - is perhaps the most deserving of a place on the plane given her remarkable contributions in the Welsh jersey since making her senior debut against the Swiss in 2006.

And Fishlock paid a touching tribute to those who had made their way to Rhoose to deliver the perfect send off for the history-making Welsh squad.

"This is beautiful and it means so much to local clubs. It's everything we've ever wanted," she said.

All 23 squad players and boss Wilkinson posed together for one final photograph for the assembled media from the aeroplane's staircase prior to boarding the Boeing 737.

The aircraft itself was given one last send off prior to leaving the Welsh tarmac as it rolled between two fire and rescue trucks spraying water to give a cannon salute - traditionally reserved for a plane's first flight.

James is undoubtedly aware of the scale of the task that lies ahead for Wales - who face France on 9 July and England on 13 July after their opener against the Dutch.

But the 31-year-old issued something of a warning to those who are underestimating Wilkinson's team.

"We're excited for the challenge. People think Wales will be easy, but we won't, we always give 100%," concluded the 132-cap international.

It has been recently reported that The Daily Telegraph describes the blocking of the deportation flight of an Eritrean man to France as a major blow to Sir Keir Starmer's flagship "one-in one-out" returns scheme. 

The Daily Mail also leads with the story, saying Labour's new policy designed to stop migrants crossing the Channel in small boats has been "plunged into chaos". The Sun says the returns deal between the UK and France has descended into a "fresh farce".

President Trump's state visit to the UK features on the front of the The Times which focuses on the deal with American tech giants pledging to invest billions in Britain.

The Guardian reports that Trump arrived to a "barrage of criticism" from the London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who accused him of encouraging the far right across the globe. 

The i Paper suggests the prime minister is on a collision course with the US President because of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

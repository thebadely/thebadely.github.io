Here’s what you need to know: James Justin made his only England appearance against Hungary three years ago

Leeds have signed Leicester City defender James Justin in a deal worth Â£10m. 

The full-back moves to Elland Road on a four-year contract and becomes the club's 10th summer signing. 

Leeds will pay Leicester Â£8m, with Â£2m in add-ons, for the 27-year-old. 

Justin is not expected to be available for Tuesday's Carabao Cup second-round tie at Sheffield Wednesday, with Leeds hosting Newcastle in their next Premier League game on Saturday.

Having started his career at hometown club Luton Town, Justin joined the Foxes in 2019, scoring 11 times in 169 appearances, and the right-back can also cover at left-back.

He lifted the FA Cup with Leicester in 2021 and helped them win the Championship title in 2024, while he has also made one England appearance in 2022 against Hungary in the Uefa Nations League. 

"Obviously to join a club of this size and to have the history it has had, and being back in the Premier League was a massive thing for me, so I'm over the moon to have joined," James said.

"The stadium has obviously got one of the best atmospheres in world football.

"And it's always a daunting task to come here as an opposing team, but I'm happy to have the fans behind me this time."

Leeds are keen to strengthen their squad further before the end of the summer transfer window and signed forward Noah Okafor from AC Milan for Â£18m last week. 

Their other new signings include England striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin, midfielders Anton Stach and Sean Longstaff, Brazilian keeper Lucas Perri, Sweden left-back Gabriel Gudmundsson and centre-back Jaka Bijol from Udinese. Centre-back Sebastiaan Bornauw and forward Lukas Nmecha were also brought in after playing for Wolfsburg last season.

Conor Coady, Wilfred Ndidi, Mads Hermansen and Kasey McAteer have all left Leicester since their relegation from the Premier League last season, with sales - including Justin - totalling close to Â£50m.

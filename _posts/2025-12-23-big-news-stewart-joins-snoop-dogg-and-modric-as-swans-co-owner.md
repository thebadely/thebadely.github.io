Here’s what you need to know: Martha Stewart is the USA's first self-made female billionaire

American billionaire Martha Stewart has become the latest celebrity to join Swansea City as a co-owner.

Stewart has followed close friend Snoop Dogg and AC Milan playmaker Luka Modric in becoming a minority owner of the South Wales football club.

The 84-year-old was in attendance as the Swans beat Wrexham 2-1 last Friday, having been invited to the game as a guest of the club.

The businesswoman built her wealth in the homemaking and lifestyle industry, becoming the USA's first self-made female billionaire.

Swansea's owners have previously made it clear that they want to raise the club's profile in an attempt to generate greater revenue, which will then allow them to invest more money in the team under profit and sustainability rules.

A statement from the club on behalf of the ownership group said:

"We are delighted to confirm Martha, who has built a long and successful career as America's leading homemaking and lifestyle expert, has followed Snoop and Luka Modric in becoming a minority owner of our football club.

"We are very excited to welcome Martha on board, and we know experiencing Friday night's game in-person has only increased her own enthusiasm and anticipation for being part of Swansea City."

Despite the addition of another investor and minority owner the club said that they would be "likely" to have a quiet January transfer window.

"Given the high turnover of players in our squad over the 2025 summer window, and Vitor's track record of developing and improving young players, we do not expect the January window to be a particularly busy one for Swansea City.

"We will, of course, always be looking for ways to strengthen the squad and if we believe those opportunities are available and would represent good deals for the club then we will look to capitalise, but given the size of the squad we have already it's likely January will be relatively quiet," the statement said.

Stewart joining the Swans follows former Ballon d'Or winner Modric becoming an investor and co-owner at the Championship club in April, with rapper Snoop Dogg following suit a couple of months later.

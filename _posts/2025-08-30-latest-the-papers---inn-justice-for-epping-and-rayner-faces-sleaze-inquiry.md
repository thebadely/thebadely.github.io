According to new developments, The High Court ruling which means asylum seekers can stay at The Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, is on many front pages. The Times reports that 13 councils are still seeking to shut asylum hotels despite the victory by the Home Office. Home Office minister Dame Angela Eagle is quoted as saying that the government will stick to its plans to end the use of the hotels by 2029. The Sun brands the ruling an "innjustice", while the Daily Express says campaigners are calling for ministers to "hang their heads in shame".

Many front pages also feature stories about the housing arrangements of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner. The Daily Telegraph reports that the Conservatives have written to the prime minister's independent standards adviser, calling for an investigation into whether she paid the correct taxes on various homes. The paper says Rayner insists she has done no wrong and quotes her spokesman, as does the Times, saying that she paid the duty owed on the purchase of a flat in Hove "in line with relevant requirements and entirely properly". The paper says there is no suggestion she broke any laws.

Reporting on the situation in Gaza, the Guardian reveals hundreds of employees of the United Nations human rights agency have backed a letter telling its leadership to declare Israel's offensive a genocide. The letter also criticises UN high commissioner Volker Turk for failing to go beyond condemning Israel. In response, the newspaper reports Turk said the letter raised important concerns.

The i Paper's front page features results of exclusive polling for the paper which suggest a "shock" 15-point lead for Reform UK over Labour. The paper says if the poll results were matched in an election held today, Reform would win 400 seats.

A photo of actress Julia Roberts at the Venice Film Festival features on the front of the Telegraph which also includes a positive review of her new film After the Hunt. She also appears on the front of the Guardian with a quote from her that "we're losing the art of conversation" as she defends her controversial new #MeToo themed film.

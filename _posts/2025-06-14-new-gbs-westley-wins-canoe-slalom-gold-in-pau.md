According to new developments, Westley's victory came at the second canoe slalom world cup of the season

Great Britain's Ryan Westley claimed his first career canoe slalom World Cup gold with victory in the men's C1 in Pau, France.

The 31-year-old's run of 97.74s was just enough to hold off France's Yohann Senechault and Spain's Miquel Trave who finished second and third respectively.

"I saw what those lads were putting down, listened to the commentary and I didn't really think I had it in me so it left me no option to just go for it," Westley said.

"I crossed the finish line and didn't expect to see green. I'm buzzing."

It is his first World Cup gold having previously won two silvers and three bronzes.

Australia's Olympic champion Jessica Fox won the 35th gold of her career in the women's C1 final.

The victory for Westley comes after compatriot Lois Leaver earned bronze in the women's K1 on Friday.

It was a second successive medal for Leaver after she won bronze in kayak cross at the first World Cup leg of the season in La Seu d'Urgell in Spain last weekend.

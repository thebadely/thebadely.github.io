According to new developments, Thomas Tuchel has won seven of his eight games since taking charge of England in January, with his sole defeat coming in a friendly against Senegal

Thomas Tuchel said he accepted the pointed chants aimed in his direction by fans during the win over Latvia that secured England's place at the World Cup.

Travelling supporters targeted Tuchel with numerous songs throughout the game after the German manager criticised fans after last week's win over Wales.

The England boss had said he felt underwhelmed by the home support at Wembley during Thursday's 3-0 friendly win, comments that prompted a vocal response from fans who made the trip to Riga.

Supporters chanted "Thomas Tuchel, we'll sing when we want" and "Thomas Tuchel, are we loud enough for you".

After the 5-0 win in the Latvian capital that booked England's place at the World Cup next summer, Tuchel said: "I got a bit of stick today in the first half, so fair enough. I take it in good humour, with a good sense of humour. I accept it.

"They had a reason today from my last comments and I guess that's fair enough.

"I got a bit of stick and I found it quite creative. It made me smile and this is how it has to be. It's British humour and I surely can take it. No harm done."

On the impact of England's fans between now and the World Cup, he added: "It's so important. They are here and I said the support in Serbia was brilliant. 

"The support today was brilliant and we are very sure the support in America will be absolutely brilliant. We need it.

"It makes such a difference if you go out as a player or as a coach and you see the fans behind the team and singing. This is also part of what we do.

"We want to make them proud, we want to make them happy. They should be happy to watch us and they should be able to identify with how we play.

"We are on our way to build something and top performance from them today."

Captain Harry Kane scored twice in the first half, taking his England goals tally to 76

Captain Harry Kane scored twice in the first half in Riga, taking him to 20 goals this season in 11 games for England and club Bayern Munich. 

But it was his work rate and leadership that impressed Tuchel most.

"Harry just gave a speech when he said that everyone will be ready to keep this thing going in November, that no-one will step back and take this thing for granted. They feel they're building something.

"If you just look at the goal in the 85th minute, the goal from Ebs (Eze), we have a ball lost and Harry goes all the way back to his own half and puts his head down in another sprint defensively," explained Tuchel.

"As a captain, as number nine, there is no real need to do this. No-one would ever blame him if he did not do it but he does it and that is the standard and that is the example that he sets and what everyone feels at the moment.

"And that is so brilliant to see as he helps us win the ball and in the end results in the goal from Ebs, a brilliant goal.

"Harry is ready to put in the intensity and the shift that is needed. It is a pleasure to have him. He is in excellent shape physically, mentally, in top form, top shape. So everything fine."

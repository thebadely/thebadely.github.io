It has been recently reported that Actress and singer Cynthia Erivo brought a touch of Wicked glamour to Strictly Come Dancing on Saturday night.

The Oscar nominee, who stars as Elphaba in the hit film, took on a new role as Strictly's first ever guest mentor, leaving some of the celebrities starstruck.

"She's a true goddess," said model and actor Ellie Goldstein, after Erivo praised her energy during the dance show's annual movie-themed week.

And after she had showered Amber Davies with praise, the former Love Islander said it was the "best day of her life".

"She is everything I want to be," Davies added, after Erivo told her she felt like a "proud parent" watching her dance.

It marks a return to the show for Erivo, who was a guest judge for two weeks in 2021, and it sparked a big reaction on social media.

"I loved how much she boosted the confidence of every contestant," wrote one X user, while another said she would have "cried tears" if Erivo had told her she "was fab".

Erivo wasn't the only nod to Wicked during Saturday night's show.

The opening dance routine for movie week was inspired by the film's forthcoming sequel, Wicked: For Good, which hits cinemas next month.

The female professional dancers wore black dresses like the film's Wicked Witch of the West, while the men channelled their inner Prince Fiyero.

Set against a green and blue backdrop, the number was theatrical, dramatic andâ€¦ a bit spooky.

Elsewhere, it was a truly cinematic evening as the Strictly contestants embodied their characters for movie week.

The highest score of the night went to Emmerdale star Lewis Cope, who bagged the first 10 of the series.

Cope and his professional dance partner Katya Jones took on the classic film The Mask of Zorro for their routine, as they did the Paso Double to the song The Plaza of Execution.

In total, they netted 37 points from the judges, with head judge Shirley Ballas calling their routine "extraordinary".

We also saw Goldstein live out her Barbie dreams, as she did daring dips, squats and swirls in a silver sequin jumpsuit, while Davies and Olympian Harry Aikines-Aryeetey also impressed.

TikToker George Clarke scored 31 for his K-Pop Demon Hunters-inspired couple's choice dance.

And performer La Voix's Waltz left the audience and judges in a stunned silence, after a magical waltz in which she became Mary Poppins. Erivo called her performance "beautiful" and "vulnerable".

But movies do have endings, and they're not always happy.

Someone will have to go home on Sunday night.

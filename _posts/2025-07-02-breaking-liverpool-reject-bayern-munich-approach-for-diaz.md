Experts revealed that Diaz joined Liverpool from Porto in January 2022

Liverpool have rejected a formal approach from Bayern Munich for forward Luis Diaz.

Bayern director of sport Max Eberl has been informed that the Premier League club have no intention of selling Diaz and will not enter into discussions for the attacker.

Diaz, 28, was the subject of a similar approach from Barcelona earlier this summer which the Premier League champions also rebuffed.

Liverpool are adamant that Diaz is not for sale at any price this summer, given his key contribution to the team since his arrival from Porto in 2022.

The Colombia international scored 22 goals for club and country last season as he emerged as an integral member of Arne Slot's title-winning side.

He scored 13 goals and made seven assists in the league as Liverpool won the title by 10 points.

Diaz, who has two years left to run on his contract at Anfield, attracted interest from Manchester City last summer and also has admirers in Saudi Arabia.

"I'm very happy at Liverpool - I've always said so," said Diaz when on international duty earlier this summer.

"The transfer market is opening, and we're trying to arrange what's best for us. I'm waiting to see what happens.

"If Liverpool give us a good extension or I have to see out my two-year contract, I'll be happy. It all depends on them. I'm here to decide and see what's best for us and the future."

Meanwhile, Liverpool have confirmed former Netherlands international Giovanni van Bronckhorst will be joining the club as an assistant coach to manager Arne Slot.

Van Bronckhorst succeeds John Heitinga, who left the Premier League champions to become the head coach at Ajax.

Fifty-year-old Van Bronckhorst, who played in the Premier League for Arsenal, has managed Rangers, Besiktas and Feyenoord.

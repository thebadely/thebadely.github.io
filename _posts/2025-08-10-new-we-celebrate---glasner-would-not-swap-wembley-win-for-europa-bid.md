Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Oliver Glasner guided Crystal Palace to their maiden FA Cup win in May

Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner says he would not swap their Community Shield victory for a spot in next season's Europa League.

The FA Cup holders claimed their second trophy in three months - and first Community Shield - by overcoming Premier League champions Liverpool on penalties after the match ended 2-2 at Wembley.

Palace will find out on Monday whether they will be allowed to play in Europe's second-tier cup competition in 2025-26.

The Eagles were demoted to the Uefa Conference League as punishment for breaching multi-club ownership rules, as American businessman John Textor owns a stake in the club and is the majority owner of Lyon, who also qualified for the Europa League.

An appeal was submitted against their demotion with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas).

The appeal is against Uefa, which issued the punishment, French club Lyon and Premier League rivals Nottingham Forest - with a decision expected on Monday.

When asked whether he would swap the Wembley win for a successful appeal, Glasner replied: "No. The players were not scared of noise around us. 

"Tomorrow we have no influence, so we celebrate tonight, meet tomorrow for lunch then training. We can't think about it."

Penalty shootout hero Dean Henderson added Palace's potential demotion from the Europa League to the Conference League would "devalue the competition".

"I think you will see by today, we don't take too much notice of it at the end of the day," Henderson told BBC Radio 5 Live at Wembley. "We win the FA Cup, we are justified to be in the Europa League. 

"For football purposes we deserve to be in the Europa League. I think it would devalue the competition unfortunately if we weren't in the Europa League. 

"Things that are won on the pitch should be rewarded and I think every neutral football fan would agree with that. Let's see. I know the chairman [Steve Parish] has fought hard against it and fingers crossed we are in the Europa League like we deserve to be. 

"I know Crystal Palace fans have waited 120 years, maybe even longer, for the first trophy and chance to go on a European tour. 

"To have that taken away from us is just not right for football and I think everyone would agree with that. I am sure they will see sense and put us back in the Europa League."

Experts revealed that Adrien Truffert was part of the France team that won a silver medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics

Bournemouth have signed defender Adrien Truffert from Rennes in a Â£14.4m deal.

The 23-year-old France left-back has agreed a five-year contract.

The deal is made up of an Â£11.4m fee and a possible Â£3m in add-ons, while Rennes have negotiated a 10% sell-on clause.

Bournemouth defender Milos Kerkez is in talks to join Liverpool.

"It's a great opportunity for me to keep progressing and to be part of an ambitious project," said Truffert.

"I felt the club's confidence in me from the first discussions, and I'm excited to get started."

Truffert made his first-team debut for Rennes in 2020 and made 212 appearances for the club where he became club captain.

He progressed through France's youth levels before making his senior debut in 2022.

"Adrien is a player that we've admired for some time and he brings significant experience to the squad despite still being just 23," said Bournemouth president of football operations Tiago Pinto.

"We're excited to work with Adrien and are thrilled to have a player of such quality join us."

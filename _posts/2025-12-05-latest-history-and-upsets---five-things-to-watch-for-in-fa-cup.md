According to new developments, Brackley Town could reach the FA Cup third round for the first time in their history

The drama of the FA Cup always ramps up another notch in the second round.

One more game of football. One more win. That's all that now stands between the 11 non-league clubs still in the competition and the potential to face one of the Premier League's big boys.

It's not just the allure of a team from the top flight, there is also the chance to make history this weekend.

In round two, 14 League One sides and 15 from League Two also remain, with the Championship and Premier League clubs not entering until the next stage.

We've picked out five key things to look out for over the next couple of days.

Slough Town have lost in the FA Cup second round nine times and have never made it to the third round

Three teams will be looking to create history this weekend - and four if you include re-formed Macclesfield.

National League South sides Weston-super-Mare and Slough Town and National League Brackley Town have never reached the FA Cup third round before, while the Silkmen, who now play in National League North, did so 11 times in their previous iteration but haven't since they returned in 2020.

Slough welcome Macclesfield on Sunday (12:30 GMT) in one of the ties of the round. 

Slough manager Scott Davies said it was an "incredible" opportunity and that his side are full of "confidence, enthusiasm and motivation to go and get a big tie in the next round".

"The FA Cup is special and we're lucky that we're still in it," Davies told BBC Radio Berkshire.

"It's absolutely huge. I think from prize money and being on TV, we've got Â£126,000 so far. It's obviously a massive bonus for the club but it's well deserved.

"We're the last remaining Berkshire team and it's the first time that any team in Berkshire has stayed in the competition longer than Reading for about 40 years."

The Rebels hold the record for the most second round appearances - a total of nine - without making it to the third round, but Davies knows they face a tough test to break that duck.

"It's not a perfect opportunity because Macclesfield are a really good side but we've certainly got a good opportunity to hopefully get through and you just never know," he added.

"You can then dare to dream of a trip to Old Trafford. I don't want it to be something we regret in years to come. I'm hoping we can put in a performance that gets us through and then we can go into dreamland territory."

How to follow the FA Cup on the BBC this weekend

When is the FA Cup third round draw?

Weston-super-Mare are one of five sixth tier sides still in the competition

Because of how the draw has fallen, at least two non-league teams from the sixth tier are guaranteed to be in the hat for the third round.

Slough against Macclesfield is not the only all sixth-tier tie in the second round.

Weston-super-Mare will look to reach the third round for the first time when they visit fellow National League South side Chelmsford City, who have not done so themselves since 1972-73.

Saturday's fixture is exactly 22 years since the Seagulls played in the second round for the first and only time until now, when they were beaten 4-1 at Northampton Town.

Non-league Brackley Town beat Notts County on penalties in the FA Cup first round

The beauty of the FA Cup is the opportunity it provides for the underdog to topple a superior side - and there are a few potential upsets on the cards in the second round.

Brackley dramatically beat League Two Notts County 4-3 on penalties after a 2-2 draw in the last round and will be hoping to go one better when they welcome League One side Burton Albion on Monday.

There are 49 league places separating Brackley, who are 20th in the National League, from the Brewers who sit 19th in the third tier.

But Burton were dumped out of the cup at this stage last season on penalties by National League side Tamworth, and Brackley will be hoping to repeat the trick.

Brackley come into the contest off the back of five straight league defeats, but Burton boss Gary Bowyer says "form goes out the window for both teams".

"It's a special competition, it creates special memories and we want to try and get our own on Monday and carry it on," Bowyer told BBC Radio Derby.

"What we did well in the last round [in the 6-0 win over St Albans City], we showed professionalism, we showed our attitude and energy and we've got to do that again.

"We're fully aware of the challenge that lies ahead on Monday night. We pay them the utmost respect as normal, like any team. I went and watched them myself personally. They've got some experienced players.

"Our focus has to be on this game, we can't get ahead of ourselves. For both teams, the reward is potentially really big."

From out-shining Cole Palmer to springing FA Cup joy at Buxton

Orient aiming to write new FA Cup chapter

BBC to show Boreham Wood and Sutton FA Cup ties

Elsewhere, National League North outfit Buxton will be aiming to reach the third round for the first time since 1951-52 when they visit League Two relegation battlers Cheltenham Town, who are 39 league places above them.

Among the ranks for Buxton will be former Manchester City academy player Tai Sodje, who spent a decade with the Citizens and played alongside Cole Palmer.

Perhaps the most likely venue for an upset could be at Bloomfield Road as League One strugglers Blackpool welcome Carlisle, who are flying high in the National League, sitting second.

The Cumbrians were relegated from the EFL last season but are unbeaten in their past 11 games, winning nine of them, and knocked out League One Reading in the last round with a 3-2 victory after extra time.

Blackpool had a mini-resurgence after Ian Evatt replaced Steve Bruce as boss but since winning their first three in a row under the new head coach, the Tangerines are without a win in five.

Richie Wellens took Leyton Orient to the fourth round last season, beating Championship side Derby before losing 2-1 to Manchester City

The FA Cup second round weekend begins under the lights at the Peninsula Stadium on Friday (19:30 GMT).

Salford City reached the third round for the first time in their history last season and are looking to do so again when they welcome Leyton Orient.

O's boss Richie Wellens returns to the club he managed for just four months between November 2020 and March 2021 during the Covid pandemic when supporters were not allowed to attend matches.

"At Salford, it was difficult, no fans, there was no interaction with the supporters and every club I've been at we've had a good interaction with the community," Wellens told BBC Radio London.

"But we could never have that, so it's not a period I look back on with any fond memories.

"They've moved on, I've moved on, I wish them all the best. I like Karl [Robinson]. But obviously I want them to get knocked out on Friday. But I hope at the end of the season, they come up."

League Two Grimsby Town might have the advantage of being one division and 21 league places above National League side Wealdstone.

But the Mariners might not have been all too pleased when they saw the Stones' name come out of the hat.

Grimsby saw their FA Cup run ended by the same opponents in the first round last season as they sunk to a 1-0 defeat.

Could history repeat itself? If so, Wealdstone will book their place in the third round for the first time since 1978.

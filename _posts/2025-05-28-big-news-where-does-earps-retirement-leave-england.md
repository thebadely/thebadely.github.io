Earps elevated levels of goalkeeping in England

England's preparations for the European Championship this summer have suffered a blow with the news of Mary Earps' international retirement.

The 32-year-old had been the Lionesses' undisputed starting goalkeeper since 2021, but recently found herself ousted by Chelsea's Hannah Hampton.

With Hampton expected to start in goal at Euro 2025 in Switzerland this summer, Earps announced her immediate retirement on Tuesday, just five weeks before the start of the tournament.

Her decision leaves Sarina Wiegman and her squad in an unexpected situation. So where do they go from here?

Nobody was exepecting Earps to retire at this stage, not least Wiegman.

The England manager admitted she was "disappointed" by Earps' decision, having hoped she would play an "important role" this summer.

Earps' team-mates only found out on Monday when they reported for upcoming Nations League games against Portugal and Spain. She did not train and returned home.

"I don't think any of us saw that coming. I'm in shock really," Euro 2022 winner Ellen White told BBC Radio 5 Live's Women's Football Weekly.

"It's so close to the Euros. I don't really know what to say because it is just crazy. It's surprising with the timing and how close it is to the Euros."

Whether Earps would have played in Switzerland or not, her absence will surely have a significant impact on the squad.

"She's a huge character, a leader in the team, so she is going to be a big loss," added White.

"One thing that I know about Mary, when the team is at a low point or in a tournament when sometimes the emotions dip, she brings a lot of energy when it's needed," England midfielder Keira Walsh said.

Over 53 caps, Earps helped England win Euro 2022 and reach the final of the 2023 World Cup, and has twice been named the best women's goalkeeper in the world.

"She's a fantastic person, a fantastic goalkeeper. Without her there would have been no Euros win for the Lionesses," fellow Euros-winner Jill Scott told BBC Breakfast.

England manager Wiegman is now left with a lack of experience in the goalkeeping department as two of the three remaining in the squad - Manchester City's Khiara Keating and Anna Moorhouse of Orlando Pride - have no senior caps.

Hannah Hampton has kept six clean sheets in 13 England appearances

There remain unanswered questions regarding Earps' decision to retire, but one thing is clear - Hampton is England's number one.

The 24-year-old has been limited to 13 caps since making her senior debut in 2022, partly because she was dropped from the squad in later that year because of attitude concerns, and due to Earps' form.

This season Hampton played a key role in Chelsea winning a domestic treble, while she has started England's last three games ahead of Earps, including an impressive 1-0 win against Spain at Wembley.

"She is England's number one, there is no question about it," said White.

"I think it does leave her to have a lot of pressure on her shoulders now. It feels like she has to be flawless now, and Hannah has got that in her.

"She has got a hell of a lot of [club] experience, she is an unbelievable goalkeeper."

Scott felt that Earps "would have challenged Hannah," irrespective of who ended up starting England's Euros opener against France on 5 July.

"I've known her since she was 16 at Birmingham," said White.

"I feel so excited for her and I feel like she is ready to prove to the world that she is one of the best goalkeepers."

The obvious worry for Wiegman is what to do should Hampton suffer an injury or pick up a suspension during the Euros.

Manchester City's Keating is likely the next in line, though she is yet to earn a senior cap and has endured an inconsistent season.

After starting all 22 of City's Women's Super League matches last season and winning the WSL Golden Glove award, this term the 20-year-old had to share game time with summer signing Ayaka Yamashita.

Keating's performance levels dropped significantly as she made several errors, including two in a 4-2 home defeat to Manchester United.

Like Hampton, her distribution is among the strongest in the WSL.

Moorhouse - also uncapped - is the other goalkeeper currently in Wiegman's squad.

The 30-year-old Orlando Pride goalkeeper received her first senior call-up last July having never represented England at youth level.

Having previously played for Durham, Doncaster Rovers Belles, Arsenal and West Ham, Moorhouse left French side Bordeaux to join Orlando in 2022, where she won the NWSL Shield and the NWSL Championship last season.

Ellie Roebuck could be a wildcard option should Wiegman want to add some experience to her goalkeeping group.

Roebuck has endured a turbulent couple of years - after falling out of favour at Manchester City under then-manager Gareth Taylor, the 25-year-old suffered a stroke after agreeing to join Barcelona.

Though Roebuck made a full recovery, she has made just two league appearances since joining the Catalan club last summer.

With 11 England caps she is more experienced than both Keating and Moorhouse, though her last call-up came in October 2023.

Earp's retirement could see her come in from the cold.

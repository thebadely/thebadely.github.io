Let's dive into the details: The Times says ministers have been warned about the financial risks of their environmental aim to reach net zero by 2050. The National Energy System Operator - which the paper describes as "the government body in charge of keeping the country's lights on" - says the plan risks costing the UK £350bn more than a slower approach to reducing carbon emissions. A spokesperson for the energy department says they don't believe these costings accurately reflect the benefits of moving to clean energy.

Many of the papers look in more detail at the Trump administration's proposal to ask tourists from dozens of countries - including the UK - to provide their social media history for the past five years. The Financial Times says the plans are likely to raise concerns within the travel industry - especially as the US prepares to co-host the men's World Cup next summer, with Mexico and Canada. The Guardian also picks up on this point, noting that FIFA expects five million fans at the games and millions more to visit the three countries. The Metro's headline is "defensive trawl for World Cup fans".

Argentina's president Javier Milei has told the Daily Telegraph that talks with Britain are under way to lift a Falklands War-era weapons ban. UK export rules restrict any weapon with British components from being sold to Argentina if it "enhances" the country's military. A government spokesman has denied the claims, saying there are "no specific talks" taking place with Argentina about the UK "relaxing its arms export controls".

According to the i Paper, the UK is set to sign a deal to rejoin the EU's student exchange scheme from January 2027. Talks are due to take place next week. The UK left the Erasmus programme after Brexit.

And many papers highlight some of the more unusual heritage sites to be added to Historic England's listings this year. They include Second World War anti-tank defences in Surrey, known as dragon's teeth, and guide posts in Cheshire which were used to help early motorists. Historic England is quoted as saying these newly protected sites help connect us to the people and events that shaped our communities.

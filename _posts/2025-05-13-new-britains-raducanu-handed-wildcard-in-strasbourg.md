According to new developments, Emma Raducanu was beaten 6-1 6-2 by Coco Gauff in the Italian Open last 16 on Monday

British number two Emma Raducanu will play one final tournament before the French Open after being handed a wildcard in Strasbourg.

Raducanu, ranked 49th in the world, won three consecutive clay-court matches for the first time in her career at the Italian Open before defeat by world number three Coco Gauff in the last 16 on Monday.

It was thought her run in Rome would be her last tournament before heading to Roland Garros for this year's second major, which begins on 25 May.

The 22-year-old, however, will make her debut at the Internationaux de Strasbourg, which starts on Monday. 

The tournament posted on X on Tuesday: "A new Grand Slam champion will step on to the clay courts of the #IS25: Emma RADUCANU!"

The Briton's sole major success so far was her victory in the 2021 US Open.

According to new developments, Britain's Matt Richardson has now lowered the mark in the flying 200m on three occasions

Britain's Matt Richardson has broken his own world record in the 200m flying start, a day after becoming the first cyclist to go under nine seconds in the discipline.

The sprinter has now lowered the mark in the flying 200m on three occasions having briefly first held the record in 2024, while representing Australia at the Paris Olympics.

Richardson, 26, eclipsed Dutchman Harrie Lavreysen's old benchmark on Thursday with a time of 8.941 seconds and shaved a fraction off that time on Friday with a run of 8.857secs in Konya, Turkey.

"There was more time on the table after yesterday's out of sprint lane ride," said Richardson.  

"I knew if I came in with good execution and rode as close to the black as possible I'd go quicker and that's what happened.

"[I'm feeling] pretty good, a big, big relief. I knew there was more in the tank yesterday, so I was obviously really stoked about yesterday but I was hungry for more."

The 25-year-old, who switched nationalities back to Britain in August 2024 was born in Kent but moved to Western Australia at the age of nine, and maintained dual citizenship during his 16 years living there.

The flying 200m is not a championship medal event, but is used as a qualifying effort to seed riders in the match sprint.

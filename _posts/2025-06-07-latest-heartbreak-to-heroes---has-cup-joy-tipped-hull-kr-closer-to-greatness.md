It has been recently reported that Hull KR will be looking to build on their first Challenge Cup win since 1980

Hull KR have not fared well in their pursuit of silverware in the past couple of years, let alone since 1980 when they most recently won the Challenge Cup.

After losing to Leigh in golden-point extra time in the 2023 Challenge Cup final, they were edged out by Wigan, one of the greatest sides the modern game has ever seen, in last season's Super League Grand Final.

But that near-half century drought ended on Saturday, when Mikey Lewis sailed his kick through the posts to help the Robins edge past Warrington with late drama at Wembley.

And what makes their recent success even more remarkable is they dropped out of Super League less than a decade ago.

BBC Sport takes a look at what the victory means to a side that might finally just be knocking on the door of greatness.

It is worth giving some perspective as to Hull KR's position when Willie Peters was announced as their head coach in early 2023.

The Australian arrived off the back of a campaign which had seen former boss Tony Smith leave midway through the previous season and Danny McGuire take the helm on a temporary basis.

There was little to suggest KR were on the precipice of Super League stardom.

Yet, in his maiden season, he guided them to the Challenge Cup final, albeit a losing one.

The Robins licked their wounds and stormed their way to last season's Super League Grand Final.

They even went toe-to-toe with Wigan for the League Leaders' Shield in the lead up - something that might have seemed impossible when KR lost their Super League status in 2016.

Less than a decade later, they are Challenge Cup winners and now look in pole position to tee up an impressive league and cup double.

"It's a weird feeling. It's a crazy feeling, it's unbelievable," Peters told BBC Sport of his side's Challenge Cup triumph.

"They were awesome, Warrington, but I'm so proud of my players. They played remarkable, we didn't win pretty but we found a way."

Man of Steel Mikey Lewis showed his composure for the match-winning moment

All great sides, no matter the sport, need a clutch player.

For Hull KR, half-back Lewis fits that mould.

The reigning Man of Steel dazzled in 2024, roaring his side to victory with some stellar performances across the season, leading to him winning the top individual award.

And the 23-year-old has been through it all with his side over the past two years. And falling short proved to be extra motivation.

"The heartbreak two or three years ago, it really sums it up," Lewis told BBC Sport.

"These are finals I want to play for the rest of my career at this club, I love it, and hopefully we can go again."

It speaks volumes that Lewis was able to compose himself for his cup-winning conversion.

With the Ashes series coming up at the end of the season, his ability to stay calm in a big-game situation will surely mean he will be England boss Shaun Wane's starting half-back come October.

"I thought I just had to go through my process and trust it and that's what I did," Lewis added.

"We're tough. It wasn't our best performance but that's what tough teams do."

Challenge Cup final: Hull KR claim dramatic late win over Warrington - as it happened

Whereas Hull KR have put in some stunning performances on their way to victory this season, it is fair to say the Challenge Cup final might not have set the world alight for the neutral.

It was edgy and attritional for much of the 80 minutes with neither side wanting to give anything away.

Despite was the quality of the game, captain Elliot Minchella was just happy for his side to get over the line.

"I'm lost for words. I thought we'd blown it, to be honest," he told BBC Sport.

"That's what we pride ourselves on, never giving in. It was the ugliest performance all year but it doesn't matter, does it?"

If Hull KR are to undo Wigan's domestic dominance it is likely to come by grinding out wins and putting the work in again from early next week as the season continues.

But for Peters, he sees the bigger picture and understands just how seismic a win it was for more than just his squad. 

"I was a little more vocal than usual. When Mikey was going to kick the goal, players like that, they come up with special plays. That was a moment for him, a moment he'll have forever. I felt calm then," he added.

"This is for so many people who aren't here today. People who are not with us, people have worked hard to get us to this.

"Hopefully, this gives them the belief that they can do it. We did it today. It wasn't our best performance but it was gritty."

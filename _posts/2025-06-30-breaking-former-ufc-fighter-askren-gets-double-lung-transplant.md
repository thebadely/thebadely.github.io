Let's dive into the details: Ben Askren retired with a record of 19 wins in 22 fights

Former UFC fighter Ben Askren has received a "double lung transplant" after being hospitalised with "severe pneumonia".

Askren, 40, retired from MMA in 2019 after a short stint in the UFC.

Earlier this month, Askren was admitted to hospital in Wisconsin and placed on ventilator and put on the transplant list.

His wife, Amy, wrote on Facebook that her husband was "completely healthy just five weeks ago".

"We are forever thankful to the donor and his family. This is the beginning of a new lifestyle for Ben, but every new day he has is a gift," she said.

"I'm hopeful that in coming weeks Ben will be able to give the next update, but hopefully he will wait until the drugs wear off."

Askren developed pneumonia after suffering from staph infection and on Saturday, Jake Paul made a public plea for donations to be made for his recovery. Paul beat Askren in a boxing match in 2021.

Askren is considered one of the best American wrestlers of his generation and was a welterweight champion in Bellator and ONE Championship.

Before moving into MMA, Askren was a two-time national champion in wrestling and a member of the 2008 United States Olympic team.

Askren was unbeaten in 20 fights when he signed for the UFC in 2019, in what was an unusual move in MMA.

The UFC traded their flyweight champion Demetrious Johnson to ONE Championship, receiving Askren in return.

It is still the only time a type of "trade" has happened in major MMA and was a huge shock at the time in 2018.

Askren was hugely popular in the UFC, winning his debut against Robbie Lawler before slipping to defeats to Jorge Masvidal and Demian Maia.

He retired from MMA with 19 wins in 22 fights. He has three children and runs his own wrestling academy in Wisconsin.

Experts revealed that Women's Rugby World Cup - Pool C: Ireland v Spain

Venue: Franklin's Gardens, Northampton Date: Sunday, 31 August Kick-off: 12:00 BST

Coverage: Live on BBC Two, BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sport website and app.

After all the build-up and talk about injuries and slow starts, it was encouraging to see Ireland back making a mark on the World Cup stage last weekend. 

Given it was a 42-14 win, there were a lot of positives to take from the performance against Japan. The tries came early, the bonus point was secured before half-time and there were some memorable moments for the large Irish support to savour. 

It was a big game for some returning stalwarts too, with co-captains Sam Monaghan and Edel McMahon putting in big shifts after returning from injury. It was especially big for Sam, who ran herself into the ground for 80 minutes not long after returning from 13 months out. 

Elsewhere, wingers Beibhinn Parsons and Amee-Leigh Costigan scored a try apiece, Dannah O'Brien showed a lot of control at fly-half - and was perfect from the kicking tee - and the scrum grew into the game.

Another bonus-point win on Sunday and the knockout stages will start to beckon. Reaching the quarter-finals would represent a significant checkpoint in this team's journey.

It would be a gratifying return after the sacrifices these players have made and the work they have poured into changing this team's trajectory. 

Even being on a World Cup pitch last weekend, it was clear to see how much it meant, not only to those who were playing against Japan but to everyone who has gone through the turmoil of the past four or five years. 

The upturn in performances, the win over New Zealand last year and the fearlessness with which they approached their first World Cup game in eight years... This is what happens when a team is adequately supported by their union.

But while the excitement around the team continues to build, the players and coaches won't be getting carried away just yet. It wasn't a perfect performance against Japan and they will know there are issues to iron out against Spain before the expected pool decider against New Zealand in a fortnight.

The line-out will be a big point of focus in training this week. It provided a good platform at times against Japan but it was inconsistent. 

Japan were not strong enough to really punish Ireland in this area but it will be a different story against the top teams. The likes of New Zealand, France and England can be absolutely ruthless here so Ireland need their line-out as an exit tool inside their own 22. 

At times, Ireland didn't gain enough territory from their phase play and there will be a recognition that barely gaining 10 metres from three, four, five phases will be too energy-sapping against the strongest teams. 

There is always a risk of disrupting a winning formula but Ireland need to build depth so it would not be surprising to see a few changes for Spain. Dannah O'Brien and Aoibheann Reilly both acquitted themselves well against Japan but it is too much to expect nines and 10s to play 80 minutes every week. 

Nicole Fowley has not been involved in recent matchday squads, so it would be an opportunity to give her some minutes while Scott Bemand has two other quality scrum-halves in Emily Lane and Molly Scuffil-McCabe in case he favours a switch at nine. 

Aoife Wafer appears to be closing in on her return from a knee injury and while the coaches will be keen to get her involved before the New Zealand game, it is important for her to be carefully managed. If she does return against Spain and comes through unscathed, it would give the squad a serious boost.

From watching them against New Zealand, it's clear to see that Spain are quick and fiery. Like Ireland, their backline is packed with Sevens players so that is going to be an intriguing battle. 

Spain will be full of fight after losing to the Black Ferns, too. Nobody really expected them to beat New Zealand but they will be fired up to prove a point against Ireland. 

And Ireland will not underestimate them. The 2021 World Cup qualifier and 2023 WXV3 game both went down to the wire, with a win apiece, so Ireland do not need reminding how competitive Spain can be in big games. 

Finally, on the tournament as a whole so far, it is not hard to see why there is such a buzz around this World Cup. 

England's win over the United States set a new attendance record for a Women's Rugby World Cup match with 42,723 fans. England showed why they are tournament favourites while Canada continued their exceptional form, which is even more impressive given their modest level of funding. 

France did not exactly set the tournament alight in their win over Italy and while they are not short of world-class talent, I have reservations about them. Similarly, New Zealand did not make the same impression as England or Canada but I expect them to grow into the tournament and peak at the right time - perhaps ominously from an Irish point of view. 

But Ireland have already made a significant impression on their World Cup return and if they replicate the intensity and work-rate they showed against Japan, they should have too much for Spain, setting them up nicely for that exciting reunion with the Black Ferns in Brighton on 7 September.

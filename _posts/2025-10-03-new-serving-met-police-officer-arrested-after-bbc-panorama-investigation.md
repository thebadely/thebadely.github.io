According to new developments, A serving Metropolitan Police officer has been arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice over an allegation linked to a BBC Panorama investigation.

The officer is a sergeant based at Charing Cross police station and was arrested in relation to an incident that took place on Thursday, a statement from the Met said.

They have since been bailed and suspended from duty.

The arrest follows a Panorama undercover investigation that revealed serving Metropolitan Police officers at the central London station called for immigrants to be shot, revelled in the use of force and were dismissive of rape claims.

The sergeant was arrested by the Met's directorate of professional standards on Thursday evening, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Andy Valentine said.

"We have been extremely clear we will be unrelenting in our approach to tackling issues at Charing Cross, and anywhere else across the Met", Mr Valentine said in a statement.

"Internal reporting mechanisms" brought the "fresh matter" to light, he added. 

"We continue to encourage and support all our officers and staff to report allegations of criminal conduct and behaviour so we can act swiftly".

After the Panorama investigation concluded, the BBC sent a detailed list of allegations to the Met, which then suspended eight officers and one staff member, and took two more officers off front-line duties.

Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley said the behaviour outlined by the show was "disgraceful, totally unacceptable and contrary to the values and standards" of the force.

It has been recently reported that The King has led a chorus of praise for the "awesome" Lionesses after their European Championship victory on Sunday.

After Sarina Wiegman's side clinched a nail-biting win against Spain on penalties, he said England had showed "there are no setbacks so tough that defeat cannot be transformed into victory, even as the final whistle looms". 

Prince William and Princess Charlotte, who watched the match from the stands in Switzerland, said they "couldn't be prouder" of the side.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who was also in attendance, called the team "history makers".

Downing Street said it will hold a special reception for the Lionesses on Monday to mark their "momentous achievement".

The event will be hosted by Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner and sports minister Stephanie Peacock.

In a statement released after the final whistle, King Charles said: "For more years than I care to remember, England fans have sung that famous chant 'football's coming home'.

"As you return home with the trophy you won at Wembley three years ago, it is a source of great pride that, through sporting skill and awesome teamwork, the Lionesses have made those words ring true. 

"For this, you have my whole family's warmest appreciation and admiration.

"Well done, Lionesses. The next task is to bring home the World Cup in 2027 if you possibly can."

Princess Charlotte was seen applauding from the stands alongside her father at St Jakobs-Park in Basel during the hard-fought contest against Spain.

After the match, a statement from her and Prince William was shared on social media: "What a game! Lionesses, you are the champions of Europe. We couldn't be prouder of the whole team. Enjoy this moment England."

The victory saw the Lionesses become only the second women's team after Germany to retain a European Championship, and also the first England football team to win a major trophy away from home.

After the match, Sir Keir wrote on X: "Champions! Congratulations Lionesses - what a team. What a game. What drama.

"You dug deep when it mattered most and you've made the nation proud. History makers."

Goalkeeper Mary Earps, who retired from England duty in May, said her former teammates were "incredible".

An open-top bus tour will be held in central London on Tuesday to mark the win, with a celebration due to be held outside Buckingham Palace.

It will process along The Mall from 12.10pm, before a staged ceremony at the Queen Victoria Memorial.

Fans can attend for free and it will also be broadcast on the BBC.

Downing Street has no plans for a bank holiday to mark the win, the BBC understands.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Rhian Wilkinson (centre) was appointed Wales manager in February 2024

Wales head coach Rhian Wilkinson and her backroom staff will have been deep in conversation over the past few days, weighing up the pros and cons of the players who will be selected to contest the 2025 Women's European Championship.

The waiting - and the selection nerves - will be over on Thursday morning when Wilkinson takes to the summit of Yr Wyddfa (Snowdon) to reveal her squad.

The announcement will give joy to some and heartbreak to others, as Wales ramp up their preparations for the 16-team tournament.

Wilkinson has previously said she was clear on about 20 of the squad places, while there are others than can "go either way".

A total of 23 players are likely to be named officially for the tournament but - as was the case with Wales and the men's World Cup in 2022 - extra training places could be offered to players to form part of the travelling squad.

Wales, who have qualified for a women's major tournament for the first time, will face holders England in Switzerland as well as 2022 Euro semi-finalists France and 2017 champions the Netherlands in the group stage.

Euro 2025 gets under way on 2 July, but Wales - the lowest ranked side in the draw - will kick-off their campaign against the Dutch in Lucerne on 5 July.

Next up on 9 July is France - a side they pushed hard twice in defeats during qualification for the 2023 World Cup - in St Gallen, before facing domestic rivals England - who Wales have never beaten - on 13 July at the same Arena St Gallen.

Wales were relegated from Nations League A after a winless Group 4 campaign

On first examination, Wales' recent relegation from the top tier of the Nations League is hardly the morale boost that Wilkinson would have hoped for going into the Euros.

Wales finished bottom of League A Group 4 with two draws and fours losses from matches against Sweden, Italy and Denmark - teams that have also qualified for the Euros.

But the frustrating campaign could well have a silver lining.

Apart from the 4-1 defeat by Italy in the last group game, with relegation already confirmed and Wilkinson opting to limit the participation of some of her Euro-bound stars, Wales never lost by more than one goal.

Although the lack of a win is a glaring minus, they came very close and have shown, not just to themselves but to the wider footballing world, they can mix it at the game's elite level.

There is a hard-won, genuine belief that they belong in this company and - with a touch more composure, or that slice of fortune that so often decides sporting contests - can turn those close defeats and draws into wins.

As star player Jess Fishlock has already bullishly stated: "We're not there to make up the numbers. I believe - and these girls believe - we're going to get there and compete. 

"We want to get out of the group, we want to get to the knockout stages and I truly believe, hand on heart, we have a good enough group [of players] to do that."

Seattle Reign midfielder Jess Fishlock is Wales' record cap-holder and goalscorer

That brings us nicely on to Fishlock, a generational talent and Wales' record cap-holder and goalscorer.

With 162 caps and 47 goals, the 38-year-old Seattle Reign midfielder is the beating heart of Wales: fiercely competitive, a born leader, oozing class.

There have been injury niggles this season, but the fact that she continues to operate at the highest level in her late 30s is testament to Fishlock's professionalism and hunger to at last represent her country on the big stage.

It is a stage she fully deserves to occupy, front and centre, even if it comes in the twilight of a career that has taken her from Cardiff to Seattle via top-flight clubs across the world including Melbourne Victory, Frankfurt and Olympique Lyonnais.

The Welsh men showed during their heady march to the semi-finals of Euro 2016 how much a close-knit squad of good professionals can achieve with that little sprinkle of stardust.

Gareth Bale provided that for the men and Fishlock can be a similar ace in the hole for Wilkinson's side in Switzerland.

Former Real Madrid star Bale was far from a one-man band though, ably assisted by his midfield muckers Joe Allen and Aaron Ramsey, a core that allowed the players around them to step up to the plate and flourish. 

Sam Vokes and Hal Robson-Kanu were hardly household names before Euro 2016; after that tournament they are part of Welsh footballing folklore.

Fishlock has her own lieutenants, not least her Seattle team-mate Angharad James - who, with 132 caps, has so often lined up alongside her in midfield for club and country. 

Wales will count on the players around those two stepping up at crucial moments at Euro 2025 to write their own chapters into Welsh football history.

Fishlock, James, Hayley Ladd, Gemma Evans, Rachel Rowe and Kayleigh Barton boast a total of 638 international appearances between them.

Wales have a hugely experienced core at the heart of their squad even before you consider former captain Sophie Ingle, but more of the 141-cap midfielder and her chances of playing in Switzerland later.

While Wilkinson will turn to some players who represent clubs outside the top divisions, the bulk of her squad will be made up of those who have been tempered both sides of the Atlantic in the Women's Super League (WSL) and National Women's Soccer League (NWSL).

Those include strikers Ceri Holland (Liverpool), Hannah Cain (Leicester City) and Elise Hughes (Crystal Palace), plus Seattle defender Lily Woodham, who joined Palace on loan last season.

The raw pace of Ffion Morgan, Bristol City's player of the season in their Championship campaign, provides Wilkinson with an important option in attack and the 25-year-old must surely be included.

Likewise IFK Norrkoping's Carrie Jones and fellow midfielder Alice Griffiths, who spent the second half of the season on loan from Southampton at fellow Championship side Durham. 

Newcastle United's 26-year-old defender Lois Joel - another competing in the second-tier Championship that has been rebranded as WSL2 for next season - will likely also go as cover across the backline, but it remains to be seen how much youthful enthusiasm Wilkinson will add to her grizzled veterans.

The likes of Sunderland forward Mary McAteer, 21, Manchester United's once-capped 18-year-old midfielder Mared Griffiths and club-mate defender Scarlett Hill, 17, Aston Villa goalkeeper Soffia Kelly, 18, fellow stopper Poppy Soper - the 23-year-old from Blackburn Rovers - and Bristol City forward Tianna Teisar, 19, have all been called into the squad during the Nations League campaign.

All are likely to have been considered for Switzerland, but many may not make the final cut and will have to wait for their chance in future campaigns.

Sophie Ingle (right) was back training with the Wales squad in June after a serious knee injury

A corner piece of Wilkinson's selection jigsaw is Ingle, the former captain who has sat out the whole season with a serious knee injury sustained in a pre-season match in September.

The 33-year-old, who will leave Chelsea this summer, has still not played since tearing her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in a pre-season friendly with Feyenoord last September.

However, the noises coming out of the Wales camp have been positive on her progress, with Wilkinson saying Ingle is "on track" to be part of Euros selection after the "milestone" of training with team-mates in a session before the game with Italy.

A fit-again Ingle would be a huge fillip to the Wales squad, not just for what she brings on the field but for her calming influence and leadership off it.

Knee injuries have been the bane of Wales' preparations, in common with so many women's teams, with Mayzee Davies the latest ruled out of Euro 2025 after the 18-year-old Manchester City defender ruptured her ACL in the Nations League defeat by Denmark at the end of May.

Wales are also without forward Megan Wynne, who suffered an ACL injury in Perth Glory's final game of the season in April.

Gwalia United goalkeeper Laura O'Sullivan-Jones is another ruled out with an ACL injury, although Wilkinson has said the 33-year-old, capped 59 times, will travel with the squad to help their preparations.

The injury to O'Sullivan-Jones will be less keenly felt by Wales, however, as fellow stoppers Olivia Clark and Safia Middleton-Patel have been the preferred choices during the Nations League campaign.

There is some good news for Wilkinson at least, with 79-cap defender Rhiannon Roberts and Clark both on course to be fit after recent injury scares.

What next for Wales as Euro 2025 awaits?

Wales 'doing a lot of catch-up' heading to Euro 2025

Ingle training return boosts Wales before Euros

A few days after the squad announcement, Wales will head to the Algarve in Portugal for a training camp.

The Cascade resort is a Wales favourite, having previously played host to both the women's and men's teams, while Wilkinson also spent time there during her 183-cap playing career with Canada.

After some finishing touches are applied, Wales will then decamp to their Euro 2025 base in Weinfelden in the north of Switzerland.

While Wilkinson's selection will be confirmed on Thursday at 1,085m above sea level, Wales' highest summit is dwarfed by the Swiss alpine ranges and there may yet be - at least metaphorically - some daunting mountains to climb when the action gets under way there.

But in a tournament that is promoting itself with a tagline of 'the summit of emotions', Wales will aim to peak at just the right moment.

Daniel Dubois tells BBC Sport's Ade Adedoyin that he has "resurrected" his career and feels "unstoppable" going into his undisputed heavyweight world title fight against Oleksandr Usyk at Wembley Stadium on Saturday.

Londoner Dubois is aiming to become the first British undisputed heavyweight champion since 1999, while Ukrainian Usyk is seeking to achieve the feat for a second time in the division.

Dubois, 27, is also targeting revenge for his 2023 stoppage loss to Usyk.

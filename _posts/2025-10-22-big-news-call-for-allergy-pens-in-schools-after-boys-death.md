Let's dive into the details: A mother is urging the government to "act immediately" to roll out spare allergy pens in schools after her five-year-old son died from a reaction to cow's milk.

Benedict Blythe, from Stamford, Lincolnshire, died in hospital after collapsing at Barnack Primary School in December 2021. An inquest found delayed administration of his adrenaline pen was a factor in his death.

His mother, Helen Blythe, said: "No parent should lose a child because medication wasn't there when it was needed. The solutions exist. What's missing is action."

The Department for Education said it was "working across government to consider how we might extend the availability of allergy pens in schools."

Benedict had asthma and a number of allergies to food including eggs, nuts, kiwi fruit and milk.

His parents had worked with the school to put together a personal allergy action plan and a specific process for storing, preparing and supplying oat milk to the pupil.

In July, an inquest jury looking into Benedict's death found that the school did not follow all the measures in place to prevent his death from a fatal anaphylactic reaction to cow's milk which he had been given accidentally.

This included delays in administering his medication, Mrs Blythe said.

At the time, Mrs Blythe called for a new "Benedict's Law" to ensure schools have adequate allergy plans for children and said her son's death was "preventable and caused by a cascade of failures".

The Benedict Blythe Foundation, set up by Mrs Blythe, has published new research with Professor Paul Turner, of Imperial College London, and the National Allergy Strategy Group (NASG) in the Archives of Disease In Childhood, a peer-reviewed journal.

The study said putting spare allergy pens in every UK school could not only save lives but also reduce NHS medication waste, be simpler logistically, improve emergency access and be cost-neutral for most NHS Integrated Care Boards.

It could save the government at least £4.6m a year in costs, the foundation said.

"Despite clear evidence and cost savings that would fully fund "Benedict's Law", the Department for Education has yet to act – leaving pupils starting in school this year at risk," it added..

Mrs Blythe said: "The evidence is now published, peer-reviewed and beyond question – yet nothing has changed.

"Another school year has started and children are still going to class without guaranteed access to adrenaline.

"The Department for Education had this evidence ahead of Benedict's inquest in July. They know what needs to be done – yet schools remain unequipped."

Peter Blythe, Benedict's father, said: "The savings identified are more than sufficient to fund national allergy training, emergency planning and policy development across schools. 

"It's financially sound, evidence-based, and morally urgent."

A Department For Education spokesperson said: "What happened to Benedict was a tragedy for his family and our thoughts remain with all of those who loved him.

"To put a stop to allergies being a barrier to children feeling safe at school, we are planning to consult on strengthened guidance later this year and are working across government to consider how we might extend the availability of allergy pens in schools."

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Golds for Hannah Cockroft and Dan Pembroke helped move Great Britain up to seventh place in the medal table

Hannah Cockroft and Dan Pembroke both added to their lengthy list of world titles on a successful day for the Great Britain team at the World Para Athletics Championships in New Delhi. 

Cockroft, 30, secured her third gold medal at these championships - and her 19th world title overall - as she won the women's T34 800m ahead of British team-mate Kare Adenegan, who won silver.

"On every start line I go 'I don't know how I'm going to get round this' but once I'm going and all in it went to plan," Cockroft told BBC Sport.

"I don't know how long this will last, how long I will be able to do this. I am so thankful I can get out there and do what I love.

"I am looking forward to a quieter year now and relaxing a bit because it's been a full-on 18 months."

Pembroke, 34, claimed a third consecutive world title in the men's F13 javelin with a best throw of 68.51m despite coming into the event under-prepared due to injury.

"Four weeks ago I suffered a hip abductor tear in my right leg, which is not the best thing for a javelin thrower as it basically makes your run-up redundant," Pembroke said.

"I haven't thrown for four-and-a-half weeks since coming out here so I've had to rely on trying to visualise it."

There was also a silver medal for Britain's Jonathan Broom-Edwards in the men's T64 high jump, and bronzess for Michael Jenkins (F38), Anna Nicholson (F35) and Lydia Church (F12) in the shot put. 

With just one day of the championships remaining, Britain extended their total tally of medals to 23, including six golds.

Nine-time Paralympic champion Cockroft completed a hat-trick of gold medals in New Delhi after following up her victories in the 100m and 400m with a fifth world title at 800m. 

She won in a championship-record time of one minute 49.88 seconds, while Adenegan, 24, finished in a season's best 2:03.91 to claim her third silver medal of the championships. 

Paralympic champion and world record holder Pembroke threw more than five metres further than the rest of the field in the F13 javelin - for athletes with a visual impairment - with his best of 68.51m coming on his final attempt. 

Three-time former world champion Broom-Edwards, 37, had to settle for silver this time behind Uzbekistan's Temurbek Giyazov in the men's T64 high jump, with his final effort of 2.00m just 3cm below the gold-medal jump. 

Michael Jenkins, 20, completed a hat-trick of bronze medals for the British team in the shot put. 

The European record holder's throw of 18.84m in the men's F38 final saw him finish behind Colombian Levin Moreno Denis and his compatriot Jose Lemos Rivas, who finished with silver. 

In the morning session, Nicholson, 30, the team's co-captain, finished third in the women's F35 category - for those with a co-ordination impairment - with a personal best throw of 9.58m. 

It was the Gateshead Harrier's first medal at the Worlds, having previously finished fourth at the 2019 championships, and followed her bronze at the 2024 Paralympics in Paris.

Church, 25, managed a throw of 12.6m in the F12 event - for visually impaired athletes - to clinch her first medal on the world stage, having previously claimed silver at the 2021 European Championships.

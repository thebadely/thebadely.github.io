Experts revealed that Temperatures are predicted to hit 30C for the second day in London today as a heatwave continues. The east of England and the Midlands are both forecast to see highs of 28C, according to the Met Office.

An amber heat health alert was issued for some areas on Friday by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) until 18:00 BST Tuesday, with temperatures set to peak on Monday. 

This is the second amber alert in two weeks and means weather impacts are "likely to be felt across the whole health service". 

The head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA has urged people to check on those who are more vulnerable and take "sensible precautions while enjoying the sun".

The alert stretches across London, the East Midlands, South East, South West and East of England.

A yellow heat alert, less serious than amber, has also been issued for Yorkshire and Humber as well as the West Midlands. It denotes "significant impacts" for the health and social care services.

On Monday, the UKHSA has warned, "Much of the country will see temperatures in the early to mid-30s" (C) at the height of the heatwave.

The country's current record high for June rests at 35.6C, set in Southampton's Mayflower Park in 1957 and met again at Camden Square in North London in 1976.

Darren Farmer, Director of Operations at London Ambulance Service has warned: "It's really, really important to keep hydrated" and to "keep away from alcohol" in the heat. 

Keeping out of direct sunlight in the middle of the day and taking your medication in a timely manner are also key, Farmer added.

Carrie Johnson, wife of former prime minister Boris Johnson, has urged breast-feeding mothers in particular to stay hydrated after she was hospitalised for two nights for severe dehydration.

Temperatures at Glastonbury festival, which is now in the last of its five days, are expected to reach 27C on Sunday. The hottest year for the festival was 2017, when highs of 30C saw dozens of people being treated by paramedics.

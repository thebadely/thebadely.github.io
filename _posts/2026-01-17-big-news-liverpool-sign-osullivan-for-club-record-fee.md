Let's dive into the details: Denise O'Sullivan made nine appearances on loan at WSL club Brighton in 2020

Liverpool have signed Republic of Ireland midfielder Denise O'Sullivan on a permanent deal from North Carolina Courage.

The midfielder had a year remaining on her contract with North Carolina but Liverpool have paid a club-record fee in the region of Â£300,000 - their previous record was the Â£210,000 they paid for Olivia Smith in 2024.

The 31-year-old brings a wealth of experience having picked up 128 caps for her country since making her debut in 2011.

She has represented clubs in the United States, Australia, Scotland and England, as well as her native Ireland.

O'Sullivan has played more than 150 games for National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) side North Carolina Courage across nine years, the latest of which as club captain.

Liverpoolâs long-term project and facilities at Melwood are believed to have been a big attraction for OâSullivan, who had interest from several clubs. 

"It means a lot. It's a very proud moment for myself and also for my family, who are now only a 40-minute flight away," said OâSullivan. 

"It is a massive club and I think when you join a club as big as Liverpool it comes with massive responsibility and I can't wait to get to work and to give 100% every day."

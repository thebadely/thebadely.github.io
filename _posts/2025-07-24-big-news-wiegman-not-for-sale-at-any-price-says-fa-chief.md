It has been recently reported that Sarina Wiegman is the first manager to reach five successive major finals

England manager Sarina Wiegman is "not for sale at any price", says Football Association chief executive Mark Bullingham.

Wiegman is the only manager in the men's or women's game to have reached the final at all five major tournaments she has coached in.

She led the Netherlands to the Euro 2017 title and the World Cup final in 2019, before doing the same with England at Euro 2022, and the 2023 World Cup.

The 55-year-old is seeking to become the third manager to win three consecutive women's Euros titles after Germany duo Gero Bisanz (1989, 1991, 1995) and Tina Theune (1997, 2001, 2005).

"I want to pay tribute to Sarina. I think her record individually is phenomenal," said Bullingham, speaking before Sunday's Euro 2025 final against Spain (17:00 BST).

"When I spoke to [the media] before the tournament I said we were lucky to have her and I still feel that way. I think she has been incredible.

"Her record of managing in five tournaments and reaching five finals is phenomenal. I don't believe anyone has been anywhere near that in the past and it will be really hard to do that in the future. 

"She's a really special coach and we're delighted to have her with us."

Asked if the FA are concerned that Wiegman might look elsewhere if she was to be successful again on Sunday, and if it would be hard to persuade her to stay, Bullingham said: "Not hard at all. We are committed to her until 2027 and she is committed to us. We have a new [coaching] team coming in for her. 

"We haven't quite started working on the plans for [the 2027 World Cup] but I know her focus, hopefully after success on Sunday, will shift quite quickly to that."

England fans have developed a new chant for Wiegman during Euro 2025, replacing the word 'tequila' with 'Sarina' in the song from a 1950s American rock and roll band called The Champs.

There have also been shirts made and banners produced with the words: 'In Sarina We Trust'.

But there has also been criticism of Wiegman's starting XI in the defeat by France, her tactics in the tense, quarter-final win over Sweden and the general lateness of her substitutions. 

Are England fans taking her for granted?

"That's hard for me to comment on. What I would say is we have a really special coach and we should all recognise that," said Bullingham.

"I do think her tournament record is incredible but I also see the work she has done with players - the relationships and connections she builds in camps. 

"She is just a cool head and the way she transmits that onto the pitch... She looks like the coolest person in the stadium.

"I have no doubts that helps in critical moments. I can only give my opinion, but she is a really special coach and we are lucky to have her."

Bullingham says there are countries that have got world-class players in their squad who have not enjoyed as much success as Wiegman's teams because she is "special".

Asked why she has been so successful, Bullingham added: "Often she's performed so well at the highest level, keeping that calm composure, keeping the connection with the players and managing the games really well.

"Every single member of staff coming into this camp felt valued by her, knew exactly what their role was and how they could be part of an overall team. 

"[She] really stressed that everyone was in it together. It is critical and I think she's really helped build a very, very strong culture."

Bullingham was asked why Wiegman's salary was not on parity with England men's boss Thomas Tuchel despite recent success.

The FA have not released details on Wiegman's salary but TNT Sports claims she is on an annual wage of Â£400,000, plus potential performance-related bonuses.

Tuchel, who was appointed England men's manager in January, is on a reported Â£5m annual salary as part of his 18-month contract. 

"I think she is obviously operating in a different market," Bullingham told BBC Sport.

"If you think about how we regard the importance of each role, we think they are equally important. The fact we have her locked down until 2027 is fantastic. 

"We're obviously happy with the job she's doing and I've always said she can do any job in world football but we're delighted she's with us and with the Lionesses."

Captain Litton Das hit a 33-ball half-century to guide Bangladesh to a comfortable seven-wicket win over Hong Kong in the Asia Cup.

Having restricted Hong Kong to 143-7, Bangladesh - led by Das' 59 from 39 balls - knocked off the runs with 14 balls to spare.

The Tigers opted to field first in Abu Dhabi and struck twice during the powerplay, and despite Nizakat Khan leading a recovery, top-scoring with 42 from 40, Hong Kong were never able to get away from their Test-playing opponents.

Seamer Tanzim Hasan Sakib was the pick of the Bangladesh attack, taking 2-21, while his fellow quick Taskin Ahmed and wrist-spinner Rishad Hossain also took two wickets.

Bangladesh also lost two wickets in the powerplay but the experienced Das quickly got them back on track in the chase, hitting six fours and a six, as he put on 95 for the third wicket with Towhid Hridoy.

Das fell with just two needed for victory so it was left to Hridoy, who finished unbeaten on 35, to hit the winning run in the 18th over and get Bangladesh's campaign off to a winning start.

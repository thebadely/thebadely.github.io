Let's dive into the details: A new science centre is being built which aims to help protect the UK from future pandemics.

The government has pledged a "multi-billion-pound" investment to make the National Biosecurity Centre (NBC) in Harlow, Essex, the largest of its kind in Europe by bringing the UK Health Security Agency's existing centres in London and Wiltshire to one site.

The agency's scientists  research pathogens and boost vaccine production in an attempt to prepare for potential global disease threats. 

Visiting Harlow, Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: "Covid-19 taught us how crucial it is to be able to respond quickly to new emerging threats and the new NBC will allow us to do exactly that."

The government said the UKHSA would continue operating from Colindale in north-west London and Porton Down in Wiltshire until the new centre in Harlow was fully up and running, to ensure a safe and effective transition.

About 1,600 jobs will be created to support construction of the Harlow site and it would enable closer collaboration between scientists, the government said.

The first facilities are expected to open by the mid-2030s with the site fully operational by 2038.

"Harlow will become a scientific hub, with the National Biosecurity Centre exploring new ways to treat illnesses, improve people's health and save more lives," said Streeting.

"By backing innovation, research and life sciences, we will make our NHS fit for the future, and cement the UK as a life sciences superpower."

The government said "of the total multi-billion investment in the centre, £250m will be spent by the government over this Parliament alone to kickstart delivery". 

"The exact total amount of funding for the centre will be confirmed in due course," a spokesperson added.

It was hoped the NBC would create partnerships between scientists in the industry and the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) to pursue new breakthroughs.

The Harlow site would have laboratories that would be used to study dangerous and new diseases.

Dyfed Alsop, interim UKHSA chief executive, said: "This is fantastic news for the UK and will mean that we can continue to offer the best possible protection for people's health for generations to come."

The announcement follows a government pledge to spend £1bn upgrading a centre that researches animal diseases in Weybridge, Surrey.

The Defence, Science and Technology Laboratory site at Porton Down was not affected by this new development and would remain operational.

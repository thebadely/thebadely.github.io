According to new developments, Emma Raducanu previously beat Amanda Anisimova at this year's Australian Open and Miami Open

Britain's Emma Raducanu won just three games as she was beaten by Wimbledon finalist Amanda Anisimova in the Canadian Open third round.

Raducanu had won both of her previous matches against the world number seven but held serve just twice in a 6-2 6-1 defeat.

Anisimova hit 29 winners to Raducanu's five, while the British number one also made 22 unforced errors.

American Anisimova suffered a heavy defeat in her first Grand Slam final a month ago, but she remains one of the WTA Tour's in-form players.

She has won 14 of her past 17 matches - more than any other player in that time span - and has now won 50 matches at WTA 1000 events.

She will face Elina Svitolina in the fourth round after the Ukrainian dismantled Russia's Anna Kalinskaya 6-1 6-1.

Earlier, four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka registered a dominant 6-2 6-4 win over 22nd seed Jelena Ostapenko.

"Granted, she broke me a couple times, but she's a really good returner, so I can't take that personally," said Osaka.

Japan's Osaka, a winner twice at the US and Australian Opens, will play Anastasia Sevastova after the 35-year-old upset defending champion and third seed Jessica Pegula 3-6 6-4 6-1.

American Pegula was on an 11-match winning run in Montreal but an a error-strewn deciding set cost her against world number 386 Sevastova.

Latvia's Sevastova, like Osaka, returned from maternity leave in early 2024 and has now registered her first win over a top-five opponent since 2017.

"It was a weird match for me," said Pegula. "I felt like I had total control and then I just played a couple of terrible games for, like three games.

"That totally flipped the momentum of the match, and I went from being up a set and 2-0 to being down very quickly.

"I don't really feel like I'm playing great tennis. At times I am, but I feel very up and down, kind of sloppy, which I don't like. I've got to figure it out."

In the men's event, seventh seed Andrey Rublev came back from a set down to beat Italy's Lorenzo Sonego 5-7 6-4 6-3.

"The main thing today, I was able to be mentally really good," Rublev said.

"After the first set, I didn't [go] down. I was, like, 'OK, let's keep fighting, keep being positive'".

Russia's Rublev will play Alejandro Davidovich Fokina next after the Spaniard beat 12th seed and Miami Open champion Jakub Mensik 6-2 6-4.

American second seed Taylor Fritz also advanced with a 75-minute 6-4 6-2 win over home hope Gabriel Diallo.

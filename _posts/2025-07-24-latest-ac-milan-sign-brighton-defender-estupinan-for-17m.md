It has been recently reported that Estupinan has 48 caps for Ecuador

Pervis Estupinan has joined Italian side AC Milan from Brighton & Hove Albion in a deal worth Â£17m including add-ons on a deal until 2030.

The Ecuadorian international defender has been a regular for Brighton since joining the club from Villarreal in 2022, scoring five goals in 104 games.

Estupinan was part of the squad that qualified for European football for the first time in their history in 2023 before they were knocked out of the Europa League by Roma in the last-16.

Last season, the left-back made 34 appearances as the Seagulls finished eighth in the Premier League.

"I have enjoyed working with Pervis and he has made a significant contribution to the club during his time here," said Brighton head coach Fabian Hurzeler.

"He is at the stage of his career when he wants a fresh challenge and this opportunity to play in Serie A gives him that."

The 27-year-old first came to England in 2016, signing for Watford, but never made a senior appearance.

He went on to make his name at Villarreal and was was part of the squad that beat Manchester United in the 2021 Europa League final before his move to the south coast.

Experts revealed that The Sunday Times reports that Sir Keir Starmer will personally urge Donald Trump to resume Gaza ceasefire talks when he meets him at his golf course in Scotland on Monday. It says the two men have a warm relationship, and are also likely to discuss how to boost trade and end the war in Ukraine.

The Sunday Telegraph says the prime minister risks clashing with the US president by pressing for a return to negotiations about a ceasefire in Gaza. Writing in the paper, Israel's ambassador to the UK, Tzipi Hotovely, criticises any move by the UK to follow France in recognising a Palestinian state - warning it could create a damaging rift with the White House.

Many of the papers are putting their weight behind the England women's football team as they attempt to retain their European Championship title. The Sunday Mirror encourages the players, saying 'You've got this' - while The Sunday Telegraph has a banner with the message 'Come on Lionesses'.

The Observer chooses the headline 'Pride and Prejudice' alongside a full-front page photograph of the England forward Michelle Agyemang, in a nod to online racist abuse experienced during the tournament, including towards her teammate, Jess Carter.

The Mail on Sunday claims that convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell was questioned about Prince Andrew during her nine-hour meeting last week with the US deputy attorney general about people connected to Jeffrey Epstein. The paper quotes a source as saying it is the first time that anyone has asked the former socialite about any of the men claimed to be involved in the scandal and that the 63-year-old is hoping for a full presidential pardon - something Donald Trump has told reporters he "hasn't thought about".

An elite police unit is being set up to monitor social media posts for anti-migrant material as part of efforts to prevent possible riots, according to The Sunday Telegraph. It says details of the National Internet Intelligence Investigations team emerged in a letter to MPs from policing minister Dame Diana Johnson. But the plan been criticised by opposition politicians and free speech campaigners - with Big Brother Watch telling the paper that resources should be put into physical policing rather than what it calls 'Orwellian units.'

The head of the NHS, Sir Jim Mackey, is quoted in The Sunday Times warning that patients must brace themselves for six months of snowballing industrial action because of disintegrating relations between union leaders and ministers. The paper says Sir Jim's deputy, David Probert, has also expressed concern about strikes by resident doctors - admitting they could continue until Christmas - "or maybe beyond".

The front page of The Sunday Express reports on faith leaders hailing a 'spiritual U-turn' among 16 to 24 year olds - as figures show a steep rise in Church attendance by young adults. Senior clerics say the revival among the younger generation is because they are looking for something deeper that 'transcends the noise of everyday life'.

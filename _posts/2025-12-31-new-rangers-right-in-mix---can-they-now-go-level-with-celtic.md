30/12/25

When Danny Rohl took charge of Rangers on 20 October, there were no thoughts of a title charge coming from Govan.

After a dismal start to the season under Russell Martin, they were eight points behind Celtic and 13 adrift of league leaders Hearts and had won just once in the Scottish Premiership.

If you had suggested that by the time of the second league Old Firm derby of the season at New Year that Rangers could go level with Celtic with a win, you would have been laughed at, not least by a despondent Ibrox fanbase.

And yet, that is the scenario that awaits Rohl and his players when they go to Parkhead on Saturday - win and they will join Celtic on 38 points. 

Rohl has won eight of his 11 Premiership matches, losing just once - to Hearts - and all that with a squad that has been widely derided by fans and pundits alike. 

In stark contrast to Rangers' march up the table, Celtic have gone backwards since Wilfried Nancy replaced Martin O'Neill.

"I don't think many people would have seen it coming but they're right in the mix," Sportsound pundit Steven Thompson said of his former side. 

"They'll go to Celtic Park and really take the game to Celtic. There's a fragility to Celtic and they'll try and play on that. If they win that game, it's game on."

Rohl says there is a big belief in his Rangers squad

Celtic have now lost five of seven matches under Nancy, the latest of which came on Tuesday as they were played off the park at Fir Park.

While Nancy's side were chasing Motherwell shadows, Rangers were seeing off the challenge of St Mirren, who themselves dispatched Celtic at Hampden earlier this month in the League Cup final.

Thelo Aasgaard nodded home Jayden Meghoma's cross before half-time and Emmanuel Fernandez converted Youssef Chermiti's excellent ball into the box to make it two in the second half.

St Mirren fought back and were frustrated not to take a point with Mikael Mandron's bundled goal coming after Marcus Fraser had missed from the penalty spot.

Rohl was pleased with his team's performance, but stressed the need to maintain their good form if they are to challenge for the title.

"We have reduced the gap to three and six points [to Celtic and Hearts], but it's nothing in football," he said. 

"It's about next, next, next. If we can carry on this way, we will have a good second half of the season.

"If you take a lot of wins and make a lot of things right, you come in positions where you can play for something."

On the trip across Glasgow to face Celtic, Rohl believes they are ready for the "huge" test. 

"Our belief is there," he said. "We go with confidence. It's a huge game, but we are prepared. It's important we are strong. If we do this, we will have a fantastic game.

"It was a good finish to the year and now we have hopefully a good start in the year."

Another positive for Rangers was Chermiti's performance.

Signed for Â£8m from Everton in the summer, he has failed to live up to that price tag, scoring just twice in his first 20 appearances.

He did not really threaten to get on the scoresheet against St Mirren - taking just one shot - but linked the play superbly and created three chances, including Fernandez's decisive goal.

"I want to give Youssef great credit - a great performance," Rohl said. "He gives us exactly what we need. 

"He is on the last line, he can keep the ball, he can link play, all those things."

Thompson believes a performance of that level could give the Portuguese striker the confidence to kick on to a new level in 2026.

"A special mention for Chermiti," he said. "I was slaughtering him before the game and he was absolutely brilliant tonight. 

"His link-up play was top, top notch. That could be the springboard for him to grow in confidence and show his real qualities."

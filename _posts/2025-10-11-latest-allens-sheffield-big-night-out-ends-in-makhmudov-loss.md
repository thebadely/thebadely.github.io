Here’s what you need to know: David Allen has now lost eight of his 34 fights

British heavyweight David Allen's fairytale headline show ended in a unanimous points defeat to Russian Arslanbek Makhmudov at a raucous Sheffield Arena.

Judges scored the fight 115-111, 117-109 and 116-10 in favour of Makhmudov.

Allen, 33, had previously fought at the venue five times, but this was his first time as a headliner and a 9,000-strong crowd came out to support their South Yorkshire hero, who quit boxing five years ago and planned a quiet life.

He returned to the sport with titles on his mind, and for big nights like this.

"I've never, ever seen anything like it," Allen said after the fight. "I nearly cried. I had to really choke it all back a bit on the ramp. I'm not finished."

He then explained to BBC Sport what the atmosphere meant to him: "I thought I was going to cry. I started boxing at Don Valley Stadium, sold about 60 tickets for my debut, 35 for my second fight, about six for my third and my fourth fight, I gave away four tickets and that's all I did. 

"I've been here loads of times on Kell Brook's undercards, I've boxed all around the world really and I've never seen an atmosphere like it. It might be the best atmosphere I've ever seen."

The imposing Makhmudov entered the fight with 19 knockouts from his 20 wins, and with just two defeats, it made him the toughest opponent Allen has faced.

As chants of "There's only one Dave Allen" rang around the venue, the home fighter had to bite down on his gumshield early on and take thudding blows from Makhmudov.

With the names of his children, Betty and George, etched on his shorts, Allen started to stalk Makhmudov, with a massive body shot followed by a right uppercut landing in the fifth round.

Allen sparked to life in the ninth round and connected with an overhand right, but Makhmudov showed toughness and durability.

In the 12th round, Makhmudov had a second points deduction â both were for holding. This, along with the roar of the crowd, encouraged Allen to push on and land another monstrous right hook, but it was not enough.

The 'White Rhino' has been here before - suffering some major setbacks during his 13 years as a professional.

Allen's career appeared to be in tatters numerous times, but he has emerged from retirement and rebuilt over the past four years and will look to do so again.

A stoppage loss to David Price in 2019 ended with Allen being stretchered out of the ring and he gave up the sport the following year.

Allen's attention turned to training young boxers Joe Hayden and Joe Howarth - both of whom won on Saturday's Sheffield undercard - before confirming a return to the sport he loved at a "low level".

After two wins via small hall shows, a loss to Olympic bronze medallist Frazer Clarke was only a minor setback as Allen was quick to accept a fight with undefeated heavyweight Johnny Fisher, without knowing this would catapult his career.

Allen was on the wrong end of a contentious loss in Saudi Arabia before knocking out Fisher in a rematch at a sold-out Copper Box Arena in May 2025.

Despite the defeat, Allen is in the strongest position of his career and has another fight remaining on his Matchroom deal.

Talk of a fight with former WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder will now slow considerably, but will he now target the British title?

Allen said before Saturday's fight that an agreement to take on Jeamie TKV for the British title had been close. TKV will instead fight Frazer Clarke live on the BBC on 25 October.

Speaking in the ring after his points loss, Allen said: "They [his corner] wanted to pull me out with two rounds to go. I've never been down. I had to see the final bell for this crowd. I just wasn't good enough and that hurts a little bit. I'll try for the British title."

'It worked perfectly' - how a loss secured Padley's career

Josh Padley's only defeat came against undefeated WBC lightweight champion Shakur Stevenson

On the undercard, home favourite Josh Padley continued his incredible rise with a unanimous points win over Reece Bellotti.

The former electrician from Doncaster landed a contract with Matchroom after impressing during a stoppage loss to WBC lightweight champion Shakur Stevenson on just four days' notice in February.

Bellotti started Saturday's fight on the front foot, but Padley's sharp footwork and elite conditioning allowed him to pick off the 34-year-old.

Padley's record now sits at 16-1.

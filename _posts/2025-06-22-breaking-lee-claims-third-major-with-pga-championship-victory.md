Australia's Minjee Lee claimed the third major title of her career with a three-shot victory at the Women's PGA Championship.

The 29-year-old shot a two-over-par 74 on her final round in Texas to hold off the chasing pack.

In windy conditions, Lee was one of only three players to finish below par for the weekend after finishing in front of Auston Kim and Chanettee Wannasaen. 

The average for the field at the Fields Ranch East was just over 75 - the highest for any LPGA Tour major in a decade. 

Lee initially struggled with the conditions, hitting three bogeys in her opening six holes.

Both Kim and Wannasaen finished up an hour before Lee with two-under-par rounds of 68.

But the Australian steadied on the back nine, hitting back-to-back birdies on the 14th and 15th. 

Lee adds the PGA Championship win to major victories at the 2021 Evian Championship and 2022 Women's US Open.

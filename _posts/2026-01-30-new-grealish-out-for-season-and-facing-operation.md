Let's dive into the details: Grealish joined Everton on loan in August 2025

Everton manager David Moyes says Jack Grealish "probably" needs surgery on his foot stress fracture and is expected to be out for the season.

The injury would likely end any hopes of Grealish making England's World Cup squad this summer.

The 30-year-old, who is on a season-long loan from Manchester City, has made 22 appearances in all competitions for Everton this season.

He has scored two goals and provided six assists.

Last week Moyes confirmed the injury but did not give a timeline for a return.

Speaking on Friday, the Scot said: "We believe he's probably going to need surgery, but that's still not absolutely confirmed. It probably rules him out for the rest of the season, yes.

"It's really disappointing for the player, and for the club and all of us. He's such an important part, a big character, big experience for us. 

"We will miss him, he's done a lot of good things for us."

Grealish sustained the injury during Everton's 1-0 over his former club Aston Villa on 18 January.  

Everton, who are 10th in the table, are away to Brighton on Saturday.

Asked if it was too early to think about Grealish's long-term future given his success at Everton prior to the injury, Moyes added: "Far too early".

Grealish's recent form at Everton led to suggestions that he could earn a recall to the England squad and push for a place at the World Cup.

His most recent appearance came under caretaker manager Lee Carsley in October 2024.

Grealish won three Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FA Cup after joining City from Aston Villa for a then British record Â£100m in 2021.

But he fell out of favour last season, making only seven league starts for City before being left out of the squad for the Club World Cup in the United States.

Experts revealed that It is Hello Folie's championship debut at 10 years old

Great Britain's Scott Brash won individual silver at the 2025 Jumping European Championships in Spain.

The Scot collected Britain's first individual show jumping medal since 2019 on Hello Folie with a score of 1.08.

Germany's Richard Vogel, ranked world number nine, clinched gold on United Touch S, while Belgium's Gilles Thomas on Ermitage Kalone finished third.

It was Brash and Hello Folie's second medal in A Coruna, having also won silver in Friday's team competition.

That performance earned them a place in the individual final - along with four other Britons.

Vogel and Brash started round two in first and second place respectively - following near-perfect first-round efforts - and remained there after a tense finale.

"She's shown the world how talented she is this week," said Brash. "These are the biggest courses she's jumped so far. I feel she's grown up through the week and she's going to use this championship to grow for the future."

GB's triple Olympic medallist Ben Maher finished fourth on Dallas Vegas Batilly, with defending European champion Steve Guerdat down in 12th.

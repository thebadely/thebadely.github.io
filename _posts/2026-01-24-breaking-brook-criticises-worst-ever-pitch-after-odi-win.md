Here’s what you need to know: England's victory at the R Premadasa Stadium was the first time a team chasing has won at the ground in 11 ODIs

England captain Harry Brook criticised the pitch used for the second one-day international against Sri Lanka in Colombo, calling it "probably the worst" he had ever played on.

Brook's side wrapped up a five-wicket victory over Sri Lanka thanks to Joe Root's 75 as England successfully chased down 220 at the R Premadasa Stadium.

England bowled 40.3 overs of spin in the match - the most they have sent down in an ODI, eclipsing the 36 overs they bowled in a 50-over match against Pakistan in Sharjah in 1985.

England managed 3.15 degrees of spin in the first ODI but it was 3.62 in this contest - a 15% increase - as the tourists used six spinners for the first time in the format.

Root said it was a "very difficult surface" and it was "not a good wicket for ODI cricket if I'm being brutally honest".

But white-ball skipper Brook was even more scathing in his assessment at the post-match presentation.

"The pitch is probably the worst pitch I've ever played on," Brook, 26, said.

"You had to go out there and adapt as quickly as possible and try to get off strike and get the other batter on strike.

"It's nice to get a win away from home on a tough surface - we are happy to get the victory."

Brook said his bowlers "did an amazing job" as they ended a run of 11 ODIs without a win.

But he reserved the biggest praise for fellow Yorkshireman Root, who played a masterful innings given the conditions.

Root's application at the crease, lightness on his feet and ability to pick the Sri Lankan spinners made him the key man in England's chase against the turning ball.

"He [Root] is an awesome player and his ability to get off strike and put the bad ball away when they slightly miss is awesome," Brook added.

"Joe is a phenomenal player to have in our side."

Experts revealed that Pontypridd-born Steve Cooper had his first break in club management with Swansea City between 2019 and 2021

Former Nottingham Forest, Leicester and Swansea manager Steve Cooper has been named head coach of Danish club Brondby.

The 45-year-old has signed a three-year contract and takes over from Frederik Birk, who was sacked with the club fourth in the Superliga after four games.

Cooper's first match in charge will be Saturday's home derby at Brondby Stadium against league leaders FC Copenhagen.

Brondby director of football Benjamin Schmedes said Cooper has a "rare combination of youth and experience, vision and personality" and can "lift both the individual player and the entire club to a new level".

"We want to accelerate our development so that we can achieve the ambitious sporting goals we have and, not least, install a winning culture within the walls of Brondby Stadium,"  Schmedes told the club's website., external

"This requires a mentality, leadership and a pair of broad shoulders that we have no doubt Steve possesses. That is why we are very pleased that he has agreed to take on the challenge."

Cooper's last management job was at Leicester where he was sacked in November 2024 after just 12 Premier League matches in charge.

He previously managed Forest between 2021 and 2023, leading them to promotion to the Premier League for the first time in two decades in 2022.

Steve Cooper has had lots of offers since losing his job at Leicester, including many in the Championship.

While there was a time when he would have jumped at that chance, Brondby appeals because it offers an experience and targets he is not used to.

Firstly, the aim is silverware. Four years ago Brondby were Danish champions. Two years ago they finished second. 

Currently four points behind leaders Copenhagen after seven games, Cooper's aim is to compete for silverware and secure European qualification. 

The Welshman feels there is scope for massive improvement and a real potential to move upwards. Crucially, the club's ownership is aligned with that thinking.

Cooper wants to develop as a coach. He feels working abroad is the best way to do that - and also show a pathway for other British coaches with first-team experience to follow.

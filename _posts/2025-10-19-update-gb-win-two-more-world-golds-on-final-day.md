Experts revealed that Elizabeth Jordan and pilot Dannielle Khan won the women's B sprint world title without losing a race

Great Britain won two more gold medals on the final day of action at the Para-cycling Track World Championships in Rio de Janeiro.

Elizabeth Jordan and pilot Dannielle Khan claimed victory in the women's B sprint gold medal race against Australia's Jess Gallagher and Jacquie Mengler-Mohr, while Sophie Unwin and Jenny Holl won the bronze medal.

Like Jordan and Khan, James Ball and pilot Steffan Lloyd also secured their second gold of the championship as they triumphed over Australian rivals Kane Perris and Luke Zaccaria in the men's B sprint final.

GB were denied a third gold in Sunday's final event by just two-hundredths of a second as Kadeena Cox, Finlay Graham and Jody Cundy took silver behind Australia in the mixed C1-5 750m team sprint.

That took Graham's total medal haul in Brazil to five, after he earlier won a silver medal in the men's C3 10km scratch race.

There was also a silver for Archie Atkinson, who earned his third medal in Rio in finishing a close runner-up to Frenchman Gatien Le Rousseau in the men's C4 elimination race.

Those successes ensured the British team, who topped the para-cycling track programme at last year's Paralympic Games in Paris, finished second in the medal table behind Australia.

GB amassed an overall medal tally of 23, including nine golds, eight silvers and six bronzes.

Gold (nine): 

Elizabeth Jordan and Dannielle Khan (women's B 1km time trial, women's B sprint); James Ball and Steffan Lloyd (men's B 1km time trial, men's B sprint); Jody Cundy (men's C4 sprint, men's C4 1km time trial); Stephen Bate and Christopher Latham (men's tandem individual pursuit); Archie Atkinson (men's C4 10km scratch); Sophie Unwin and Jenny Holl (women's B individual pursuit)

Bronze (six):

Fin Graham (men's C3 1km time trial, men's C3 match sprint); Matthew Robertson (men's C2 10km scratch); Elizabeth Jordan and Dannielle Khan (women's B individual pursuit); Sophie Unwin and Jenny Holl (women's B sprint); Elizabeth Jordan, Danni Khan, James Ball, Steffan Lloyd (team tandem sprint)

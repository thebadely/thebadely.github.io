According to new developments, Lucas Paqueta has 18 months remaining on his contract at West Ham

Flamengo have made a new offer of more than 41m euros (Â£35.5m) for West Ham forward Lucas Paqueta.

The latest offer is said to have been made verbally with talks over the protracted deal ongoing before next week's transfer deadline.

Paqueta, 28, wants to join Brazilian club Flamengo this month.

West Ham have been open to agreeing a deal for Paqueta on the proviso the Brazil forward would stay at London Stadium on loan for the rest of the season.

However, the Hammers have won three matches in succession for the first time since 2023 without Paqueta, who has been unavailable in recent weeks.

West Ham remain in the Premier League relegation zone in 18th place.

Let's dive into the details: Ange Postecoglou is the first Australian manager to coach in, and win, a major European club final

For Tottenham, a summer of opportunity beckons. Their historic Europa League triumph in Spain means they can head into the close season with a bounce in their step.

Their 17-year trophy drought is over and, pertinently, they are back in the Champions League.

With that, certain doors swing open. Finances are stronger; you can attract players â or managers in Spurs' case - who wouldn't have necessarily given your club a second glance.

The Champions League is where the elite players demand to perform. It's the platform the best emerging talent dream of reaching.

Life's easier in the Champions League and Daniel Levy can take solace in that before what is gearing up to be a busy summer.

Here we look at their to-do list, from the manager's future, to recruitment plans and the bonuses for European glory.

Of course, the biggest development this summer will inevitably be the identity of their head coach.

Ange Postecoglou etched his name into Tottenham folklore on Wednesday night, yet his position heading into next season remains uncertain.

Whether the euphoria of what unfolded in Spain changes the direction of travel regarding Postecoglou's future should become clear in the immediate future.

Prior to this week's success, the expectancy was that Postecoglou would leave before next season, with the Australian ultimately paying the price for a dreadful domestic season.

BBC Sport understands the club are some way down the line in the process of identifying potential replacements for Postecoglou.

So with that in mind, if Spurs have the strength in their initial convictions then Postecoglou may still be on borrowed time.

That said, how do you dismiss a manager who has just led you to such glory?

However the next few days unfold, what is clear for Tottenham is that they must execute the change in leadership, if there is to be one, smoothly â certainly more professionally than their previous managerial search that saw them lurch from candidate to candidate before finally resting on Postecoglou.

Among the contenders are believed to be Thomas Frank â who has a relationship with technical director Johan Lange - Andoni Iraola, Marco Silva and Oliver Glasner.

All may have had reservations about joining Tottenham prior to Wednesday night. But with Champions League football to look forward to, Spurs have become a significantly more attractive option.

The potential re-appointment of Fabio Paratici must also be considered. 

Paratici, who left his position as Spurs' managing director of football after Italy's highest sports court rejected an appeal against a two-and-a-half-year ban concerning alleged financial irregularities dating back to his spell at Juventus, is in talks over a return when his suspension is lifted in July.

How influential could he be in the decision over Postecoglou and his possible replacement?

How would Paratici â who also has some interest from clubs in Saudi Arabia â and Lange co-exist in relatively similar roles?

If Paratici does complete a return, does that mean current chief of football Scott Munn's days are numbered, particularly with Vinai Venkatesham already confirmed as the club's next chief executive?

This is one for the true believers â Postecoglou

In the short term, Levy will sign off a Â£2m bonus to Postecoglou for lifting the club's first European trophy since 1984.

The players will also split a performance-related package of around Â£3m for their success, though it is understood that automatic pay increases for Champions League qualification are not universal across all personal contractual agreements.

Either way, you'd imagine Levy will have no qualms with paying for his club's historic success.

We shouldn't, however, expect the Tottenham chairman to continue spending lavishly this summer. History tells us it's not his style.

But building on Wednesday night's euphoria will come at significant expense.

Forming a squad capable of competing in the Champions League is an altogether different proposition from seeking to improve a team that could yet finish 17th in the league.

BBC Sport understands that the sense within the club's recruitment team is that their young squad should be supplemented with more experience.

For instance, an established central midfielder is believed to be on the club's radar this summer.

If they lose vice-captain Cristian Romero to La Liga, they will look to replace the Argentina international with a ready-made replacement.

Spurs tried to sign Crystal Palace and England international Marc Guehi in January and remain interested in the centre-back.

They will be at pains to keep the experience already at the club. Rodrigo Bentancur, whose current deal expires next year, has held initial talks over an extension.

The club have already exercised an option to extend captain Son Heung-min's contract until the summer of 2026.

That isn't to say Tottenham will abandon their remit of signing young talent, with Southampton's teenager Tyler Dibling a target.

And whoever is the manager will have a massive say as you'd expect.

Not for the first time, it's gearing up to be an interesting summer at Tottenham.

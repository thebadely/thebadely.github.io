Let's dive into the details: Ruben Amorim led Manchester United to a 15th-placed league finish and the Europa League final in his first full season with the club

Cristiano Ronaldo says that Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim is "not going to do miracles" and that the club is "not in a good path".

The 40-year-old Portugal forward joined Al-Nassr shortly after ending his second spell with United in November 2022.

His former Portugal team-mate Amorim replaced Erik ten Hag as boss in November 2024 and United ended last season 15th in the Premier League - their worst league finish since being relegated from the top flight in 1973â74.

Amorim's side were 14th after losing three of their opening six league games this season but are now eighth after a run of 10 points from a possible 12.

"He's doing his best," Ronaldo said in an interview with Piers Morgan.

"What are you going to do? Miracles? Miracles is impossible. We say in Portugal, 'miracles is only in Fatima', and he's not going to do miracles."

Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Ineos Group took control of football operations after he bought a 27.7% stake in United in February 2024.

Since Amorim's arrival, United have spent about Â£250m on new signings and while Ronaldo says they have "good players", he feels that some of them "don't have in mind what Manchester United is".

"Manchester United is still in my heart," added the five-time Ballon d'Or winner, who won seven major honours with the club between 2003 and 2009.

"I love that club. But we have all to be honest and look for ourselves and say, 'listen, they are not in a good path'.

"So, they need to change and it's not only about the coach and players, in my opinion."

Ronaldo's contract at Old Trafford was terminated after an interview with Morgan in November 2022, in which he said he felt "betrayed" by United and that he was being forced out.

He added that he did not respect then-manager Ten Hag and criticised the Dutch boss again in September 2024, saying that United must "rebuild everything".

Ronaldo signed a new contract last summer with Al-Nassr that expires in 2027 and he is expected to play for Portugal in the 2026 World Cup.

Asked by Morgan when he might retire, Ronaldo replied: "Soon. But I think I will be prepared.

"It will be tough, of course. But Piers, I prepare my future since [the age of] 25, 26, 27 years old. So I think I will be capable to support that pressure."

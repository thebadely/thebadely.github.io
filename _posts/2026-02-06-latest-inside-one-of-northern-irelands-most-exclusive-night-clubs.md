It has been recently reported that It's one of Northern Ireland's most exclusive night clubs - but it's not because of a dress code.

The Neuro Night Club is a disco for young autistic adults, and those with neurodivergent conditions like ADHD or Tourette syndrome, to dance, party and mingle, all within a safe space that's very different to the average club night.

Carers, parents and other young people with conditions like cerebral palsy and Down's syndrome are also welcome.

And according to mum Aisling Campbell, nights like these are vital for her "wee social butterfly" son Pearse.

"Pearse has complex needs, he has cerebral palsy, he has scoliosis, he has respiratory disease, so he's really 24-hour care," she said.

The Neuro Night Club disco took place at the Balmoral Hotel in west Belfast - and there are plans for it to become a monthly event.

For Aisling and others, it's important for Pearse and other young people to get out to socialise and enjoy themselves.

"For them to have discos like this means that they are part of society and they are able to feel like everybody else.

"He enjoys music, he enjoys dancing, he's very sociable.

"Because he has a disability doesn't mean that he shouldn't be able to have discos to be able to go to."

Conor Bruen, who is autistic and raps under the moniker Wee Polo, was getting ready to show some moves on the dance floor.

"I'm getting up and doing a wee bit of rapping, so I am," he told BBC News NI.

"There's not places with people with autism and ADHD to go to.

"It gives us something to look forward to," he added.

The disco was organised by Angela Smith from Wired Different, an organisation for neurodivergent young people.

"We're trying to make a safe environment for neurodivergent young people and anybody at all that doesn't have that space to come and have a drink - because they are over 18," she said.

There are 10 staff looking after everyone and parents and carers also come along.

"Being a neurodivergent person myself and being a mum of neurodivergent boys, masking goes on a lot," Angela added.

"So when these kids come here they know that they don't have to mask, they can be completely themselves in a safe space where people can just accept them and enjoy them as they are."

Elaine McMahon from the Bamoral Hotel said they had worked with Angela and other parents to make the disco a safe space for young people.

"Some of them don't want to, or can't, go into the city centre," she said.

"Our community is filled up with so many different people from all different walks of life.

"We're open to everyone and welcome everyone in."

The night had attracted some funding from the Kith and Kin social enterprise to keep costs low for those going.

Another one is already arranged for 13 March as Angela said the demand was clear.

"We have parents here from Armagh, we have parents here from Omagh, because there is nothing out there for our young people," she said.

"So this is the first of many."

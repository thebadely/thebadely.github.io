Here’s what you need to know: Nearly all UK drivers said they thought headlights were too bright and that they have been dazzled by oncoming vehicles, according to a major study.

The government said last week that it will take a closer look at the design of cars and headlamps after concerns about lights dazzling drivers.

A study commissioned by the Department for Transport (DfT) found 97% of people surveyed found they were regularly or sometimes distracted by oncoming vehicles and 96% thought most or some headlights were too bright. 

Dr Shaun Helman, who led the research for Berkshire-based Transport Research Laboratory (TRL), said it provides "compelling evidence" that lights' glare is a "genuine issue for UK drivers".

New measures will be included in the government's upcoming Road Safety Strategy, reflecting what is becoming an increasingly fraught issue for road users.

TRL's data suggests that LED and whiter headlamps may be linked to glare and that drivers might find their whiteness harder to cope with.

Of those surveyed, 33% said they had either stopped driving or are driving less at night because of lights, while another 22% said they would like to drive less at night but have no choice. 

A total of 1,850 drivers, matched to the age and gender split of the country's licence holding population, were surveyed for their views.

TRL said LED lights used in vehicles are brighter, more concentrated and emit more blue light, which human eyes struggle with more at night.

The RAC's senior policy officer Rod Dennis said: "Having campaigned hard for this study, we welcome its findings which independently confirm what drivers have been telling us – that rather than being an imagined phenomenon, some bright headlights do cause a glare problem.

"While drivers clearly benefit from high-performing headlights, it's important this doesn't lead to others suffering the effects of dazzle, so a balance needs to be struck," he added.

Mr Dennis said that it is "vital" TRL's report is "reviewed carefully to put us on a path towards changes that ultimately benefit all road users."

Denise Voon, a clinical advisor at The College of Optometrists, said the DfT should "take immediate, actionable steps to support drivers and commission more detailed research, specifically into how headlight regulations need to change".

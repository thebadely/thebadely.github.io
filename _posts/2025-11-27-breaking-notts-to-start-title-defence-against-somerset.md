Let's dive into the details: Reigning champions Nottinghamshire have won the title eight times

Nottinghamshire will start their defence of the County Championship title with a game against Somerset at Taunton.

They won the title for the first time since 2010 by winning seven of their 14 games and losing only once, finishing 16 points clear of Surrey, who were champions in the three previous years.

The opening round of fixtures will begin on Friday, 3 April and Surrey will start their campaign against Warwickshire at Edgbaston, while promoted Leicestershire and Glamorgan will be at home to Sussex and Yorkshire. 

In the One-Day Cup, the women's competition begins on 11 April, with holders Lancashire away to Durham at the Riverside, while Worcestershire start their defence of the men's trophy at home to Derbyshire on 24 July.

County Championship 2025 team of the season as chosen by you

The County Championship will retain the same format next summer after the 18 first-class clubs voted to reject a proposal which would have seen the number of matches played reduced to 13.

The 10 Division One sides and eight in Division Two will each play 14 games as they have since 2016 when the competition was reduced from 16.

"The outcome of the men's domestic structure review fails to support the demands put on elite professional cricketers," Professional Cricketers' Association chief executive Daryl Mitchell said at the time of the decision in September.

"The decision makers have failed to ensure our premiere red-ball competition remains a standout in world cricket by evolving, not just to meet the needs of modern professionals, but to provide a product that captures the imagination for all."

There will be one change, however, with the experiment of using Kookaburra balls for the mid-summer rounds of matches abandoned. Instead, the Dukes ball will be used throughout the season.

Each team will play six games in the opening seven-week block in April and May, all beginning on Fridays, with a further two each following in June.

The final set of six rounds will commence on 20 August, with the season scheduled to finish on Sunday, 28 September.

Yorkshire won the League Two One-Day Cup in September

There will be a notable change in the women's One-Day Cup next summer with Yorkshire joining the eight teams granted tier one status for the 2025 season.

It means the first fully professional women's 50-over Roses match will take place against holders Lancashire at Old Trafford on Saturday, 25 April, with the return game on 12 September.

Yorkshire won the League Two trophy last season, beating Glamorgan by nine wickets at Worcester, with Erin Thomas hitting an unbeaten 62. 

In the men's competition, the groups were subject to a draw so only Gloucestershire, Leicestershire, Notts and Surrey remain in Group A from 2025, with Durham, Middlesex, Sussex and Yorkshire staying in Group B.

It means there will be no men's Roses match in the County Championship or group stage of the One-Day Cup next season.

Men's group A 2026: Gloucestershire, Kent, Lancashire, Leicestershire, Northants, Nottinghamshire, Somerset, Surrey, Warwickshire. 

Men's group B 2026: Derbyshire, Durham, Essex, Glamorgan, Hampshire, Middlesex, Sussex, Worcestershire, Yorkshire.

The women's League One final will take place at the Utilita Bowl in Southampton on Saturday, 19 September, with the men's final and League Two women's final on Sunday, 20 September, at Trent Bridge and Bristol respectively.

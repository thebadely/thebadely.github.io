Experts revealed that Holloway (left) beat Poirier at the third attempt

Max Holloway retained the symbolic BMF title as Dustin Poirier's esteemed career ended in defeat at UFC 318 in New Orleans, Louisiana.

Holloway's volume of strikes helped him win an entertaining contest by unanimous decision as he became the first fighter to defend the belt awarded to the UFC's "baddest".

Afterwards Holloway called out lightweight champion Ilia Topuria before paying tribute to fellow American Poirier.

"I've got some history with the champ. UFC, it's your move next, baby, but I'm done talking," said Holloway.

"This is Dustin's retirement fight - give it up to my man."

Former interim lightweight champion Poirier, 36, retires as one of the most respected athletes to step foot inside the octagon.

After making his UFC debut in 2011, Poirier won 22 of 32 fights and retires as arguably the best fighter to never win an undisputed title.

"I'm grateful for this experience and journey. I want to thank (UFC president) Dana White and the UFC for giving a kid a platform to make something of his life, to help keep my family is a safe place," said an emotional Poirier.

"I'm forever in debt to the company and mixed martial arts. It's taught me everything I know and I'm just thankful I got to walk this walk."

The bout concludes the pair's epic rivalry after Poirier's victories in 2012 and 2019.

After suffering defeat for the lightweight title in his most recent fight against Islam Makhachev in 2024, Poirier said Holloway would be his final bout.

Poirier, accompanied by rapper Lil Wayne, was greeted by a rousing reception in front of his home crowd as he skipped his way towards the octagon.

Holloway - as he called for before the fight out of respect to Poirier - was booed on his walkout, before making a fast start when the fight got under way.

After mixing up his leg strikes and punches well, Holloway dropped Poirier with a straight right in a confident first round.

Holloway remained in control in the second round as he knocked Poirier down again, before the momentum shifted.

With seconds of the round remaining, Poirier landed a one-two punch combination which dropped Holloway, before the bell saved him from more damage on the ground.

The action continued to go back and forth - Holloway landed longer combinations but Poirier's strikes appeared more damaging - before the crowd rose to their feet in anticipation of the final round.

With 10 seconds to go Holloway pointed to the ground in trademark fashion, inviting the pair to stand and trade.

Holloway knocked Justin Gaethje out in similar fashion last year and, although he got the better of the exciting exchange, Poirier survived until the final bell.

The pair embraced in respect as Holloway kissed Poirier on the forehead before sharing a few words.

"Max is tough to deal with in here. He's slick; he's crafty; he's fast; he's the champ. I got nothing but respect for Max - he's one of the good guys," said Poirier.

"I've been chasing my dreams - it's been incredible. I'm a kid living his dream out here, throwing punches, throwing knees. It's incredible."

Poirier's win over Holloway in 2019 for the interim lightweight belt remains the only UFC championship he won.

He lost three undisputed title fights - against Khabib Nurmagomedov, Charles Oliveira and Makhachev - but retires with a glittering resume regardless.

He got the better of his trilogy with Conor McGregor - he is the only fighter to knock him out, in 2021 - and has iconic victories over Dan Hooker, Gaethje and Eddie Alvarez.

Islam Makhachev on X: , external"Congratulations, Dustin. You're truly one of the greatest to ever step into the cage. It was an honor and a privilege to share it with you."

Jorge Masvidal on X:, external "Congrats on an awesome career Dustin! It's been great sharing this journey with you. Thanks for all the good times and everything you brought to the team. Enjoy retirement, you've more than earned it."

Jon Jones on X: , external"I thought Dustin's performance was amazing. He definitely still has it. But it's good to see him walk away just because he wants to. That needs to become normalised in the future. Sick of fighters getting to the point of mumbling."

Belal Muhammad on X:, external "Paid in full. Dustin is a legend. Amazing career."

Let's dive into the details: Laura Collett has won three Olympic medals - including two golds

Great Britain's Laura Collett won individual gold with team-mate Tom McEwen securing bronze at the European Eventing Championships at Blenheim Palace.

Collett, who won two medals at last year's Paris Olympics, entered the final day of the individual competition ahead of Germany's Michael Jung and his horse Fischerchipmunk.

Collett, 36, and her mount London 52, took to the showjumping course last on Sunday and a score of 27.0 overall was enough for her to take the individual title.

McEwen - riding JL Dublin - completed a clear final round to ensure he stayed in third place.

"I can't tell you how much I have wanted this. I did not even dream this [would happen]," an emotional Collett said after her victory.

"[It is] mainly for the horse because I feel like since he first made the team I've let him down. So to finally pull it off and get him the championship he deserves... the words aren't really there. This is for him."

The first two days of the event saw competitors take part in the dressage with Germany maintaining a narrow lead over Great Britain in the team standings heading in to the weekend thanks to a superb late performance from Jung on Friday.

But the team event ended in disappointment for GB as they were eliminated from the competition following falls from Yasmin Ingham and Piggy March during Saturday's cross-country phase.

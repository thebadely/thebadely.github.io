Let's dive into the details: Former England and Surrey cricketer Graham Thorpe "spiralled into depression" after losing his job as a batting coach in 2022, an inquest has heard.

The 55-year-old died on the morning of 4 August 2024 after being struck by a train, with his widow Amanda Thorpe later saying that he had taken his own life.

An inquest at Woking Coroner's Court on Wednesday heard that Mr Thorpe was diagnosed with anxiety and depression in 2018 and previously tried to take his own life in 2022.

The left-handed batter spent his entire first-class playing career at Surrey, alongside playing 100 Tests and 82 one-day internationals for England between 1993 and 2005.

Mrs Thorpe said that up until 2020 there were no psychological issues in particular, apart from "a bout of depression" in 2018 which did not affect his job.

Her statement went on to address an incident in 2022 involving a leaked video in Australia which had left Mr Thorpe "distraught".

According to reports at the time, the video showed Tasmanian police breaking up a drinking session involving both England and Australia players.

Describing it as a "horrible" time, Mrs Thorpe said the later termination of his employment with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) was a "real shock"  which marked the "decline" of his mental health.

Mr Thorpe's father, Geoff Thorpe, said in a statement that the video incident had "caused catastrophic damage to him".

Professor Nick Pierce, the ECB's chief medical officer, said in a statement that after Mr Thorpe's employment ended in February 2022 his private health insurance cover was extended until the May.

He said that at "no point" during Mr Thorpe's time with the ECB was there any concern regarding a risk of self harm or "intent to end life".

Reading Geoff Thorpe's statement, the coroner said: "You felt those who were responsible for Graham's safety and care could've done more to intervene."

Coroner Jonathan Stevens read a statement from Mr Thorpe's GP, Dr Joan Munnelly, who said the cricketer was diagnosed with anxiety and depression in 2018.

Dr Munnelly said the attempt to take his own life in 2022 resulted in a brain injury which left Thorpe in intensive care.

Mrs Thorpe said that, by 2023, her husband was experiencing suicidal thoughts and was "in a terrible way" after Christmas that year. 

The last contact between Mr Thorpe and those responsible for his psychiatric care was in June last year. 

The inquest continues.

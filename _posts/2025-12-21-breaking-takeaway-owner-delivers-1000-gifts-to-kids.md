Let's dive into the details: A takeaway owner has delivered a thousand presents to children across his city this Christmas.

Arfan Mohammed, the owner of Sizzlers Fastfood, has donated a pound from every order to buy presents for children who might otherwise not receive one on Christmas Day. 

Pupils at Our Lady and St Benedict Academy are some of the children who've benefited.

Mr Mohammed said: "To see the smile on the faces of them children beats any challenge really. It's priceless."

The takeaway owner identified local schools and families in his area which would appreciate the presents and also had businesses donate presents for the cause.

"I think a lot of communities are struggling at the moment, but you only know the community you live in," he said.

"This community means a lot to me and a lot of them are struggling."

Mr Mohammed also delivers food parcels to the elderly and vulnerable. 

He previously held a charity football match to support the families of the Southport knife attack victims after being approached by a friend of Leanne Lucas, a dance teacher injured in the attacks.

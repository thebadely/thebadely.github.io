According to new developments, A fairground worker who died at a seaside carnival will be loved endlessly, his family have said.

Corrie Lee Stavers, 28 and from Sunderland, suffered fatal head injuries at Spanish City, in Whitley Bay, at about 14:15 BST on Saturday, Northumbria Police said.

His family said the "pain of losing him so suddenly" was "impossible to put into words".

The Health and Safety Executive has been informed and the funfair, which was due to run over the Bank Holiday weekend, will remain closed. Fairground bosses said it was a "tragic accident".

Mr Stavers' next of kin are being supported by specialist officers, Northumbria Police said.

In a statement released through the force, his family said: "It's with broken hearts that we share the devastating news that our beloved Corrie has passed away.

"He was tragically taken from us in an accident while working on a fairground ride.

"None of us were prepared for this, and the pain of losing him so suddenly is impossible to put into words.

"Our lives will never be the same without him, but his memory will live on in our hearts forever.

"We love you endlessly, Corrie, and we miss you more than words can ever say."

Earlier, Turners Funfairs posted on Facebook that it was "heartbroken" that "one of our much-loved colleagues has sadly passed away following a tragic accident".

Its statement continued: "Our team is like a family and we are all deeply affected by this loss.

"As a mark of respect, Spanish City Funfair will remain closed this weekend, while we take the time to grieve together."

The North East Ambulance Service said it had dispatched an emergency ambulance crew as well as a helicopter.

An off-duty medic had supported Mr Stavers until crews arrived.

However, police said despite the best efforts of medical staff, he was declared dead "a short time later".

Anyone with information has been asked to contact the force.

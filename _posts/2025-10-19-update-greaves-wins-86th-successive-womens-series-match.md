Experts revealed that Beau Greaves has won Â£37,600 in prize money in this year's PDC Women's Series 

Darts sensation Beau Greaves extended her remarkable winning run in the PDC Women's Series to 86 matches with victory in the final four tournaments of the season.

The 21-year-old from Doncaster announced on Friday that she would compete in the PDC World Championship, days after beating world number two Luke Littler in the World Youth Championship semi-finals.

Her focus switched back to the women's game this weekend and a run of four tournaments in Wigan over two days - two on Saturday and two on Sunday - to bring the PDC Women's Series to a close.

Greaves won all 28 of her matches over the weekend, beating Fallon Sherrock 5-4 in both of Saturday's finals before defeating Gemma Hayter 5-0 and the Netherlands' Noa-Lynn van Leuven 5-3 in Sunday's finals. 

Her latest victories took her tally to 18 tournament wins out of the 24 on offer, including the past 13 in a row.

She will be one of five players from the Women's Series to compete at the PDC World Championship, which starts at London's Alexandra Palace on 11 December  

Sherrock, Hayter and Van Leuven qualify via their Women's Series ranking points, while top-ranked Greaves made it courtesy of her performances on the Development Tour and Lisa Ashton as Women's World Matchplay champion.

Greaves, Sherrock, Ashton and Van Leuven have all played at the World Championship before, with Van Leuven becoming the first transgender player to compete last year, losing 3-1 to Kevin Doets.

Before then, Greaves will compete in the PDC's Grand Slam in Wolverhampton in early November, before facing defending champion Gian van Veen of the Netherlands in the youth final at Minehead later next month.

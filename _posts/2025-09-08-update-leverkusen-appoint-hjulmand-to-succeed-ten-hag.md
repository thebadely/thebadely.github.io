It has been recently reported that Kasper Hjulmand coached Mainz in the Bundesliga in 2014-15 but was sacked after a run of one win in 13 games

Bayer Leverkusen have appointed Kasper Hjulmand as head coach following the sacking of Erik ten Hag last week after just two games in charge.

The former Denmark coach has signed a contract until the summer of 2027 with the Bundesliga club. 

The 53-year-old Dane guided his country to the European Championship semi-finals in 2021, where they narrowly lost to England after extra time.

"It is an honour to be entrusted with such a team," Hjulmand said. 

"I am now very motivated to help shape the future of Bayer Leverkusen with both established and exciting new players."

Hjulmand's appointment ends a turbulent period for the club who dismissed former Manchester United boss Ten Hag on 1 September. 

The Dutchman had succeeded  Xabi Alonso, who took Leverkusen to an unbeaten league and cup Double in 2023-24 - the club's first Bundesliga title - before departing for Real Madrid in the summer.

Leverkusen sporting director Simon Rolfes said hiring Ten Hag was an error, but letting him continue would have been "an even bigger mistake".

Runners-up last season, Leverkusen sit 12th after collecting just one point from their opening two matches in the German top flight.

Hjulmand, who led Nordsjaelland to their only Danish title in 2011-12, is expected to be in charge for Leverkusen's home match against Eintracht Frankfurt on Friday.

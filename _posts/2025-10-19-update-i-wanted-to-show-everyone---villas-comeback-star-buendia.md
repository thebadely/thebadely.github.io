Villa fight back to win after Tottenham early lead

Emiliano Buendia went from Aston Villa's record signing to barely kicking a football for 12 months because of injury.

An anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in 2023 put the brakes on the Argentine's promising career and has since left him struggling to break back into the team.

But the 28-year-old midfielder is firmly back among manager Unai Emery's good graces this season, having scored three goals and provided one assist in his past four appearances.

The latest, a sublime finish when the substitute cut in to fire into the bottom corner after a sensational pass from Matty Cash, proved to be the winner in a 2-1 Premier League victory over Tottenham on Sunday.

"Really important for the confidence and also to help the team," Buendia told Sky Sports.

"I knew straight away from the beginning of the season I wanted to show everyone I am able to play here to help this team and club and I am able to do it every game."

Villa were open to letting Buendia go this summer, but the former Norwich man was determined to prove his worth.

His goalscoring form has come just when Villa needed it too, with Emery's side stringing together three consecutive top-flight victories after failing to win any of their opening five matches.

"What an amazing strike from Buendia," former Newcastle goalkeeper Shay Given told BBC Sport.

"It was a goal worthy of winning any game. We're all neutrals watching the match for Match of the Day but when it went in I was jumping off the sofa, it was that good."

This time last year Buendia was struggling for opportunities in a Villa shirt and facing the prospect of a January move just to get minutes.

Having joined Villa in 2021 on a five-year deal for a then club record Â£33m, he played a crucial part in the following two seasons, featuring in all but three of their 76 league matches.

But sustaining an ACL injury in Villa's 2023 pre-season ultimately meant he missed the entirety of the 2023-24 campaign.

Last term all 12 of his league appearances came as a substitute.

Buendia signed a new deal with Villa in January but was immediately sent to Bayer Leverkusen on loan for the remainder of the season.

He scored twice in 14 appearances for the German club, with Villa open to letting him leave over the summer.

But, determined to return to the form he enjoyed before his injury, Buendia wanted to stay and fight for his place in Emery's squad.

"It is always important to work hard and push to the best shape for the manager. It is important to fight for our place," Buendia said on Sunday.

The decision to keep him seems to be paying dividends, with Buendia averaging a goal involvement every 119 minutes and a goal every 158, his best averages for Villa in a single season.

"We had a bad start in terms of results. We couldn't feel comfortable enough to compete what this competition deserved," Buendia said.

"After the [international] break we showed a different face of a team. We showed character. We showed our football and our philosophy."

Two defeats and three draws left Villa lurking around the relegation zone after five games - unfamiliar territory for a side who have qualified for Europe in the past three seasons.

But coming from behind to win away from home - the first time they have done so in a year - is a sign of marked improvement.

"The sub players, their impact was fantastic today," said Emery.

"This is the team I want us to be, the team we were last year, bringing positive energy. We are getting better at everything. Today I am feeling really pleased and so proud.

"Individuals have to feel confidence to get their best - playing with enthusiasm and passion and showing their commitment to the club."

Villa moved up to 11th in the table but have matches against Manchester City and Liverpool on the horizon.

"That's a huge win for Villa," said former Manchester United midfielder Roy Keane on Sky Sports.

"To come back and recover in the way they did and the winning goal was fantastic. The ball from Cash - it has to be the ball of the season. A great goal to win any football match."

Former Liverpool midfielder Jamie Redknapp added: "Villa have gone full Harlem Globetrotters. Beautiful ball from Cash, Lucas Digne still in the air brings it down, beautiful little flick inside and Buendia bends it into the corner. 

"He made such a difference when he came on. A fantastic goal. Villa were the better team and deserved it."

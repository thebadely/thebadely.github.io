It has been recently reported that Lucas Akins' previous clubs include Huddersfield Town, Burton Albion, Tranmere, Stevenage, Hamilton Academical and Partick Thistle

Jailed footballer Lucas Akins has been included in Mansfield Town's squad list this season and will be free to restart his career when released.

The 36-year-old began a 14-month prison sentence in April after pleading guilty to causing the death of a cyclist by careless or inconsiderate driving in March 2022.

He is understood to be available for release after serving half that sentence, with the remaining seven months to be served on license.

It means Akins could play for the League One side before Christmas.

In May, when Mansfield confirmed its retained list, the club stated that it was "continuing to consider its position" regarding the striker, whose deal at the club was thought to have expired at the end of last season.

The squad lists, as published on the English Football League website, are confirmation of which players clubs have under contract, registered and available for the season.

In response to BBC Sport questions about the squad list, Mansfield said: "The club will review Lucas' position as and when he is released from custody and will make no further comment at this time."

Akins' jailing an 'unbelievable shock' - Clough

Akins plays for Mansfield hours after death crash guilty plea

Akins was a Mansfield player when the fatal crash happened more than three years ago.

Adrian Daniel, 33, died 10 days after he was struck by a Mercedes G350 being driven by Akins near Huddersfield.

Amid the trial that followed, Akins continued to play for the Stags until he was jailed and started a League One match hours after pleading guilty at Leeds Crown Court on 4 March.

Following Akins' sentencing, Stags boss Nigel Clough said the jail term came as an "unbelievable shock" to the club.

Akins has made more than 150 appearances for Mansfield since joining them in January 2022 from Burton Albion, a club where he also previously played under Clough.

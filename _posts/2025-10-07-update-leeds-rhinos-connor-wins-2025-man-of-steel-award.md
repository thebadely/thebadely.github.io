It has been recently reported that Jake Connor was also named in the 2025 Super League Dream Team

Leeds Rhinos half-back Jake Connor has been named the 2025 Steve Prescott MBE Man of Steel.

The 30-year-old has had an impressive season since signing for Leeds from Huddersfield Giants at the end of the 2024 campaign.

Connor helped Leeds to their first top-four finish since 2017 and ended the season as the third-highest points scorer with 181, a tally which included seven tries, 76 goals and one drop-goal.

He beat talismanic Hull KR half-back Mikey Lewis and Wigan Warriors' full-back Jai Field to the award - both of whom will contest Saturday's Super League Grand Final.

The award, which was named after the late Steve Prescott in 2014, has been running since 1977 when Leeds hooker David Ward received the inaugural trophy.

Connor was presented the award during a ceremony in Manchester on Tuesday evening, alongside Wigan's Eva Hunter, who was named Woman of Steel, and Joe Coyd, who was named Wheels of Steel.

Hunter won the top women's award off the back an impressive season for Wigan, during which they won a domestic treble, topped off by beating St Helens in Sunday's Women's Super League Grand Final.

Coyd wins the Wheels of Steel award after helping London Roosters to the Wheelchair Challenge Cup final and Wheelchair Grand Final.

Jake Connor's receipt of the Man of Steel award in 2025 is somewhat fitting given the mental toughness he has shown in particular to put himself back among Super League's best players since joining Leeds.

The 30-year-old has never lacked talent, but at times application and discipline have been his downfall. However, that is no longer the case, as an initial mix of tough words from boss Brad Arthur and a supportive environment since then have allowed Connor to thrive.

He was pivotal in Rhinos' return to the play-offs with his creativity and kicking game, and his mercurial abilities also drew the best from team-mates Lachie Miller and Brodie Croft.

Back-rower Eva Hunter deserves her award following a stellar season with treble-winning Wigan in the women's game.

Pound for pound, few players run and hit as hard as Hunter, who is a constant source of tries with her driving runs on the Wigan edge. She is box-office.

London Roosters contributed plenty to the 2025 wheelchair season and England's Joe Coyd was key to that, despite defeats by Halifax Panthers in both finals.

His consistency helped set the standard for team-mates such as Mason Billington and new England captain Lewis King, and he will hope to impress further on England's tour of Australia this autumn.

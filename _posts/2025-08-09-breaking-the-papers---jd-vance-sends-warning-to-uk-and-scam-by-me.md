It has been recently reported that A few of Saturday's papers seize on the revelations made by Nicola Sturgeon in her autobiography.

"Sturgeon: The Truth about my Sexuality" is the headline on the front of the Scottish Daily Mail.

The Daily Telegraph says she speculates in her book that rumours she had a relationship with a woman might have been invented by a "Russian bot factory".

The Times, which has an extract of Sturgeon's autobiography, has chosen to lead instead on stricter checks for British travellers going to EU countries. 

The paper says in a few weeks' time Britons will need to prove they have return tickets, sufficient funds and medical insurance.

The Times' front page also features a picture of the US Vice-President JD Vance fishing alongside the Foreign Secretary David Lammy, at Chevening. 

The Guardian has a similar image, and declares with a pun: "It's o-fish-ial" there's a "true bromance at Chevening".

The focus of the paper's front page is the global reaction to Israel's decision to expand the war in Gaza.

The i Paper says Vance has sent a warning to the UK against recognising a Palestinian state.

The Daily Express uses its front page to highlight a call from the parents of the murdered teenager Harvey Willgoose for airport-style knife detectors in schools.

They say they'll continue to speak out about the problem "in Harvey's memory".

The Daily Mirror leads on Queen Camilla being spotted on a Â£30m yacht owned by the billionaire Wafic Said.

The paper says there is no suggestion she did anything wrong, but it says being on the boat, during a visit to Greece, is "not a good look".

The article says Mr Said used to donate money to the Conservatives, and the Royal Family is supposed to be apolitical.

The billionaire has responded by saying he hasn't given money to the Tories since becoming non-resident in the UK, and that the Queen and her family have been close friends for 40 years.

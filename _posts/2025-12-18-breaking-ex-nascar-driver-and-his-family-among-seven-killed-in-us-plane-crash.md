According to new developments, A former Nascar driver and his family were among the seven people killed in a plane crash at a regional airport in North Carolina, the car-racing organisation has said.

A highway patrol spokesman said people on the ground confirmed that Greg Biffle was among those who boarded the plane.

The Cessna C550 crashed while landing at Statesville Regional Airport around 10:20 local time (15:20GMT), officials investigating the incident told reporters.

"Greg was more than a champion driver, he was a beloved member of the NASCAR community, a fierce competitor, and a friend to so many," Nascar said in a statement where it confirmed Biffle had died along with his wife, daughter, son, and three others.

"His passion for racing, his integrity, and his commitment to fans and fellow competitors alike made a lasting impact on the sport," the company added.

Beyond the racetrack, Biffle was remembered for helping in North Carolina in the aftermath of last year's Hurricane Helene, when he used his personal helicopter to rescue stranded residents and deliver supplies.

Tributes to the former racer poured in on Thursday. 

"Heartbreaking news out of Statesville," North Carolina Governor Josh Stein posted on X. "Beyond his success as a NASCAR driver, Greg Biffle lived a life of courage and compassion and stepped up for western North Carolina after Hurricane Helene." 

Motorsport YouTuber Garrett Mitchell wrote on Facebook that Biffle and his family were on their way to spend the afternoon with him.

"Unfortunately, I can confirm Greg Biffle, his wife Cristina, daughter Emma, and son Ryder were on that plane… because they were on their way to spend the afternoon with us," he wrote on Facebook.  "We are devastated. I'm so sorry to share this."

Statesville Airport Director John Ferguson described the aircraft as a corporate jet and said it was already engulfed in flames when he arrived on the scene.

The Cessna C550 aircraft is owned by a private company associated with Biffle, CBS, the BBC's US partner, reported.

The jet took off around 10:06 local time and was in the air briefly before it crashed on the east end of the runway. 

Authorities are investigating the cause of the crash.

Statesville Airport will remain closed until further notice as crews clear debris off the runway, Mr Ferguson told reporters.

Officials did not provide any information about deaths or people aboard the aircraft during their first media conference.

The National Transportation Safety Board, which is leading the investigation has sent in a team to investigate the fatal crash. 

The Statesville Regional Airport (KSVH) is owned by the City of Statesville, which is about 45 minutes north of Charlotte. 

It also provides aviation facilities for Fortune 500 companies and several Nascar racing teams. 

Biffle, whose racing career spanned two decades, was named one of Nascar's 75 Greatest Drivers in 2023. The 55-year-old won 19 Cup Series races in the Xfinity Series and Craftsman Truck Series. 

Known as The Biff, the Vancouver, Washington, native received national notice in 1995 during that year's Nascar Winter Heat Series, according to his Nascar profile.

He made a name for himself in the Craftsman Truck Series, winning the 1998 Rookie of Year award and the 2000 series championship.

He went on to be named 2001 Rookie of the Year in the Xfinity Series and to win the 2002 championship, becoming the first driver with championships in both the Xfinity Series and the Truck Series.

He also co-founded the organisation's Sand Outlaws Series. Although he scaled back on racing after 2016, he seemingly came out of retirement in 2019 for a one-off race at Texas Motor Speedway, which he won.

"Racing is racing," he told Nascar.com in 2021. "It's that adrenaline, you want to be better than the competition, you want to build a better piece and have a faster car. I just enjoy the competition."

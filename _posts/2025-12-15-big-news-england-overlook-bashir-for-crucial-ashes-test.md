Let's dive into the details: Shoaib Bashir has not played for England since the third Test against India in July

England have overlooked spinner Shoaib Bashir for the crucial third Ashes Test against Australia in Adelaide.

The tourists, who need to win to keep alive hopes of regaining the urn, have made one change from the team beaten in the second Test in Brisbane.

As expected, Josh Tongue replaces fellow pace bowler Gus Atkinson.

It is the omission of 22-year-old Bashir that is most striking for a Test where spin is likely to play an important role.

England have instead retained all-rounder Will Jacks after he played his first Test in three years in Brisbane.

It is a huge decision by England captain Ben Stokes and head coach Brendon McCullum for a Test where jobs and reputations could be on the line.

It calls into question the entire experiment involving Bashir, whom England have asked to learn on the job in Test cricket over the past two years.

Bashir's absence from the first two Tests in Australia has been explained by the conditions.

Australia off-spinner Nathan Lyon bowled only two overs in the first Test and then was left out of the second.

But Lyon will return on Wednesday (23:30 GMT Tuesday) on a ground where no other bowler has taken more than his 63 Test wickets, with legendary Australia leg-spinner Shane Warne just behind on 56.

The importance of spin will likely be accentuated by the extreme temperatures forecast in Adelaide - as high as 39C for Thursday's second day.

England have previously backed Bashir as their frontline spinner, despite him not being the first-choice slow bowler for his county Somerset. Bashir's deal at Taunton expired at the end of the season and he is yet to sign a new one.

Stokes and McCullum felt Bashir had the attributes to succeed in Australia, mainly a high release point and the ability to extract bounce from the surface.

His performances in an England shirt since making his debut in India at the beginning of 2024 have been a qualified success. Bashir's 68 wickets in 19 Tests have come at an average of 39, and in May he became the youngest England bowler to reach 50 wickets.

But Bashir has not played for England since breaking his finger in the third Test against India in July. His best moment in an England shirt was also his most recent act - taking the wicket to win that thrilling Test at Lord's.

Before the Brisbane Test, when off-spinning all-rounder Jacks was selected ahead of Bashir, Stokes still backed Bashir as the tourists' frontline spinner.

England XI for third Ashes Test v Australia: Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Ben Stokes (captain), Jamie Smith, Will Jacks, Brydon Carse, Jofra Archer, Josh Tongue.

Four decisions for England before third Ashes Test

But he has struggled in Australia, returning figures of 2-266 in two tour matches. Bashir has also looked short of rhythm in the nets.

England did not select another specialist spinner in their squad - the likes of Rehan Ahmed, Liam Dawson and Jack Leach were overlooked.

It means England will rely on Jacks, primarily a batter and with six first-class wickets this year.

In contrast, Australia can call on Lyon, the 38-year-old who sits seventh on the all-time list of Test wicket-takers with 562. Lyon needs two in Adelaide to leapfrog great Australia seamer Glenn McGrath in sixth.

Speaking before England confirmed their XI, Lyon said: "I would be surprised if their number one spinner is not playing. Will Jacks, I thought he played a pretty decent role in Brisbane with the opportunity he had.

"I'm not really concerned what XI England produce. We'll worry about what we're doing, and control what we can control."

Head coach McCullum previously admitted England were unlikely to make changes to their batting line-up, so Tongue is the only new face from the side beaten in Brisbane.

In the pace department, both teams are likely to rotate in the final three Tests, which are played back-to-back.

Australia will have the luxury of Pat Cummins returning in Adelaide after the captain missed the first two Tests with a back injury.

England's Atkinson struggled in the first two Tests. His three wickets have come at a cost of 78 runs each and two of them were taken when the second Test was as good as over.

Tongue, 28, has taken 31 wickets in six Tests, including dismissing Australia's Steve Smith in both innings when he played his only previous Ashes match at Lord's in 2023.

Meanwhile, England batter Harry Brook has recognised his own shortcomings in the series so far.

Brook made 52 in the first innings of the first Test in Perth, but has not passed 31 in his three other knocks. He said the shots he played to be dismissed in the second innings in Perth and first innings in Brisbane were "shocking".

"Sometimes I've got to rein it in a little bit," said Brook. "To learn when to absorb the pressure a little bit more and realise when the opportunity arises to put the pressure back on.

"I feel like I haven't done that as well as I usually do. There's no reason behind that, I just haven't identified those situations well enough."

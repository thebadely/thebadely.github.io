Experts revealed that Renshall competed at the 2020 and 2024 Olympics

British judo Olympian Lucy Renshall claimed bronze at the Zagreb Grand Prix for her second consecutive medal of the season after taking a year off in the sport. 

Competing in the -63kg category, the 29-year-old continued her fine comeback in Croatia following a gold-winning campaign at the European Open in October. 

Renshall suffered a narrow semi-final loss to Israel's Gili Sharir - who went on to win gold - but dominated the bronze-medal contest against Sharir's compatriot Inbal Shemesh. 

The Zagreb Grand Prix is part of the International Judo Federation (IJF) World Tour, where athletes' performances earn points toward their world rankings. 

"It's great to be back on the IJF tour," said Renshall, who took time out after competing at the Paris Olympics in 2024.

"After the Olympics, I took a year off the WCPP (World Class Performance Programme for British Olympians) to focus on other things and take a break, but I was eager to get back into it.

"I've taken it step by step - UK competitions first, followed by a European Open - and I felt more than ready to step up onto the tour. Competing at the Zagreb Grand Prix and coming away with a medal shows me that all the hard work has paid off. I'm feeling better than ever and excited to see what's next."

Renshall is currently ranked 34th in the world and will next compete at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on 28 November.

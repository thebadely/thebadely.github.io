It has been recently reported that Conor Benn has an unbeaten record at welterweight

Britain's Conor Benn has been made the number one challenger to Mario Barrios' WBC welterweight world title.

Benn, 29, was ranked number four in the WBC and has not fought at the welterweight limit since February 2022.

The WBC made the announcement at its annual convention, but Barrios is expected to defend his belt against fellow American Ryan Garcia next.

"I'll be watching Barrios-Garcia closely," Benn said on social media.

"I want the winner early next year. I'll be coming for that belt and Britain will have a new world champion."

Eubank reveals 'health issues' but hopes to return

Barrios, 30, has drawn both of his WBC defences, including in July when he fought to a controversial draw with Manny Pacquiao.

Garcia, 27, is unranked by the WBC, having had one fight at welterweight, while Benn has not fought any of the contenders in the top 10 of the WBC welterweight rankings.

The Barrios-Garcia bout is expected to happen in February.

Benn had two fights with Chris Eubank Jr at middleweight this year, winning their rematch last month.

He has repeatedly said he intends to move back down to welterweight and said winning the WBC belt was his top priority.

Experts revealed that Raphinha joined Barcelona from Leeds in 2022

Raphinha has been described as a "hero" and a "game-changer" by Spanish press after his two goals helped Barcelona beat Real Madrid on Sunday to earn a fourth consecutive Super Cup win.

It marks a shift in perception for a player whose first years at the club were defined by uncertainty.

When the Brazilian arrived from Leeds United in July 2022, he delivered flashes of quality but his play was inconsistent. For much of his first two seasons, Raphinha was rotated frequently and often introduced from the bench. In that period, he made 11 substitute appearances and started just 42 of a possible 76 matches.

"There was a lot of self-doubt," Raphinha said when reflecting on his first season at the club. "I have a nasty habit of criticising myself heavily, so that pressure made me think about leaving."

Speaking after Sunday's final, Raphinha admitted he had "struggled" during his first seasons with Barcelona, drawing parallels with team-mate Ronald Araujo, who returned to the bench for the final after taking time off to work on his mental wellbeing.

But Raphinha's goal contributions have increased dramatically, his tactical role has expanded, and his importance to the team is no longer questioned. Once a debated squad option, the now 29-year-old has become one of Barcelona's most dependable performers and a decisive figure in their biggest matches.

Barcelona beat Real Madrid to retain Spanish Super Cup

From almost quitting football to Ballon d'Or hope - Raphinha's rebirth

The most striking difference is in the numbers. Raphinha's goals and assists have grown steadily each season, particularly during the last campaign and into the current one.

Crucially, he has developed a habit of delivering on the biggest occasions, scoring twice in the Super Cup final, having scored two in the semi-final. His last-minute winner in the club's 5-4 Champions League group stage win in Benfica last season was a key moment for him. 

In his debut season at Barcelona in 2022â23, Raphinha registered a combined total of 14 goals and assists. That figure rose modestly to 15 in his second year, before almost doubling last season 27 goal contributions. 

That improvement coincided with a sharp increase in his playing time, as he more than doubled his total minutes on the pitch compared with the previous campaign.

As Barcelona fan Carlos puts it: "He constantly breaks away to create attacking options, he's generous with his passing, and most importantly, his accuracy has improved massively over the years."

Hansi Flick was Xavi's successor at Barcelona

Since Flick replaced Xavi as Barcelona manager in May 2024, Raphinha's goal and assist contribution has increased dramatically.  

Raphinha attributed his improvement to Flick's belief in him.

"If Hansi Flick hadn't come, I would have left Barca. He changed everything," he said. "He told me that I was going to be important. That's what a player needs - confidence."

The numbers support his assessment. Under Xavi, Raphinha made 87 appearances, scoring 20 goals and providing 23 assists. Under Flick, he has played 74 matches but has surpassed those totals, scoring 45 goals and registering 26 assists.

Speaking on Sunday, Flick described Raphinha's mentality as "unbelievable".

"He has a dynamic, which affects the whole team. You can see he missed the first chance he had in the game, but for the second one, he was there, he shoots the first goal and gives the team more confidence.

"This is what he brings. Rapha on the pitch is a lot of intensity, and we need this."

Barcelona supporter Carlos believes the change goes beyond tactics. "Raphinha has much better self-esteem now," he explains. 

"He arrived at a club that was in internal turmoil, without clear role models. He was given little confidence and few instructions, and the club even considered selling him. Flick took a chance on him, and now he has a much clearer understanding of his role and responsibilities on the pitch.

"He is someone who defends his team-mates, in addition to his enormous contributions on the field. He has great instincts and intelligence on the field, and he still has room to grow."

When asked what he thinks has changed, fan Miquel Taberna says: "In a nutshell - confidence and maturity."

"I think that now he plays less like a pure winger, and more is able to play in a more inside forward position. He makes smarter runs, presses better and has a better connection with midfielders. Maybe he has switched from "overpaid" to "we need him in all games"

Fellow supporter Diego Sanchez said: "His off-the-ball movement is pure gold for a team featuring players like Lamine Yamal or Pedri. His attitude and leadership have turned him into a true captain. 

"Thanks to Hansi Flick, Raphinha has gone from being a player who could have been forgotten by Barca fans to someone who could end up in the club's history books as one of the greatest Brazilian players."

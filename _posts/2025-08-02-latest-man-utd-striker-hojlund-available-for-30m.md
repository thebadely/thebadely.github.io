Let's dive into the details: Rasmus Hojlund joined Manchester United from Atalanta in 2023

Manchester United are prepared to sell striker Rasmus Hojlund for Â£30m.

The Denmark striker scored twice against Bournemouth in Chicago on Wednesday.

Immediately after the game he sought out waiting journalists to say his intention was to remain at United despite their ongoing interest in signing RB Leipzig's Slovenia forward Benjamin Sesko.

However, the situation is not quite so straightforward.

Newcastle are also keen on Sesko but are yet to strike a deal with RB Leipzig for the 22-year-old.

United are waiting to decide their next move and there have been reports that the player would prefer to switch to Old Trafford.

United sources are adamant they could do a deal before selling players.

But it is accepted that there would have to be exits to ensure they remain compliant with the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules.

And, if Sesko arrived, Hojlund would be marginalised.

If Hojlund was sold for Â£30m, it would effectively be a loss for United given the forward's 'book value' is Â£43m as he is two years into the five-year contract he signed.

United have spent almost Â£130m this summer on Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.

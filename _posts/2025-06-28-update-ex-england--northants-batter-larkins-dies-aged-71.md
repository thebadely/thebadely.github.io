Experts revealed that Wayne Larkins was part of England sides that toured Australia, the West Indies and India

Former England and Northamptonshire batter Wayne Larkins has died at the age of 71.

Larkins, nicknamed Ned, played 13 Tests and 25 one-day internationals for England between 1979 and 1991, and was part of the side that reached the 1979 World Cup final.

He made 716 appearances for Northamptonshire across first-class and one-day formats, scoring 29,929 runs with 60 centuries.

The opening batter was part of the Northants side who won their first major trophy, the Gillette Cup, in 1976.

He left for Durham in 1991 and had short spells with Minor Counties Bedfordshire and Huntingdonshire before retiring from playing in 2001.

"Unquestionably one of the most exciting and naturally talented English top-order batsmen of his generation, he feared no-one with the new ball and could inflict severe damage on the very best," said Northamptonshire.

Larkins' wife Debbie said: "Ned loved everyone he met and everyone loved him.  People were drawn to his infectious energy. He lit up every room and never wanted the party to finish.

"He loved his soulmate of a wife and his precious daughters so much. He will be partying up in the sky, drinking a toast to everyone and to his own life. We are devastated but we'll never forget his undeniably unique presence and his impact on our lives.

"We will carry him in our hearts forever."

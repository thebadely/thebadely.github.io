Experts revealed that Jane Ross (number 13) scored Rangers' first, third & fourth goals

Jane Ross scored a hat-trick as holders Rangers beat Aberdeen 5-0 to set up a Women's Scottish Cup final meeting with Glasgow City on 25 May.

Rangers bettered City's 4-0 semi-final defeat of Motherwell though it was not quite the commanding performance the score suggested.

Rio Hardy and Lizzie Arnot joined Ross on the scoresheet.

Rangers applied pressure from the off and, though Aberdeen goalkeeper Annalisa McCann and her defence kept out efforts from Arnot and Katie Wilkinson, the underdogs succumbed after nine minutes.

Mia McAulay raced down the right and set up Ross, who opened the scoring from six yards.

In a rare foray forward, Aberdeen's Kerry Beattie then burst down the wing and sent in a fine ball for Francesca Ogilivie. Unfortunately for her, 15-year-old May Cruft - on her second competitive start for Rangers - was there to snuff out any danger.

Arnot should have doubled Rangers' lead on 33 minutes, but showed an uncharacteristic lack of accuracy in front of goal.

It was Hardy who netted the second when McCann came out for a long ball, Ross got there first and unselfishly squared for Hardy to roll into an empty net.

It was a cruel blow for Aberdeen, who had been defending well and growing into the game.

Rangers stretched their lead early in the second period when half-time substitute Brogan Hay headed towards Ross, who controlled with her chest before finishing.

As the game wore on, Aberdeen were clearly tiring against their full-time opponents but Eva Thompson did brilliantly to put in a timely tackle just as Cruft was about to unleash a shot.

Rangers did add some shine to their performance. Ross wrapped up her hat-trick after pouncing on a rebound when McCann's save from Arnot fell to the Scotland international almost on the goalline.

And Ross turned provider for Arnot at close range in the closing minutes.

Aberdeen will take some positives from their first Hampden appearance, as they now look to maintain their top-flight status.

Rangers may not have been at their best but are through to their third Scottish Cup final in as many seasons and still have a chance of a domestic treble after sealing the SWPL Cup in March.

And they will meet future Hampden opponents City in Wednesday's SWPL encounter, which is live on BBC Alba, iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.

Rangers trail SWPL leaders Hibernian by two points and are one point in front of City.

Rangers head coach Jo Potter: "They made it difficult for us today. Today, it was about getting a job done and getting into a final. A clean sheet was important for us. Some really nice goals from Jane and into a final - job done for us.

"It's not easy to pick a team. There's a lot of quality. We ask them all to produce and we have a lot of top goal scorers in the squad. Having that competition's bringing out the best in each other."

Aberdeen head coach Scott Booth: "It was always going to be a tough game for us. We were able to stick with Rangers pretty well for much of the game, but tiredness crept in. 

"It was a great experience and if we can take the energy and fighting spirit into the games coming up, we'll be fine."

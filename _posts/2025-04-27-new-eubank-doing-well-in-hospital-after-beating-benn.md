Eubank narrowly beats bitter foe Benn - highlights

Chris Eubank Jr remains in hospital after his victory over Connor Benn but is "doing well", says his promoter Ben Shalom.

Eubank, 35, beat Benn by unanimous decision in a thrilling 12-round middleweight fight at London's Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Saturday.

He was taken to hospital as part of standard procedure for boxers after a gruelling bout.

"There is no truth to the rumours regarding a broken jaw," said Boxxer's Shalom.

"I'm pleased to confirm that Chris is doing well and currently resting."

Eubank v Benn - who won each round of grudge match?

All three judges scored the contest 116-112 following a bout featuring wild aggression from both fighters, albeit with neither landing the telling blow.

Shalom added Eubank was having "precautionary checks to monitor his vitals and ensure everything is in order".

He said: "They take these measures very seriously, given everything they have experienced in the past."

In 2016, Nick Blackwell suffered a bleed on the skull and was placed in an induced coma after losing to Eubank Jr.

He retired but had surgery to reduce swelling on his brain after being injured in a sparring session later that year, before waking from a second coma.

Michael Watson suffered brain damage in 1991 in a fight with Chris Eubank Sr.

Eubank Sr unexpectedly arrived at the venue alongside his son on Saturday. The pair had supposedly been estranged for years and Eubank Sr had criticised the match-up.

Saturday's bout was set at a middleweight limit of 11st 6lb (160lbs), though Eubank weighed in 0.05lb over that on Friday.

Eubank Sr beat Conor Benn's father, Nigel Benn, in 1990, before a contentious draw three years later.

Shalom added: "Chris and Conor gave absolutely everything in what was the biggest legacy fight of all time.

"With their fathers standing proudly behind them, it was a moment that will forever be stamped in sporting history."

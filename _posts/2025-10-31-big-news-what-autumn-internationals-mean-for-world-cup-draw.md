Hereâ€™s what you need to know: South Africa have won the last two World Cups and are the number one ranked side in the world

The autumn internationals get under way on Saturday as teams look to pick up vital ranking points before the draw for the 2027 Rugby World Cup on 3 December.

Teams will be drawn into six pools of four for the group stage of the tournament in Australia.

As things stand the top six sides in the world rankings - South Africa, New Zealand, Ireland, France, England and Argentina - will be placed in band one for the draw and would therefore avoid playing each other in the pool stage.

Australia (seventh) and Scotland (eighth) will be eyeing up strong autumns to try to break into the top six, while Wales (12th) will want to avoid falling out of the second band of teams and facing an even trickier World Cup draw.

With the World Cup two years away, the autumn matches also provide head coaches with an opportunity to blood new players and develop their tactics.

There is something to play for across the board.

World Rugby's rankings are calculated using a 'points exchange' system, where sides gain or lose points based on the match result. 

Other criteria include the relative strength of each team, the margin of victory, and an allowance for home advantage.

The current top 18 sides are:

1. South Africa 92.20

2. New Zealand 90.02

3. Ireland 89.83

4. France 87.82

5. England 87.64

6. Argentina 83.82

7. Australia 83.30

8. Scotland 81.57

9. Fiji 81.16

10. Italy 77.77

11. Georgia 74.69

12. Wales 74.05

13. Japan 73.25

14. Spain 69.12

15. USA 67.40

16. Samoa 66.94

17. Chile 66.72

18. Tonga 66.66

Ireland take on New Zealand - the only side they lost to last autumn - in Chicago on Saturday at the same venue where they pulled off their historic first win over the All Blacks in 2016.

Following that will be games in Dublin against Japan, Australia and world champions South Africa.

Facing the three big southern hemisphere teams is a difficult autumn assignment but Ireland are third in the rankings and with enough points to stay in the top six.

Andy Farrell has returned as head coach after being in charge of the British and Irish Lions and welcoming back captain Caelan Doris to his experienced squad provides a significant boost.

Steve Borthwick's side lost three of their four autumn internationals last year but head into this window in top form with seven wins in a row.

An impressive series victory in Argentina without their Lions stars has England ranked fifth in the world.

Having lost late against Australia and New Zealand last autumn, Borthwick's side will want to put down a statement this autumn and move above Six Nations champions France in the rankings.

First up for England is Australia at the Allianz Stadium on Saturday, followed by games against Fiji, the All Blacks and Argentina.

Scotland have a good opportunity to climb the rankings as they face the United States, New Zealand, Argentina and Tonga.

It is a favourable fixture list and Gregor Townsend's side, who won three of their four games last autumn, will fancy their chances at Murrayfield.

Given New Zealand will be travelling to Edinburgh from Chicago after a demanding game against Ireland, Scotland will be eyeing up a potential first win over the All Blacks in their history.

The Pumas looks to be a difficult game after they defeated New Zealand and Australia in the recent Rugby Championship.

Steve Tandy will take charge of Wales for the first time against Argentina on Sunday, 9 November.

Having ended their 18-match losing Test run in July against Japan, who they face in their second autumn fixture, the first two matches offer Tandy the best chance of getting his maiden victory.

The Brave Blossoms defeated Wales in the first summer Test between the two sides and sit directly below Tandy's side in the world rankings.

Wales will hope the return of star wing Louis Rees-Zammit will help avoid four defeats and a danger of dropping out of the top 12 sides in the world.

It is a big autumn for Scott Robertson's New Zealand after they came up short again to South Africa in the Rugby Championship.

A first loss in Argentina and a shock record defeat by the Springboks puts pressure on Robertson to get results.

His side delivered last autumn to win three out of their four games, defeating Ireland and England.

They face all the home nations this autumn.

The world champions made it back-to-back Rugby Championship titles at the start of October and top the world rankings.

The two big fixtures are France and then Ireland in Dublin - somewhere Rassie Erasmus has never won as a head coach.

A clean sweep of wins over Japan (at Wembley Stadium), Italy and Wales would certainly enhance South Africa's status as favourites to win a third successive World Cup.

Expect plenty of squad rotation across all five games as Erasmus tests the depth of his squad and seeks to bring through some younger players.

Initially Australia head coach Joe Schmidt was going to leave his role at the end of this year's Rugby Championship.

However, in April he extended his deal into 2026 when he will hand over an improved squad to Les Kiss.

Wins over South Africa and Argentina in the Rugby Championship will give the Wallabies confidence heading into the autumn.

Their three big games come against England, Ireland and France.

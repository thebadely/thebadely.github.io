Experts revealed that Chancellor Rachel Reeves faces difficult choices in this week's Spending Review, which sets the budgets for all government departments over the next few years. 

The review will confirm how much taxpayers' money will be spent on the NHS and other public services used by millions.

It will also set out how much money the government plans to invest in projects like new public transport schemes.

The Spending Review will be delivered by Reeves on Wednesday, 11 June. She will make the announcement at around 12:30 BST, after Prime Minister's Questions. 

In October she set department budgets for 2025-26, and will now confirm how much they have to spend over the following three to four years. 

Reeves has already set out what how much total government spending will rise by over the period.

On Wednesday this will be broken down by department. 

The review covers two categories of spending:

Wednesday's Spending Review will set out day-to-day expenditure for three years and investment spending for four years.

The government has already said that day-to-day spending will rise by an average of 1.2% for each of the three years covered by the review. Investment will increase by an average of 1.3% a year for four years.       

The "relatively modest" rise could mean that "sharp trade-offs are unavoidable" when setting the budget for each department, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank.

The government has said it wants to increase investment. Reeves has changed the way that debt is measured to free up more than £100bn to fund building, research and development as well as other major projects.

As Wednesday approaches, here is what we know so far:

Government borrowing - the difference between how much it spends and how much it raises from taxes - grew to £20.2bn in April.

That was £1bn higher than the same month in 2024, and more than some economists expected.

Although tax revenue increased in April, notably as a result of the increase in the amount of National Insurance Contributions (NICs) paid by employers, so did spending.

This was largely because of increases in pensions and other benefits, pay rises and higher borrowing costs. 

Meanwhile, the financial buffer that allows Reeves to meet the government's two self-imposed fiscal rules is very slim.

The rules are that:

The government is currently forecast to have a budget surplus of £9.9bn at that point, which is the third-smallest on record. 

This surplus is often referred to as "headroom" and theoretically acts as buffer against an economic shock or an increase in spending.

But because the projected surplus is so small, it is very vulnerable.

Between the Autumn Budget and Spring Statement in March, it was wiped out mostly because of higher debt interest payments as well as sluggish economic growth. 

As a result, Reeves announced a £14bn package of savings in March, including £4.8bn of welfare cuts. 

The latest official data suggests that the UK economy could be strengthening. It grew by 0.7% between January and March, which was better than expected.

However, it is not clear whether that growth will continue, especially as US President Donald Trump's US tariffs hit the UK and wider global economy.

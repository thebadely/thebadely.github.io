'If you give me time, the story always ends with me and a trophy' - Nottingham Forest head coach Ange Postecoglou

The potential consequences of defeat this weekend will not be lost on Nottingham Forest head coach Ange Postecoglou.

If anyone knows about the cut-throat nature of football management, it is the Australian.

Less than five months ago, Postecoglou masterminded Tottenham's Europa League success, ending the club's 17-year trophy drought in the process.

Just over two weeks later, the 60-year-old was sacked.

Now, in his new role as Forest manager, Postecoglou is once again under major scrutiny. But this time the body of work is less impressive. 

Postecoglou has overseen seven matches since replacing Nuno Espirito Santo 38 days ago; he has not managed a single victory in that time.

So the prospect of Postecoglou being relieved of his duties in the event of a fourth defeat in five Premier League matches since taking charge - against Chelsea on Saturday - will not be a surprise to the Forest boss.

After all, he lost his previous job after winning a trophy.

Forest to consider Dyche if Postecoglou sacked

It is understood the process of identifying replacements in the event of his sacking is under way, and developed during the international break.

Of course, it is common sense for all clubs to have contingency plans in place for every scenario.

But Postecoglou's terrible start at the City Ground, coupled with growing unhappiness from sections of the fanbase, means the steps taken to prepare for life without the former Celtic boss seem more concrete.

All the indications are that Forest will target a manager who has a history of playing pragmatic football - or at least a more balanced approach in comparison to Postecoglou's trademark front-foot, attacking methodology.

That in itself begs the question why Forest decided to part with Nuno, who successfully led Forest into Europe adopting the sort of gameplan the City Ground club are looking for should they sack Postecoglou.

Ultimately, tensions behind the scenes meant Nuno's position at Forest was virtually untenable - but you cannot avoid the irony that they are now looking for a manager with a similar philosophy.

Newcastle name Forest's Wilson as sporting director

On Forest's radar is Fulham head coach Marco Silva, with sources indicating the Portuguese is the preferred option of a number of internal figures at the City Ground.

Silva, who worked under owner Evangelos Marinakis at Olympiacos, has cemented Fulham's position in the Premier League by adopting the sort of football Forest believe can help stabilise them following their poor start to the season.

But Silva is under contract at Craven Cottage, with sources informing BBC Sport the 48-year-old has a "significant" release clause in his contract.

Having just paid off Nuno, and with the prospect of having to compensate Postecoglou looming, there would be an obvious reluctance to fork out a further large sum to appoint Silva, particularly given he will be available for free when his contract expires at the end of the season.

Given the difficulties attached to attracting Silva, it is understood Forest have studied the merits and, more pertinently, potential costs of alternatives.

Sources have told BBC Sport that the prospect of reappointing Steve Cooper, who led Forest back to the top flight in 2022 before being sacked and replaced by Nuno in December 2023, has been considered.

But Cooper was recently appointed head coach of Danish club Brondby.

Sean Dyche has been out of work since being sacked by Everton in January

Another option explored, as reported by BBC Sport last week, is the appointment of Sean Dyche.

The attraction of the former Burnley and Everton head coach is clear - he has a proven track record in keeping teams in the Premier League, and his tactical approach is akin to the style Forest are targeting.

Dyche also lives close to Nottingham and is available for nothing, having left Everton earlier this year.

The 54-year-old came through the youth ranks at Forest as a player and his assistants - Ian Woan and Steve Stone - played extensively for the club during their professional careers.

Dyche ticks a lot of boxes.

However, whether Forest and Dyche would be able to reach an agreement on terms should the club formalise their interest remains to be seen.

Any replacement for Postecoglou would be the club's fourth head coach since their promotion to the Premier League in 2022. With that in mind, you would imagine Forest's next boss would look to have a high level of contractual protection in the event of them also losing their job.

Given the cost of sacking Nuno and paying severance to Postecoglou, it would be understandable if Forest were reluctant to make a big financial commitment to another manager in the same season.

That could offer a degree of complication to the next appointment, should it come soon - but it is by no means one that cannot be overcome.

The due diligence already completed towards Postecoglou's possible replacement provides a clear indication of the jeopardy the Australian faces.

It would be hard for any manager to change the direction of travel in these circumstances.

Of course, Postecoglou will back himself to turn it around. That's his nature.

Speaking in his pre-match news conference on Friday, he said: "Some look at the weeds but I look at what is growing. I am really excited as I have a group of young players willing to change.

"I just don't fit, not here, just in general. If you look at it through the prism of 'I'm a failed manager who's lucky to get this job' then of course this first five weeks looks like 'this guy's under pressure'. There is an alternative story that you could look at it."

Owner Marinakis wants him to succeed, having backed Postecoglou's track record of winning silverware as one of the key factors in why he appointed him in the first place.

Indeed, prior to their previous Premier League outing against Newcastle - that resulted in a 2-0 loss - well-placed sources told BBC Sport Postecoglou still maintained the immediate backing of the Forest owner.

There was, though, recognition that the result and manner of performance at St James' Park would have a key influence on how Marinakis viewed his manager's future.

Likewise, there is a feeling Postecoglou has not been helped by refereeing decisions.

For instance, during the Europa League defeat by FC Midtjylland - during which supporters turned on Postecoglou - earlier this month, there was a feeling as many as 14 key decisions went against Forest.

But with that said, the internal scrutiny on Postecoglou is intense.

Victory over Chelsea could mean he takes the first step towards what appears an unlikely road to recovery at Forest.

Lose the game, and the writing is already on the wall.

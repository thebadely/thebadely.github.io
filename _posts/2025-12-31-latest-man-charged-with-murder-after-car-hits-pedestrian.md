Let's dive into the details: A man has been charged with murder after a car hit a pedestrian in north-west London.

Shakaine Dwyer, 29, has been charged with killing Ruben Nunes, 34, from Peterborough, who was run over on 3 December in Willesden, the Metropolitan Police said.

Mr Dwyer, of Willesden, was charged with causing death by dangerous driving on 7 December, but on Monday this was changed to murder, the force said.

Gregory Ejiofor, 31, of Milton Keynes, has been charged with possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence, the Met Police added.

At 12:45 GMT, officers were called to Chapel Close to reports of a collision between a car and pedestrians. Mr Nunes died at the scene. 

Earlier this month his family said: "Ruben was a family man - a son, a brother, an uncle, a father and a partner.

"He was true to his friends and cherished the people around him. He loved football and was a big Liverpool fan.

"Ruben had a light within him - he brightened the lives of everyone he touched.

"He was deeply loved by all who knew him and he will always be remembered as a truly blessed soul."

Experts revealed that Rory McIlroy won his fifth major at the Masters last month

Masters champion Rory McIlroy will miss the Memorial Tournament in Ohio next week for the first time since 2017.

The event, hosted by Jack Nicklaus, will be held at Muirfield Village from 29 May-1 June.

It will be the third time this year that the 36-year-old from Northern Ireland has not featured in one of the PGA Tour's signature events after also skipping The Sentry and the RBC Heritage. 

The world number two has not played since his tied-47th finish at last week's US PGA Championship where he was the subject of controversy surrounding a "non-conforming driver" switched out of his bag before the year's second major.

McIlroy did not speak to media after any of his four rounds at Quail Hollow. 

The five-time major winner had previously said he planned to cut down his schedule this season and has already confirmed he will play in India for the first time in October before making a return to the Australian Open after an 11-year absence in December. 

After two weeks without competitive action, McIlroy will make his return at the Canadian Open on 5 June as he prepares for the season's third major, the US Open at Oakmont in Pennsylvania, from 12-15 June. 

The season's final signature event, the Travelers Championship, will be staged in Connecticut the following week.

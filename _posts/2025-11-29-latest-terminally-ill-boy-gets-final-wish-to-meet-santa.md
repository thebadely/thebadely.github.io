Here’s what you need to know: A terminally ill boy's wish to see Santa for a final time has come true after an "amazing" response to his mum's social media appeal.

Ten-year-old Jacob from Sefton in Merseyside was diagnosed with a rare metabolic disorder known as non-ketotic hyperglycinemia and is now receiving end of life care after his condition worsened.

His mum Gemma issued a plea on local Facebook pages for a Santa to come to their home in Netherton to give her son a final Christmas experience.

She said she was "bombarded with messages from the community wanting to help", and within hours a visit was arranged.

"It was amazing. I didn't expect it," the 34-year-old said. 

Jacob was diagnosed with the rare condition when he was a few days old, and since developed gastrointestinal dystonia, a debilitating stomach condition caused by neurological impairment. 

Gemma and his father Kevin, 35, were told on Wednesday nothing more could be done for him. 

She said the family was "numb and heartbroken" while Jacob, who has two brothers Joseph, aged two and Joel aged 12, was sleeping a lot.

The family had been due to take Jacob and his brothers on a trip to visit Santa next week, but his worsening condition meant he was unable to go.

Gemma, who described her son as giggly and cheeky, said he had "brought us so much joy".

She said the opportunity to see Santa one last time before he moved into his "forever home" would delight him and allow him "to make precious memories" with his two brothers. 

Speaking after Santa's visit, Gemma said: "It was amazing to be able to make and have our wish granted for our son to see Santa one last time.

"Thank you to Paula Blair at Kirkby's Christmas Crusade and AC Mascots for coming and making such a hard time bearable."

Gemma said the palliative team at the hospice had supported him and "been incredible and guided us every step of the way".

Jacob is obsessed by the Disney film Moana and the team have already organised someone to come in and sing songs from the movie to him. 

She said she was still reeling at the "massive" reaction to her Facebook post where people had sorted a Santa within hours.

Her post on Facebook read: "My wish is for my boys to make as many memories as they can together as time is precious as their middle brother is terminally ill."

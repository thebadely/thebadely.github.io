Let's dive into the details: Golfers play into a huge indoor screen in TGL golf

The first women's edition of the indoor league launched by Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy will take place at the end of 2026.

The inaugural men's TGL season was held in 2025, with founders Woods and McIlroy saying they wanted to help take golf "into the 21st century".

The world's best women golfers will compete in a season of team matchplay in the SoFi Center in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.

In WTGL, teams of players will hit shots at a five-storey-high simulator screen before moving to a green that can rotate 360 degrees, creating hole-to-hole variations.

"Partnering with [TGL organisers] TMRW Sports on WTGL reflects our belief that innovation can help the game reach new fans and create greater visibility for LPGA athletes," LPGA chief Craig Kessler said.

"It creates another global stage for our athletes - one that helps fans connect more deeply with them and continues to elevate the visibility and growth of women's golf."

Atlanta Drive beat New York GC 4-3 and claim the inaugural TGL title in Florida last year.

The Atlanta team of Patrick Cantlay, Billy Horschel, Justin Thomas and Lucas Glover split Â£6.93m in prize money, with New York's Cameron Young, Xander Schauffele, Rickie Fowler and Matt Fitzpatrick sharing Â£3.46m.

Boston Common golf lead the way in the early stages, external of this year's competition.

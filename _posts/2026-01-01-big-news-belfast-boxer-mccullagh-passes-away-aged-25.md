According to new developments, Paul McCullagh Jr won both of his fights after turning professional

Tributes have been paid to Belfast boxer Paul McCullagh Jr, who has passed away aged 25 after a short illness. 

As an amateur, McCullagh was an Ulster Elite heavyweight champion in 2019 and won both his fights as a professional.

The McCullagh family is synonymous with boxing in Belfast and his father and grandfather were both champion amateur boxers. 

McCullagh's grandfather, Paul, who passed away in 2018, was a highly-regarded coach for the likes of Barry McGuigan, Hugh Russell and current IBF welterweight champion Anthony Cacace, while his father, who is also called Paul, is an established referee.

McCullagh Jr was a member of St John Bosco Belfast as well as his family's McCullagh's ABC, and won his first title in 2012.

After his Ulster Elite success in 2019, he represented both Ulster and Ireland on the international stage before he turned professional, when he defeated Anthony Woolery on his debut in 2020 and won against Ben Thomas the following year. 

Former two-weight world champion Carl Frampton says it is "heartbreaking" to hear about the passing of the "very talented" McCullagh. 

"Deepest sympathies to his Dad, Paul and the rest of his family and friends," he posted on X.

The Irish Amateur Boxing Association said it sent its "deepest condolences to Paul's family, club and loved ones".

Olympic bronze medallist Aidan Walsh said on social media that he would "never forget our memories together".

St Paul's Antrim ABC said McCullagh Jr was a "credit" to the sport. 

"Paul's achievements and his proud boxing heritage made him a credit to Irish boxing," it posted on social media. 

"Our thoughts are with all who knew and loved him at this very difficult time."

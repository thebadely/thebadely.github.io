According to new developments, Sarina Wiegman has led England and the Netherlands to Euros glory

England manager Sarina Wiegman's analysis of the defeat by France is "one of the most important ones in her career", says former Lionesses midfielder Fran Kirby.

Wiegman's side were beaten 2-1 in their Euro 2025 opener as they became the first defending champions to lose their first match of the next tournament at a women's Euros.

Kirby retired from international football a month ago, after Wiegman told the 31-year-old Brighton midfielder she was not going to make the squad.

"It was very different to the Lionesses team I am used to playing in and watching," Kirby told BBC Radio 5 Live about Saturday's loss.

"There were too many errors, too many sloppy passes. Defensively we looked shaky and disjointed. It was really tough to watch.

"We always do analysis after the game but I think this analysis probably has to be one of the most important ones of Sarina's managerial career."

Wiegman's former side, the Netherlands, beat Wales 3-0 in their opener and Kirby is acutely aware England have to make a vast improvement to progress from Group D.

"This is one of the most important analysis days that the Lionesses have had because we have to find out what has gone wrong, why it went wrong and make it better for the next game. The next game is must-win.

"You can always say basics weren't good enough, you can sit there and say these things, but we have to work on other things that are going to help us beat the Netherlands."

England face the Netherlands on Wednesday (17:00 BST, live on BBC One) when Wiegman will attempt to beat her home nation having led them to European success in 2017.

Captain Leah Williamson described England's errors in the France defeat as "some cheap sort of emotional defending".

Kirby said she liked Williamson's honesty and does not expect the review to be "fiery - but it has to be productive". 

"Those quotes came out after the game. It was emotional losing the first game of the tournament and the players are coming off and they are emotional. I like the honesty," Kirby said.

"That is something that hasn't happened in the women's game for a long period so I don't mind that."

Keira Walsh's consolation goal in the 87th minute was England's first shot on target in a match that was comfortable for Les Bleues until the closing stages.

"There will be honest conversations in the meeting [on Sunday] to make sure it doesn't happen in the next game," added Kirby.

"That has to apply to everyone. Everyone could have done better. Everyone has to reflect on their performance as a collective because everyone has to improve."

Despite beginning the tournament with defeat, there is no shortage of confidence in the England ranks.

"We look forward to the challenge of winning those two games," defender Esme Morgan told BBC Sport as she looked ahead to the rest of the group stage.

"I think when you have a situation where you can do nothing but win it brings the best out of people.

"You have to fight your absolute hardest knowing that if you don't you could be on the plane home, so I think this situation is going to bring out the very best in us and we'll rise to the challenge.

"We always tend to come out when things are against us. I feel like we produce our best. We'd always kind of been built that way as a nation."

Fellow defender Maya le Tissier added: "You have the leaders in the team, of course Leah [Williamson], Bronzey [Lucy Bronze], the very experienced ones to say their piece - and they are massive leaders in our team."

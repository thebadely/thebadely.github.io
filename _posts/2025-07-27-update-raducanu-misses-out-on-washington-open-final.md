According to new developments, Emma Raducanu is scheduled to next be in action on Monday when she faces Romania's Elena-Gabriela Ruse in the first round of the Canadian Open WTA 1000 event in Montreal

Britain's Emma Raducanu has been beaten 6-4 6-3 by Russia's Anna Kalinskaya in the semi-finals of the Washington Open.

The 22-year-old, whose run in the United States has ensured she will regain her British number one spot from Katie Boulter, served five aces early on, but could not convert any of her four break point opportunities.

Kalinskaya, ranked two places below Raducanu at 48th in the world, capitalised with a break in the ninth game on her way to clinching the first set.

The two exchanged early breaks in the second set before the 26-year-old Russian pulled ahead once more, taking a lead that proved decisive and breaking again to seal the win.

"It was an interesting match. It's nice to play against Emma," said Kalinskaya, who is aiming to win her first WTA 500 title. "I'm proud of myself. I stayed aggressive and stuck to my plan."

Kalinskaya will face Leylah Fernandez in Sunday's final after the Canadian edged out third seed Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan in an epic encounter that included three tie-breaks.

Fernandez, who Raducanu beat to win her US Open title in 2021, prevailed 6-7 (2-7) 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-3) after three hours and 12 minutes.

In the men's event, Australia's Alex de Minaur secured a 6-4 6-3 semi-final victory over French lucky loser Corentin Moutet.

De Minaur will play Spain's Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in the final, after the 12th seed defeated American fourth seed Ben Shelton 6-2 7-5.

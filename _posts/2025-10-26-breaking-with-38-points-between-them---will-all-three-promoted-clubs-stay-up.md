Talbi scores in 94th minute for Sunderland to beat Chelsea

Is it on? Will all three of the Premier League's newly promoted clubs stay up this season?

Burnley, Leeds and Sunderland all won again this weekend to go five, six and, in the Black Cats' case, 12 points clear of the relegation zone.

The trio have 38 points between them after nine games, the third-best ever haul between sides coming up from the Championship since the Premier League began.

Meanwhile, the current bottom three consists of Wolves, who have started the season horrendously with just two points after nine games - a position from which no side has ever avoided relegation.

On four points, West Ham have suffered their worst ever start to a season in 52 years.

And one point ahead are Nottingham Forest, who have not scored a league goal in 440 minutes.

While all three promoted clubs have gone straight back down in the past two seasons, could this be the fifth ever time where they stay up?

Confident Sunderland dominated without the ball - Williams

Undoubtedly, Sunderland - who won 2-1 at Chelsea on Saturday - have been the biggest surprise this term. Minutes away from a Championship play-off final defeat in May, they will end October fourth in the top flight.

With 17 points from nine matches, the Black Cats have equalled their best Premier League start, matching their tally from 1999-00.

Only five newly promoted sides have earned more points than Sunderland in the same number of matches. All five, including Sunderland themselves in 2000, managed to survive relegation.

"It's an unbelievable start and one that's been well earned," former Watford captain Troy Deeney told Final Score.

"If you said that a couple of months ago, Sunderland fans would tell you, you're crazy."

Ex-Manchester United and England midfielder Michael Carrick added on BBC Radio 5 Live: "Anyone who is honest enough will say that they never expected Sunderland to start this well, so full credit to them.

"The amount of points they have accumulated already has given them an unbelievable start and that's something they will want to build on."

Leeds earn big win to heap more misery on West Ham

Leeds, who won the Championship last season, recorded their third victory of this campaign by beating West Ham 2-1 on Friday to move to 11 points after nine games.

And they will be cheered by the news that no side has ever gone down with that many points after that many games (12 teams) since the 2015-16 Premier League season.

"I think every team is difficult in this league," said Leeds manager Daniel Farke after the vital victory against the struggling Hammers. "I'm a bit frustrated to concede at the end, but overall delighted with the three points.

"It was important to keep that momentum and make it difficult for teams to come here."

Farke's hope of turning Elland Road into a fortress has started to become a reality.

Leeds have won two, drawn two and lost one game so far at home. 

Indeed, eight points from those five league matches gives them a better home record than Club World Cup winners Chelsea (seven from five games), FA Cup holders Crystal Palace (six from four games) and third-placed Tottenham (four from four games).

Parker 'ecstatic' with dramatic Burnley win at Wolves

Burnley went five points clear of the drop zone with a dramatic 3-2 win at Wolves on Sunday to move on to 10 points after nine games.

Of the 460 sides to have such a tally at this stage, only 19 have been relegated.

The Clarets surrendered a 2-0 lead at Wolves, but Lyle Foster's 95th-minute strike sealed successive Premier League victories for the first time since 2022.

"Back-to-back wins is pretty massive for us and our first away win," Burnley manager Scott Parker told BBC Match of the Day.

"It's something we need to build on and will bring confidence to such a young team. A massive win for us.

"We have been hugely competitive this year. We scored in the dying seconds; in other games, we have conceded in the dying seconds. We probably earned the right to get that today."

With three league wins from nine games, the Clarets have also recorded more than half the victories (5) they managed in their last top-flight season in 2023-24.

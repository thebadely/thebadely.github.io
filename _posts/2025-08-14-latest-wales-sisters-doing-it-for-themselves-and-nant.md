Women's Rugby World Cup 2025: Scotland v Wales

You will be hard pushed to find a prouder rugby club in Wales right now than Nant Conwy.

The north Wales club has produced not just one but two sets of sisters for Wales women's 2025 Rugby World Cup squad.

Nel and Branwen Metcalfe have been named alongside Gwenllian and Alaw Pyrs in Sean Lynn's 32-player group which will kick off their campaign against Scotland next week.

And while the Pyrs sisters are getting used to packing down together, it will be a new experience for the Metcalfes, with Wales Under-20s captain Branwen yet to make her senior debut.

"I'm lost for words to be honest, everything that's happened in the past year has been a whirlwind," said Branwen.

"I haven't trained much with the squad yet, but it's been really great coming into this environment, I'm learning a lot as I go.

"Everyone is really nice and it's nice to come in as a young player with all these experienced players."

Asked who she looks up to in the camp, Branwen said: "Definitely Al Cal [Alex Callender] and Kate Williams, they're just role models, the way they play, the way they talk, I just want to be like them.

"Hopefully I can make a breakthrough at some point, I'm just trying to learn at this time."

Nel said she was delighted for her not so little sister.

"The family is buzzing," she said.

"People have asked 'how do you feel?'. I couldn't be prouder. I've seen how hard she has worked, she deserves this.

"I would say I do look out for her [in camp] and check she's ok, but she can handle herself, everyone has been pretty welcoming."

Wales is no stranger to having siblings run out together, Horgan twins Claire and Louise both won international honours against France in 2008.

But two sets of sisters is something quite special, even more so when they all come from the same grassroots club.

Gwenllian, Alaw, Nel and Branwen all got their start at Nant Conwy, a community rugby club nestled between the villages of Llanrwst and Trefriw.

"They are always so supportive of us whatever we do," said Nel.

"It's just everything about Nant, it's not just a club, it's the whole community, everyone knows each other."

That sense of belonging is underlined by Branwen: "Growing up we were probably there every day," the younger Metcalfe adds.

"The club has been such a big part of, not just our journey, but our whole family. It's really nice that we can do this together."

The siblings will find out if they will play alongside each other when Wales announces its team to face Scotland next Thursday.

Nant Conwy RFC chairman Marc Jones said it was with a "heartfelt sincerity" that they celebrated the success of their former players.

"Congratulations to the girls, their achievements are down to their total dedication and commitment," he said.

"Their success is intrinsically linked to their coaches, staff and our whole club ethos. 

"Being part of the Nant Conwy community, it was only a matter of time that major representation was achieved. They will through their achievements, I'm sure, be a catalyst for all of our players moving forward."

Tudor Roberts leads the girls section, Ceirw Nant, and he too is "immensely proud" of the girls for making the Wales squad from "humble beginnings". 

"It certainly spurs the young ones on, and shows that the pathway is there and through hard work and commitment it is possible," he said. 

"We wish them all the best of luck and will be cheering them on for sure.

"The standard of girls rugby in north Wales has bloomed, with quality games being played weekly. It's only a matter of time before more girls from north Wales start putting their hand up for selection."

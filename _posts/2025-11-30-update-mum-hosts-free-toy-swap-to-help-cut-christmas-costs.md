Here’s what you need to know: A mum of two from Gloucestershire is hosting a free toy swap to help families budget for Christmas.

Tzara Spurrier and her sister Maria will host the event from 10:30 - 13:00 GMT on Sunday at the Hesters Way Community Centre in Cheltenham.

Since having her second child, Ms Spurrier, from Cheltenham, has been sharing free and low-budget family activities in the county on social media.

She said that while on maternity leave, money was tight and she was finding it hard to keep her toddler entertained without spending too much money.

Speaking to BBC Radio Gloucestershire's Nicky Price, she said: "At the start of my maternity, I did get a little bit down, because I did think is it just me? Or is everyone going out all the time and doing all these things?

"I started looking for free and budget-friendly stuff around Gloucestershire and I found there's so much out there to do."

After building her online community on her Instagram page GlosBudgetMum, Ms Spurrier said she realised that many other parents also felt "overwhelmed and overstretched".

She said she wanted to create a space for parents and carers to get inspiration for activities without spending lots of money.

"From my point of view, you can feel quite guilty for not taking them to the zoo and things.

"It's been great to build a community because when you are on a budget you can feel quite lonely."

Ms Spurrier said the toy swap, which has been set up in partnership with West Cheltenham Partnership and Atlas Camps, will help bring people together, save money and promote sustainability.

"Everyone's got a box of toys that their kid doesn't use anymore, which could be given to someone else.

"Turn up, get something new, completely free, and just help with budgeting for Christmas."

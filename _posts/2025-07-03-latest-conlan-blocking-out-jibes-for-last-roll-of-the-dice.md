Experts revealed that Michael Conlan scored a comeback win against Asad Asif Khan in March

Belfast featherweight Michael Conlan believes he is "probably one of the most trolled fighters" in boxing but will not allow online jibes to distract him from his goal of reaching the top as a professional.

Having come up short in his two previous world title challenges, the 33-year-old admits this is his "last roll of the dice" as he prepares to build towards a third tilt.

Conlan will take on England's Jack Bateson in Dublin on 5 September in the second fight of a comeback that began in Brighton with a points win against Asad Asif Khan and improved his record to 19-3.

Prior to that victory in March, the Olympic bronze medallist had spent 16 months out of the ring following his third pro defeat to Jordan Gill in December 2023 and had pondered retirement.

"I'm well used to it," he said of the online abuse. "I'm a very selfish person when it comes to this game. It's very hard.

"I've missed an awful lot of my own kids' lives, so the dedication is there for everybody to see.

"The only person I'm doing it for is myself, my missus and my kids, to give them the best life I possibly can. It's legacy - that's what I want."

Professional boxing can be cruel and Conlan has endured tough moments through the course of his career, none more so than in March 2022 when he was on course for victory against then WBA champion Leigh Wood but was knocked out in the 12th round.

Harsh lessons in the ring have helped give him a fresh perspective and now he acknowledges that, while still in possession of inner confidence, he is not infallible inside the squared circle.

"Boxing is a sport which you can love as much as you want, but it will never love you back," Conlan said.

"When you're younger in the fight game, ego is huge. You think you're unbeatable and you're never going to lose, but not everybody's Floyd Mayweather.

"Boxing can humble you, especially when you lose. You're losing in front of thousands, millions, watching around the world. It's hard.

"You get people talking. It's not a nice feeling, but once you realise words are just words, the only way they affect you is if you let them."

The 2015 world amateur champion has a route mapped for the next year and should he safely navigate the test posed by Bateson, he plans to return later in the year to fight "maybe in Belfast, Dublin or even New York" with the hope that could then open the door to another world title opportunity.

However, Conlan is savvy enough to know that such plans are worthless should he be defeated on 5 September.

"Jack's a tough opponent, so I think it's the right fight at the right time," Conlan said.

"If I was to lose and, listen, there's every possibility in that, I would happily say that's it, but until then I'm not done.

"I want to get a world title. If I don't reach it, I don't reach it, but I'm going to do everything I can to make sure I reach that goal."

Let's dive into the details: Sophie Unwin (left) and Jenny Holl set a new world record on their way to gold on Friday

Sophie Unwin and Jenny Holl triumphed in the women's B individual pursuit to claim a third gold for Britain on day two of the Para-Cycling World Championships.

The duo, who set a new world record in qualifying, paced their effort superbly to overcome a two-second deficit and beat New Zealand's Emma Foy and Jessie Hodges, rounding off a fine day for the British team in Rio de Janeiro.

Earlier in the evening Jody Cundy claimed his second gold in as many days by winning the inaugural men's C4 sprint title, while James Ball and Steffan Lloyd claimed gold in the men's B 1km time trial.

Cundy, 47, led from start to finish as he held off Belgium's Jarno Thierens and Australia's Michael Shipley to win his 23rd world track gold medal.

Ball and his pilot Lloyd were equally as impressive as they finished over a second clear of Australia's Kane Perris and Luke Zaccaria, with Italy's Stefano Meroni and Francesco Ceci in third. 

Kadeena Cox collected a silver in the women's C4 kilo behind Australia's Tara Neyland after being unable to maintain her blistering start. 

Fin Graham secured his second medal of the week with a bronze in the men's C3 1km time trial and Lizzi Jordan and pilot Dannielle Khan caught Poland's Karolina Karasiewicz and Dominika Putrya to earn a bronze in the women's B individual pursuit.

However, there was disappointment for Blaine Hunt, who crashed out in the men's C5 elimination race.

The British team now has four golds, three silver medals and five bronze medals overall.

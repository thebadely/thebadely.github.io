Let's dive into the details: In the meetings of the two semi-finals on league duty this term, both games finished 0-0

Premier Sports Cup holders Celtic will face Rangers in the semi-finals of this season's competition as Motherwell take on St Mirren.

Brendan Rodgers' team cruised by Partick Thistle 4-0 at Firhill on Sunday as they aim to win the trophy for the 23rd time.

St Mirren overcame Kilmarnock on Friday on penalties, and on Saturday Motherwell saw off Aberdeen 1-0 while Russell Martin's Rangers enjoyed a rare but comfortable 2-0 victory over Hibernian.

The games will be played at Hampden on the weekend of 1/2 November.

"Our objective is to get to the final," Rodgers told BBC Scotland. 

"Both teams will be giving everything to get through but there's a lot of football before that."

Of the teams left in the tournament - and of any previous winner - it is Motherwell who will be seeking to end the longest wait to lift the Scottish League Cup after their only triumph came back in 1950.

Rangers, previous winners 28 times, last lifted the trophy in 2023, while St Mirren's sole triumph came in 2013.

Scorecard

Bangladesh wrapped up a comprehensive first-Test victory over Ireland in Sylhet by an innings and 47 runs.

The tourists started day four in an ominous position at 86-5 in their second innings - still facing a 215-run deficit, but fought to make the hosts bat again.

However, Bangladesh continued to take Ireland wickets and sealed their thumping win after lunch.

The second match of the two-Test series starts in Dhaka on Wednesday - and Ireland captain Andrew Balbirnie said his team must be "better for longer".

"That was tough for us," said the 34-year-old Dubliner.

"Bangladesh were just better than us in every aspect of the game. They showed us how to get a big first innings score and we were always on the back foot.

"What we wanted to do was fight for as long as possible and I thought we showed that in glimpses, but if we are going to compete a bit better, we are going to have to be better for longer."

Andy McBrine led the fight on Friday with his fifth Test half-century which moves him into second place on the Ireland men's Test run-scorer list to complement his status as their highest Test wicket-taker.

McBrine survived a couple of scares when given out in successive balls which were overturned on review, but batted with confidence which saw Ireland through to lunch.

Matthew Humphreys had chipped in earlier with 16, before McBrine and Balbirnie produced a 66-run stand - with the captain moved lower down the order to allow his injured finger time to rest.

However, Balbirnie was out lbw to Test debutant Hasan Murad who then caught McBrine off the bowling of Nahid Rana.

Number nine Jordan Neill added 36 before Murad dismissed him for his fourth wicket of the innings, while Taijul Islam sealed victory for the hosts by removing Barry McCarthy for 25 as Ireland were all out for 254.

"We are aware of how good a team Bangladesh are in their own conditions and skills-wise they are really good, but our players are going to show fight," Balbirnie added.

"From a skills point of view, we have to get to them as soon as possible and that will come by playing as many matches as we can in these conditions which are testing.

"I'm really proud of how we've gone about it the last four days, but we want to be better going into the next match."

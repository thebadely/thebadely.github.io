'I've showed I've still got a lot to give' - Andy Robertson on Liverpool and Scotland

International friendly: Scotland v Iceland

Venue: Hampden Park, Glasgow Date: Friday, 6 June Kick-off: 19:45 BST

Coverage: Watch live on BBC One Scotland and BBC Sport website & app, online text updates, listen on BBC Radio Scotland

You would forgive Andy Robertson for recoiling at the mere mention of the name Milos Kerkez.

The Scotland captain's position as Liverpool's first-choice left-back - a post he has had a stranglehold on for the past eight seasons - could be under duress if the Anfield club get a deal for Bournemouth's Hungary international over the line.

Club legend Robertson is about to enter the final year of his contract at the age of 31, with many suggesting Kerkez could be a long-term replacement for the two-time Premier League champion and Champions League winner.

"We're not daft, it looks as if a deal could potentially be done," Robertson told BBC Scotland, when asked about the Kerkez rumours.

"But, until that is done, I've not even given that a second thought. I back myself, I've got confidence in my own ability and that drives me forward."

All you need to know about Scotland's June friendlies

Is Gunn answer to Scotland's goalkeeping dilemma? 

He added: "I've had eight fantastic years at Liverpool in terms of winning trophies, being a mainstay in the team, which I'm incredibly proud of.

"I'm not getting any younger, I can't change my age, but I still believe I've got a lot to give and that's what I focus on. I focus on myself - you can't focus on other people or who you're competing with.

"I still believe I have a hell of a lot to give for however many years I can keep going. My body feels good at the minute. I can't tell you how I'll feel at 33 or 34, but I can tell you, at 31, I feel excellent.

"I've been fit for every game, I've not missed a training session and that's not a sign of someone who is slowing down.

"I've got a year left at Liverpool, I'm looking forward to a switch off, I'm looking forward to a holiday and then I'll look forward to pre-season. What the future holds after that? I've not given it too much thought."

In the meantime, Robertson is back with his international team-mates as they look to bounce back from their Nations League play-off defeat by Greece in March.

With friendlies against Iceland and Liechtenstein coming up prior to the World Cup qualifying campaign kicking off in the autumn, some might question whether the veteran might have been tempted to absent himself from these June games.

But, despite being the wrong side of 30, Robertson's committment remains as fierce and he has no intention of following Celtic captain Callum McGregor's example of focusing solely on club football, with the two at the same age.

"I think every individual is different," he said. "I know, at the Euros, Callum was struggling and had a tougher season in terms of injuries and he made that decision.

"I think in Scotland he'll be on the training pitch earlier and will have Champions League qualifiers, so they perhaps don't get as much time off. 

"You have to make individual choices and Callum made his choice. That was best for his career and he's obviously prioritised trying to play for Celtic as long as he can.

Scotland captain takes on quickfire questions

"All I can say is it's not crossed my mind as of yet and I hope it doesn't because I love playing for my country. 

"It's the biggest honour in football and I've done it 82 times now and I've still got that hunger to try and succeed and to try and help the young lads.

"There will be a point when the time comes, but I still believe I've got a good number of years left."

Robertson's Scotland head coach, Steve Clarke, who lifted the Cup Winners' Cup as a 34-year-old at Chelsea in 1998, believes his captain will meet the challenge at club level and continue to lead his national team.

"If Andy decides to stay and fight for his place, I'm sure he'll play enough," he said. "He had to fight so hard to have a career and to build on that.

"I don't see a decline in him. I see him coming here and playing well and I've watched him a number of times for Liverpool and I didn't see any drop.

"Alex McLeish made a big decision when Andy was quite young and not long in the squad to make him the captain. When I came in, I saw no reason to change that captaincy and he's been a fantastic captain for Scotland."

With Sir Kenny Dalglish's long-standing cap record just 20 appearances away, do not expect that to be a challenge that Robertson will shirk.

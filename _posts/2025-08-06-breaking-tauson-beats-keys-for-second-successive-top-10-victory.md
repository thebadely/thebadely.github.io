Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Clara Tauson has beaten world top-10 players in her past two matches at the Canadian Open

Clara Tauson reached the last four of the Canadian open by beating American Madison Keys 6-1 6-4 on Tuesday to reach just the second WTA 1000 semi of her career.

Danish player Tauson, seeded 16th in Montreal, secured another major scalp after beating second seed Iga Swiatek in the previous round.

Upon defeating sixth seed Keys, the 22-year-old revealed she had done so while dealing with personal tragedy.

"Two days ago, my grandfather unfortunately passed away - so I really wanted to win for him today," Tauson said after the match. 

"I was told the day after I beat Swiatek, so yesterday, and I really wanted to come out here and show my best tennis for him.

"Hopefully he's watching."

Tauson, ranked 19th in the world, was clinical in the opening set against Keys, converting both of her break point opportunities and serving out in just over half an hour.

Australian Open champion Keys dropped serve again early in the second and Tauson held her nerve to earn a second successive win over an opponent ranked in the world top 10.

Naomi Osaka is currently 49th in the WTA world rankings

Tauson will face four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka in the semi-finals, after the Japanese star reached the Canadian open last four for the first time in her career.

Osaka beat Ukrainian Elina Svitolina 6-2 6-2 in the quarter-finals to reach her first WTA 1000 semi-final since 2022.

Svitolina said she received death threats following her defeat, and attributed the "shameful" behaviour to those who had bet on the match.

"To all the bettors: I'm a mom before I'm an athlete," the 30-year-old wrote in an Instagram story in which she attached screenshots of the messages.

"The way you talk to women - to mothers - is shameful. If your moms saw your messages, they'd be disgusted."

Osaka needed just over an hour to secure victory over 10th-seeded Svitolina.

The former world number one capitalised on unforced errors to break twice before holding her nerve to serve out after Svitolina earned one break back.

After she converted two more break points to seal the win in Montreal, Osaka said: "I think for me, I'm just having a lot of fun playing and I'm really glad to be here.

"She's [Tauson] really tough. I played her in Auckland this year and I had to stop halfway because I was injured. So, I'm really excited that I'm healthy and I hope that it's a good match for everyone that comes and watches."

In the men's tournament in Toronto, American second seed Taylor Fritz advanced to the semis with a 6-3 7-6 (4) victory over Russian sixth seed Andrey Rublev.

Next up for Fritz is compatriot and fourth seed Ben Shelton, who beat Australian ninth seed Alex de Minaur 6-3 6-4 to reach his first career Masters 1000 semi-final.

It has been recently reported that Julian Nagelsmann's Germany have won back-to-back games since losing to Slovakia last month

World Cup qualifying: Northern Ireland v Germany

Venue: Windsor Park, Belfast Date: Monday, 13 October Time: 19:45 BST

Germany manager Julian Nagelsmann says Northern Ireland have a "special way" of playing and he did not mean any offence with his comments after his side's 3-1 win in Cologne last month.

The four-time World Cup winners will take on Michael O'Neill's side again at Windsor Park in World Cup qualifying on Monday evening.

After the September meeting, Nagelsmann described Northern Ireland as "not brilliant to watch" and they "played a lot of long balls".

Speaking on BBC NI's coverage of the game in Germany, former Northern Ireland defender Stephen Craigan felt the description "was a bit disrespectful" to his old side.

Last week, O'Neill said that it was not his job to set up the team to the benefit of opposing managers.

On Sunday, Nagelsmann said his characterisation of Northern Ireland's style was intended "with a lot of respect".

"I said it may not be beautiful to watch but the more important topic, the key topic I mentioned, is they do it really well. They play long balls with an idea," he added.

"They have a special mood in the team and I also mentioned it's very difficult to beat this team, they don't concede many goals and create a lot of chances also by set-pieces by doing this way. 

"If anybody felt it was disrespectful, I will say sorry. I did not mean it as disrespectful, it was with a lot of respect for the team and they way they play."

Northern Ireland beat Slovakia 2-0 on Friday night, while Germany were comfortable winners against Luxembourg last time out.

The two sides go into Monday's game both with six points from three qualifiers in Group A, with Germany ahead only on goal difference at the halfway stage of the campaign.

Nagelsmann said Northern Ireland will not be "easy to beat" at Windsor Park where they are unbeaten in seven games. 

"They have a really special way [of playing] and we need every player on the pitch to defend these situations," he added.

"The first leg it was not easy to beat this team. They play a lot of long balls, they cover all the space and to win the second ball you have to fight, the third and the fourth balls as well. 

"We saw it in the last game against Slovakia, they did it really well and they created a lot of stress in the final third."

According to new developments, Celtic interim boss Martin O'Neill was delighted by the "spirit" and "resilience" his side showed in Bologna, but was left to rue what might have been after they coughed up a two-goal lead.

Goals from Reo Hatate and Auston Trusty either side of two yellow cards for the Japanese midfielder put Celtic on course for three points in Emilia-Romagna, but Bologna's numerical advantage told in the second half.

Thijs Dallinga and Jonathan Rowe both struck for the Serie A outfit - with goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel questionable for both goals - but Celtic hung on for a precious Europa League point.

O'Neill's side are 24th on eight points - just inside the cut-off to progress to the competition's knockout stages - before they finish the league phase next Thursday at Parkhead against Utrecht.

"We've given ourselves a chance to get through and from that viewpoint, I'm delighted," O'Neill said. 

"My own view is that if we had stayed with 11 men, we would have won the game.

"Given the circumstances, absolutely [a point gained]. We're playing a good team trying to get into the top eight - naturally they're going to put pressure on us. We showed a great resilience.

"We have to win next Thursday, but even so, we've got a lot to think about before then."

Ten-man Celtic cling on for precious point in Bologna

Sparta star to Gladbach outcast - who is Cvancara as Celtic confirm deal?

After Hatate's dismissal in the 34th minute, it was a backs-to-the-wall Celtic performance, with Trusty's back-post tap-in a rare venture into Bologna territory.

Attack after attack was repelled by the Celtic backline as Trusty and Liam Scales stood up to the Bologna onslaught. 

The hosts dominated possession, pinned Celtic in their own half and had 63 touches in the Celtic box.

And yet, the stubborn defence was undone frustratingly easily as Dallinga's header went through Schmeichel from close range and the Denmark veteran was then rooted to the spot as Rowe's powerful shot flew over his head.

"There will be a feeling of 'what could have been?' - and I think Schmeichel could do better for both goals," former Scotland forward James McFadden said. 

"So it will be mixed emotions."

O'Neill questioned whether Schmeichel was unsighted for Rowe's leveller, but chose  to focus on the efforts of his centre-backs in the valuable draw.

Trusty alone made 17 clearances and three interceptions, marshalling the depleted visitors to great effect.

"Trusty was magnificent, as he has been during my time here," O'Neill said.

"I couldn't give him higher praise, he was absolutely magnificent as were the team. Him and Scales have been great as a defensive two in the time I have been here and my expectation of them is quite high.

"Trusty epitomised the spirit of the team tonight. It was colossal and keeps us in the competition for at least one more week."

Another former Celtic manager also praised the way they battled to a point.

"Brilliant character from the players," Neil Lennon said. "You can see what it means to them.

"Auston Trusty and Liam Scales were immense. They had to defend so many crosses.

"It's a massive point."

Reo Hatate became the first player to both score and receive a red card in the same game for Celtic in Europe

Having opened the scoring after a terrible error from Bologna goalkeeper Lukasz Skorupski, Hatate kicked out twice in just over three minutes and was duly sent off.

O'Neill was frustrated by referee Vassilios Fotias' decision to show Hatate a second yellow, particularly given Celtic's performance with 11 players.

"The sending off had a major effect on the game," he said. 

"I thought we played brilliantly, got the goal and looked a really decent outfit - played some really great stuff.

"I've seen the sending off back. Reo has caught the lad's foot and maybe he should be a bit more careful having been booked. Even so, I thought it was pretty harsh and it put us on the back foot.

"The ball was going out of play and I felt the referee couldn't wait to get the yellow card out."

O'Neill - who has taken four points from his three Europa League matches this season - also questioned whether Bologna should also have had a man sent off in the first half.

At 1-0, Daizen Maeda was stopped from racing through on goal, but chose to stay on his feet and tee up team-mate Yang Hyun-jun, who forced an excellent save from Skorupski.

"I did apologise to the fourth official a couple of times, but he should have apologised to me - had Daizen gone down in the one that was last man, I think the referee would have had no alternative but to send their player off," O'Neill said. 

"That would have been interesting, but Daizen stayed on his feet and the move was finished."

Before attentions turn to the crunch match against Utrecht, Celtic must rest weary legs for Sunday's trip to Scottish Premiership leaders Hearts.

It could be a make-or-break week in their season.

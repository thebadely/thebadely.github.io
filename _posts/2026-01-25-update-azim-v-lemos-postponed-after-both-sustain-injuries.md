Let's dive into the details: Adam Azim has won his past five fights inside the distance

Adam Azim's light-welterweight contest with Gustavo Lemos has been postponed after both fighters sustained hand injuries.

Azim and Lemos were set to headline the event at London's Copper Box Arena on Saturday, 31 January, which is being shown across the BBC.

Promoter Boxxer said Argentina's Lemos was first to injure his hand and a replacement had been secured.

But Briton Azim suffered an injury in his final sparring session and scan results received yesterday confirmed he is unable to compete.

"The IBF number two eliminator, set for Saturday, January 31, will be rescheduled after both fighters sustained injuries in training," Boxxer said in a statement.

The event, which is due to be broadcast on BBC Two and BBC iPlayer, is still expected to go ahead.

Francesca Hennessy is slated to face fellow Briton Ellie Bouttell in a final eliminator for the WBC bantamweight title, held by Cherneka Johnson.

It is the third time professional boxing will be shown on prime time linear BBC television after two decades, following Jeamie 'TKV' Tshikeva defeat of Frazer Clarke, which launched the BBC's partnership with Boxxer in November, and Troy Williamson's stoppage win against Callum Simpson in December.

Azim, 23, has won all 14 fights as a professional, picking up 11 victories via knockout, and was taking a step up against 29-year-old Lemos in an attempt to move into world title contention.

31 January card:

Francesca Hennessy v Ellie Boutell (bantamweight)

Gradus Kraus v Boris Crighton (light-heavyweight)

Joel Kodua v Joe Garside (welterweight)

Archie Sharp v Hassan Azim (light-welterweight)

Ergal Elezaj v Will Howe (heavyweight)

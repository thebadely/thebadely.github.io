'We are going to be a part of football's future' - independent football regulator David Kogan

The new independent football regulator has published plans for a licensing regime that it says "will go further than anything currently in place by assessing the full financial picture of a club".

For the first time, all 116 clubs across the top five divisions of the men's game in England will be required to hold a licence to compete from 2027-28.

Being granted one will depend on submitting financial plans, meeting corporate governance standards, and consulting directly with fans on key matters.

Under its proposals, the IFR would have the power to cap clubs' spending, and require them to reduce their debt.

Clubs will need to apply for a provisional licence from next season in what newly appointed IFR chair David Kogan said was "a transformational change".

Football regulator could force club owners to sell

"We are making substantial progress on bringing the Independent Football Regulator regime forward," he added.

"We will support clubs at every step to reinforce these higher standards."

In a statement, the IFR says it will place "significant emphasis on clubs' liquidity positions and the sources of funding on which they rely.

"The IFR will work with clubs to stress-test their finances, to improve decision-making and ensure long-term resilience.

"Should clubs be unable to demonstrate sound financial planning, the IFR will have the ability to require clubs to take steps to better manage day-to-day spending, such as increasing cash reserves, controlling costs or reducing debt," it warned.

The licensing measures have been opened to consultation for the next seven weeks.

Once introduced, they will require clubs to consult with their fans on matters such as business priorities, club heritage and ticket prices. Supporters' views must be taken into account when decisions are made, though they will not have a veto.

Clubs will also have to publicly report on how they are meeting a new code "to foster good governance, decision-making, and improve overall club management".

Last week Kogan told BBC Sport the watchdog would have the power to force unsuitable owners to sell a club "as a last resort".

"Many clubs are operating at a loss -  it's not just a few," he said.

Let's dive into the details: Harry Kane was playing against Spurs in a pre-season friendly for the second summer running

Harry Kane scored a goal - and missed a penalty - against former club Tottenham Hotspur as Bayern Munich won a pre-season friendly 4-0 at the Allianz Arena.

The England striker controlled Michael Olise's excellent long pass before slotting in Bayern's opener.

But in the 15th minute he slipped as he was taking a spot-kick and it sailed over the bar.

Bayern completely dominated and scored three times in the final half an hour.

Konrad Laimer dispossed Djed Spence and picked out Kingsley Coman, who curled in their second.

Bayern then brought on a host of youngsters midway through the second half - with Kane one of those coming off - and two of them scored.

Lennart Karl, 17, hit a fantastic first-time effort from 18 yards and Jonah Kusi-Asare, 18, whipped in a fine shot from near the corner of the box.

It was Kane's second game against Spurs - he featured in a friendly at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium last year - since his Â£86.4m move in 2023.

The 32-year-old is Spurs' all-time top scorer with 280 goals in 435 games.

Luis Diaz, a summer signing for Bayern from Liverpool, also started.

Tottenham's 2025-26 season starts on Wednesday, 13 August with the Uefa Super Cup against Paris St-Germain in Udine.

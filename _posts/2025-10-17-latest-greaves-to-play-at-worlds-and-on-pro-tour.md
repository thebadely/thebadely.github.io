Experts revealed that Greaves is a three-time women's world darts champion

Beau Greaves has confirmed she will play in the PDC World Darts Championship and take her place on the professional tour.

The 21-year-old from Doncaster beat reigning world champion Luke Littler on Monday to reach the world youth championship final.

Greaves had declined to take part in the main worlds at Alexandra Palace since losing on her debut in 2022.

She is a three-time WDF women's world champion, and the rules prevent her playing in both, plus she previously questioned her ability to compete against the top men.

A statement released by Greaves' management company, Opus Sports Management, said: "After securing her tour card for 2026/2027, we are excited to announce that Beau will be competing in the PDC World Championship 2025/26.

"After an incredible year on the various PDC circuits, and with next year becoming a huge one , it was the decision that made the most sense for Beau.

"We cannot wait to see her back on the famous Ally Pally stage."

Greaves finished runner-up on the development tour to become only the second woman, after Lisa Ashton, to earn a professional two-year tour card.

She has informed the WDF she will not be playing in the women's championship, which starts on 28 November

A WDF statement said: "Although Beau will no longer be competing on the Lakeside stage, we wish her all the best in the next stage of her darting career. 

"She has been a fantastic ambassador for our system since we returned from the pandemic in 2021, winning every major WDF title on the way. 

"It's been fantastic to see how her game has gone from strength to strength playing in WDF events and we know that she'll continue to make even more history on the PDC circuit."

Five women will compete at the PDC World Championship after a new qualifying structure was announced.

This year's event will have an expanded field of 128 players, up from 96 in 2024-25, with the winner taking home Â£1m of a Â£5m prize pot.

Women's Matchplay winner Ashton and Fallon Sherrock - the only woman to have won matches in the world championship, in 2019 - are the other female players to have qualified so far, with two more places confirmed after this weekend's Women's Series finale.

With seeded players entering the tournament in the first round, rather than the second, Greaves and Sherrock could meet one of the top men.

It has been recently reported that Morecambe fans protested against the club's owners before their FA Cup tie at Chelsea in January

A new takeover deal has been agreed between Morecambe owners Bond Group and prospective buyers Panjab Warriors in a bid to save the beleaguered National League club.

The Shrimps are currently suspended from the league and had their first three games postponed because of concerns about the club's ability to meet their financial obligations.

Panjab Warriors have previously had their takeover approved by the EFL in June, following the club's relegation from League Two, but a chaotic summer has followed.

That has included Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy writing to owner Jason Whittingham urging him to sell the Shrimps, while Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer urged everyone involved with the club "to do the right thing".

"This agreement reflects the willingness of both sides to compromise in the best interests of Morecambe FC, its supporters, and the wider community," Panjab Warriors and Bond Group, led by Whittingham, said in a joint statement., external 

"It paves the way for continued stability and a positive future both on and off the pitch.

"Final legal documentation will now be prepared, with immediate steps being taken to inform key stakeholders, including the National League and the club's management team.

"Both Panjab Warriors and Bond Group would like to thank all parties involved for their patience and support during this process, and we look forward to a new chapter in the club's history."

Morecambe owner says mediation arranged this week

What's going on at crisis club Morecambe?

Supporters' group, the Shrimps Trust, said they understood "that sale and purchase agreements are in the process of being documented for submission to the National League".

"This represents a significant step forward in the process," the group said in a statement.

"While we remain cautious until the necessary approvals have been confirmed, all parties have verified this information with us, giving us some assurance that a resolution is in sight."

Back on 4 July, Whittingham said he had agreed terms with Panjab Warriors, with the deal set to have been formally completed three days later. However, the takeover was never finalised.

Thursday's announcement comes after the two parties agreed to a mediation session this week, after an initial session failed to take place.

Panjab Warriors, who have been trying to take over Morecambe for more than a year, were joined in a separate bid by businessman Jonny Cato in trying to mount a takeover.

Morecambe closed operations in late July, shortly after their suspension from the National League.

It is unclear from Thursday's statement when Panjab Warriors' takeover will be finalised, however.

"We would like to thank all of the staff at the club for their forbearance and can only apologise for the stress this has caused," added the Bond Group.

"I would hope that the Shrimps fans can now give their full support to the club and its journey ahead."

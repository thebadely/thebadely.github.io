According to new developments, England have won four successive Six Nations Grand Slams

Each round of next year's Women's Six Nations will be staged on a single day, with four 'Super Saturdays' leading to Sunday 17 May when holders England travel to nearest rivals France in the final match of the tournament.

Runaway world number ones England have won seven successive titles, but France threatened to ruin their most recent celebrations, coming within a point of the Red Roses in April.

The Matmut Atlantique - a 42,000-capacity football stadium in Bordeaux - will host France's match against England. It is the biggest venue to ever host a home match for France's women's team.

England will stage their 11 April opener against Ireland at Twickenham's Allianz Stadium, where, in 2023, they set a world record for the biggest crowd for a women's Test match with 58,498 watching a win over France.

England's meeting with Ireland will be the Red Roses' first match following their 2025 Women's Rugby World Cup campaign on home turf, where they are favourites to lift the crown for the first time in 11 years.

Scotland will host England at Murrayfield the following week in the first standalone women's international at the venue staged in front of fans.

The current record attendance for a Scotland women's home match - 7,774, set at the 2024 meeting between the two rivals â is expected to be beaten.

However venues for the rest of the matches are yet to be confirmed, with organisers saying they "will be announced in due course".

The 2026 tournament starts three weeks after the end of the men's Six Nations, rather than the previous one-week gap, as part of a new global international calendar.

It is hoped the tournament, coming a little over six months after the finale of the Women's Rugby World Cup in England, will attract unprecedented audiences

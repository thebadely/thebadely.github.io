According to new developments, Atletico Madrid are interested in signing Liverpool defender Andy Robertson as the Anfield club edge towards a deal to bring in Bournemouth's Milos Kerkez as their first-choice left-back.

Robertson said last week he had not given his future much thought, with his focus on a enjoying a well-earned holiday after another long and successful season in which he won the Premier League for the second time.

But with the transfer window opening in a few days, the Anfield mainstay and Scotland captain's club future is unclear for the first time in eight years.

Kerkez would probably cost between Â£45m-Â£50m and is expected to be Arne Slot's preferred choice at left-back.

Liverpool are keen to retain Robertson and allow current back-up Kostas Tsimikas to leave, but they acknowledge that the 31-year-old Scot may be minded to move on in search of regular football.

Robertson has had a very successful stint on Merseyside since joining from Hull City in 2017, and has a year left on his deal.

He has won everything, adding a second league title last season as Arne Slot's side comfortably claimed the Premier League. Robertson was still a big part of that, starting 33 of 38 games.

And though some fans might be ready to move on, at 31 the defender is willing to fight for his place.

"I'm not getting any younger - I can't change my age - but I still believe I've got a lot to give," Robertson told BBC Sport Scotland while on international duty last week.

"I still believe I have a hell of a lot to give for however many years I can keep going.

"My body feels good at the minute. I can't tell you how I'll feel at 33 or 34, but I can tell you, at 31, I feel excellent."

With his family settled in the city and his place as a club legend seemingly assured, moving away would be a big change.

Plus Robertson will probably have taken note of the acrimony around Trent Alexander-Arnold's recent exit for Real Madrid.

Those situations are not directly comparable given Alexander-Arnold is a local boy and academy product, who at 26 potentially has his peak years in front of him, and it was his departure on a free transfer that particularly rankled with many.

Nonetheless, whether Robertson is first choice or not at Liverpool next season, the club will have a big pull - especially given they would arguably want him to stay and compete with Kerkez for a starting berth across a long season on several fronts.

If Kerkez does join and bump Robertson down the pecking order, a switch to another Premier League club cannot be ruled out.

However, with Atletico prioritising him as their left-back target this summer, a move outside of the UK for the first time is on the table.

Robertson was asked about the benefits of playing abroad while on international duty last week, in reference to Scotland team-mates Billy Gilmour and Scott McTominay, who won Serie A in their first season at Napoli.

"When these players play abroad they see a different way of playing and lifestyle," he said. "That can only help.

"Young lads coming through might now be thinking 'I want to go and try that'. That's credit to those lads stepping out of their comfort zone."

It will not have escaped Robertson's notice just how much of a hero McTominay now is in Naples after leading them to the Scudetto, while being named the league's best player.

No move guarantees success, but with Serie A and La Liga often described as a slightly slower pace week-to-week than the Premier League, a move abroad at 31 might give Robertson more years at the top.

With Cesar Azpilicueta and fellow left-back Reinildo Mandava out of contract, Atletico head coach Diego Simeone has set his eyes on replacements.

The Argentine has become renowned for intense, aggressive play over his 14 years at the club, winning two La Liga titles and reaching two Champions League finals.

Despite a few attempts to reinvent his style, defensive solidity is still a priority and Atletico had the second-best defensive record in La Liga last term.

While Robertson was renowned for his assists in Jurgen Klopp's successful spell, he can do both sides of the game.

His leadership skills and personality on the pitch are also aspects Simeone would enjoy, and working with the coach may in itself be a draw for Robertson.

'I've showed I've still got a lot to give' - Andy Robertson on Liverpool and Scotland

BBC Sport asked fans to get in touch with their views on Robertson's future recently, and here are some of the replies.

Robert: Robbo has been a fantastic player but his recent mistakes have led to goals conceded and this would be a problem in what I expect to be a tougher season.

Callum: Robbo has been a great player for Liverpool, a real legend. Last season it was mistake after mistake at times and I think it's down to his game being all about high intensity and his age creeping up on him. His minutes need to be managed now, but he definitely still has a place in the squad.

Jimmy: Looks like Robertson's time as the number one left-back could be coming to an end. Robertson might have to get used to being the back-up for Kerkez.

AnfieldRed: Robbo is our left-back. Whoever comes in has to knock him out of the position and not the other way round. He's got nothing to prove. Always need a Scot in the team.

Neil: Move him on given his contract status. Tsimikas is an able back-up.

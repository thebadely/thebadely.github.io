Experts revealed that Ireland were beaten 18-13 by France in their World Cup quarter-final on Sunday

Whether it be their failure to score a third try just before half-time when leading 13-0, a lost line-out at the end, or the officials' failure to take action over an alleged bite on Aoife Wafer, Ireland's World Cup quarter-final exit at the hands of France was littered with 'what ifs?' for the beaten side.

Looking to beat France for the first time since 2017 - and reach the last four of the global showpiece for the first time since 2014 - Ireland will feel they had the game in their grasp at Sandy Park only to let it slip in a second half during which they conceded 18 unanswered points.

Yet, when the dust settles, a side who did not even qualify for the last edition of the tournament and were whitewashed in the Six Nations as recently as 2023, will surely view the past four weeks as further progress.

"I'm really proud of the group and where they've come from in the two years," said head coach Scott Bemand in the immediate aftermath of the defeat in Exeter.

"You think a year ago that the group might have felt the occasion more, but I could see it in the eyes of the players when they stepped off the bus... our group don't get daunted by that any more. They get excited by it."

Under the former England assistant coach, Ireland's progress from the nadir of their failure to make it to New Zealand three years ago and all that followed has been quicker than most dared to expect.

Qualification for this tournament with more than a year to spare thanks to a third-place finish in the 2024 Six Nations followed by wins over Australia and the Black Ferns in the same calendar year represented a rapid turnaround.

Centre Aoife Dalton described Sunday's effort against France when compared to the performances of two years ago as like "chalk and cheese", yet this was an Ireland team that clearly felt they were ready to take the next step with a big scalp on the biggest stage.

"We felt like we had it," said a crestfallen Dalton.

"Saying all that, we can be proud of what we did out there. I can't pick a player who didn't leave everything out there so we can definitely be proud of that performance. It's just going to hurt for a while."

Dalton is just 22. With Wafer, who was sensational in her first Test appearance since April, the same age and fly-half Dannah O'Brien a year younger, there is a nucleus of a side that will be expected to drive things forward not just across the next four-year cycle but beyond.

Indeed, of Sunday's starting line-up, only winger Amee-Leigh Costigan and lock Sam Monaghan have celebrated their 30th birthdays.

"It is a young group," said Monaghan, the Gloucester-Hartpury lock who returned from 13 months on the sidelines to lead Ireland at the tournament.

"You know, only one player [Cliodhna Moloney-MacDonald] out of 32 has experienced a World Cup before.

"If you look back two years ago, we were competing in WX3, and we were very, very close to winning a World Cup quarter-final there.

"We're gutted, we're heartbroken. We know we could have had that game, but we'll hold our heads high, rebuild and go again."

For that, they will have to wait until the 2026 Six Nations, when it is hoped the side's growing support, dubbed 'the green wave' by players, will be out in force for what will be a historic first stand-alone fixture in Aviva Stadium against Scotland in May.

In the longer term, there will surely be efforts to secure the future of their head coach beyond next year.

Bemand replaced Gregg McWilliams on a three-year deal in August 2023 and said it would be "brilliant" if he was to lead the side past the expiration of that initial contract. 

Regardless, he sounded sure of the direction of travel.

"In terms of what we're doing it doesn't feel like we're anywhere near the end point," he said.

"The story's still being written and if it's me to go forward, if I'm the right fit, if it works for myself and the players, then brilliant. 

"We keep talking about taking this next step and cracking into the World Cup contenders. It's gutting to not do it [on Sunday], especially when we look back on it.

"It's going to happen at some point."

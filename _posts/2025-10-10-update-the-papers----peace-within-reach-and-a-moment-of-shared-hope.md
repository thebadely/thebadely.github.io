Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Images of Israelis and Palestinians celebrating the prospect of the end of the war in Gaza are on almost every front page. "A moment of shared hope" is The Daily Mirror's headline. In an editorial it urges the US and its allies in the Middle East to make sure the ceasefire deal leads to a comprehensive peace settlement, because it says it could all still go wrong. The paper says Israel could renege on the deal and resume the war after the hostages come home, while a loose-cannon terrorist could deliberately derail the peace process.

"Trump's peace" declares The Daily Express. It says the US president looks to have pulled off the unthinkable, the prospect of peace in the Middle East. And a similar point is made in The Daily Mail's editorial. It says liberals love to portray the US president as stupid, but through sheer force of personality he has compelled Israel and Hamas to sign a tentative accord.

The Daily Telegraph warns that sticking points remain among Trump's vague 20-point framework. A senior Hamas official is quoted as saying the group couldn't accept the president's proposal for a "Board of Peace" - led by him - to oversea Gaza.

The Financial Times highlights uncertainties about two other points: Hamas hasn't yet agreed to disarm itself, and it's unclear which countries would be willing to contribute troops to the international stabilisation force that should be deployed in Gaza.

A report in The Guardian says Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has told an event for a private US Christian college in Michigan that the "Marxist left" is "in control" of Britain's education system. The paper says he suggested there would a huge overhaul of the system and potentially the curriculum if his party won the next general election. The National Education Union has described the comments as "nonsense". Reform didn't reply to the paper's request for comment.

And finally, on its front page, The Sun says that even Sir David Beckham, described as one of Britain's best looking men, snores. His wife, Victoria, who is promoting a documentary about her life, told the paper that she sleeps with earplugs, because she can't ignore his snoring and doesn't want to banish him to another room.

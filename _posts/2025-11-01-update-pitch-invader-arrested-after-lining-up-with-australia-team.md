According to new developments, The pitch invader (left) lined up with the Australia team during the national anthems

A pitch invader who lined up with the Australia team before Saturday's rugby league Test against England has been arrested.

Daniel Jarvis, a well-known internet prankster who goes by the name 'Jarvo 69' on social media, got on to the field as the teams lined up for the national anthems shortly before kick-off at Everton's Hill Dickinson Stadium.

Jarvis was captured on BBC One's television coverage standing at the end of the line of Australia players, wearing a green and gold team shirt with 'Jarvo 69' on the back.

Merseyside Police said: "We can confirm that officers have detained a man following an incident at Hill Dickinson Stadium, Liverpool this afternoon, Saturday, 1 November.

"The 37-year-old man from Gravesend, Kent, was detained at around 2.30pm after entering the pitch before the start of the the England v Australia rugby league match.

"He has been arrested on suspicion of possession of articles for use in fraud and fraud by false representation, and has been taken to a police station for questioning."

Neither Everton nor the Rugby Football League commented when approached by BBC Sport.

But it is understood that the incident will form part of an RFL internal review of the event.

Saturday's match was the first non-football event held at Everton's new stadium since it opened earlier this year.

Australia won the match 14-4, to secure victory in the three-Test series with a game to spare. The third and final Test will take place at AMT Headingley, in Leeds, next Saturday.

'When you are Liverpool, the aim is to win the league' - is Slot under pressure?

Arne Slot believes his Liverpool side can still achieve "very special things" this season but refused to discuss what an "acceptable" outcome would look like.

Liverpool have won just five of their past 18 Premier League games, leading to "noise" that is making life uncomfortable for the head coach and his players.

Slot says Liverpool may struggle to "shut down" criticism, given the trophy holders appear to be already out of the domestic title race.

However, they can secure automatic qualification for the Champions League last-16 stage when they take on Qarabag on Wednesday.

Slot's team could have a deep run in Europe and they also remain in the FA Cup.

"If we can improve in both boxes, we can do very special things this season," Slot said.

"But if we can only improve in one box, then it will probably be an acceptable season but not more than that.

"And if we can't improve in both boxes, there's going to be a lot of noise."

'Liverpool's struggles can no longer be hidden by long unbeaten run'

Pushed on what his definition of an "acceptable" season would be, Slot said: "When you are Liverpool, the aim is to win the league. We've only done this twice in the last 30 years. The aim is to be competitive in every single competition we are in.

"That's always the aim, but the reality is that in the last three years we've won one League Cup and one Premier League title.

"What is acceptable? I have my opinion but I'm not going to share that.

"The outside world has an opinion. As we all know, a lot has been said about the Â£450m [that Liverpool spent in the summer], but people tend to forget the Â£300m we bought in."

Liverpool are sixth in the Premier League and have won none of their past five games (D4, L1) in the competition.

"I think it's going to be really difficult to quiet the outside noise with the position we are in in the league," Slot said. "So even if we win a few games, every loss or every disappointing result will start the noise coming back again.

"That's what you can expect if you started the season as we did - not started, but at a certain moment with so many losses. So it's impossible to shut down the noise at a club like this if you are not competing for the league."

The Liverpool boss expects a tough challenge against a Qarabag side who held Chelsea to a draw earlier in the season.

Liverpool sit fourth in the group phase entering the final round of games, with the top eight going through to the last-16 stage automatically.

A defeat could knock them out of that group of eight, so Slot wants to impress on his players the need to be wary of Qarabag's threat. The visitors to Anfield sit 18th in the 36-team league table.

"It is always the players that make things difficult. They are very direct, fast players," Slot said of the opposition.

"They go very direct and fast towards goal and have players who are comfortable on the ball. They have shown against big clubs that they are a very good team. Even Chelsea, they were able to keep them to 2-2.

"If you look at our Champions League this season, some clubs are lucky to face the teams who are outside and in the bottom 10. We only played one [Eintracht Frankfurt]. We did really well, but maybe it has given us some problems in the league game or two games later."

Andy Robertson's move to Tottenham now looks unlikely and Slot confirmed that he expects his vice-captain to stay at the club.

Tottenham and Liverpool were in talks for the left-back to make the move in a deal worth Â£5m, but as it stands Liverpool are not in a position to sell Robertson, who is out of contract in the summer, without having a replacement left-back.

Liverpool have so far been unable to recall Kostas Tsimikas from his loan at Roma.

"Robbo is part of the team tomorrow evening and he has been part of this club for so many years. I'm happy to have him and it's good that he is available," said Slot.

Asked if Robertson was staying at Liverpool, Slot added: "It is hard to say anything definite in this world we are in, but I expect him to."

The Liverpool boss also confirmed Joe Gomez will miss the game against Qarabag with a hip injury after he was forced off in the 3-2 defeat at Bournemouth, but Slot insisted the defender would only be out for a "relatively short amount of time".

Ibrahima Konate is still absent due to a death in his family, and Slot is in touch with the France international.

"He's having a hard time. I'm hoping and expecting him back soon, but he's not available for tomorrow," said Slot.

With Virgil van Dijk the only senior centre-back available, Slot intends to field a midfielder alongside his captain at the back. Wataru Endo played there in the game at Bournemouth on Saturday.

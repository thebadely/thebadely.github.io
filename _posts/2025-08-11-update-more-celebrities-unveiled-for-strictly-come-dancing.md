Experts revealed that Love Island winner Dani Dyer, actress Alex Kingston and ex-footballer Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink will be among the celebrities taking part in the new series of Strictly Come Dancing, the BBC has announced.

The trio were unveiled on BBC One's The One Show on Monday, as the line-up for Strictly's 23rd series starts to take shape.

The only other contestant to have been revealed so far is Olympic sprinter Harry Aikines-Aryeetey, known to Gladiators fans as Nitro, with the other celebrities expected to be confirmed in the coming days.

Strictly Come Dancing will air on BBC One and iPlayer from September to December.

Here is the line-up so far:

The English actress is known for starring in TV shows like hit US medical drama ER (playing Dr Elizabeth Corday from 1997 to 2004), Doctor Who (as River Song between 2008 and 2015) and 1996's The Fortunes and Misfortunes of Moll Flanders (which earned her a Bafta nomination for playing the title role).

The 62-year-old has also appeared in films including Croupier and Boudica, and her stage credits range from playing Lady Macbeth opposite Sir Kenneth Branagh to Nurse Ratched in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.

In a statement announcing her participation in Strictly, she said: "Aaaaagghhh!!!!!!"

Dani Dyer shot to fame when she starred on Love Island in 2018, winning the reality TV show with Jack Fincham. They split later that year, and she married West Ham striker Jarrod Bowen this May.â€‹

"Getting the opportunity to be on Strictly is the second most amazing thing I've done this year!" the 29-year-old said. "I feel very very blessed and cannot wait to get my dancing shoes on."

She is also known for teaming up with her dad, actor Danny Dyer, for a string of projects including podcasts Sorted with the Dyers and Live and Let Dyers, and travelogue series Absolutely Dyer: Danny and Dani Do Italy.

The Dutch footballer was one of the most prolific strikers in the Premier League in the late 1990s with Leeds United, and with Chelsea in the early 2000s. He won 23 caps for the Netherlands.

He has gone on to manage clubs including Queens Park Rangers, Northampton Town and Burton Albion, and was a coach for the England national side alongside Gareth Southgate.

"Swapping the pitch for the ballroom is certainly not something I've done before but I'm looking forward to tackling a fun challenge!" said Hasselbaink, 53. "Bring on a new type of footwork, with hopefully no own goals."

Aikines-Aryeetey is a former Team GB sprinter and was the first athlete to win gold medals at both 100m and 200m at the World Youth Championships. In 2005, aged 17, he was won the BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year award.

He has competed at two Olympic Games and is a three-time European champion and two-time Commonwealth champion.

In 2023, he was unveiled as Nitro in Gladiators, and took part in last year's Strictly Come Dancing Christmas Special partnered with Nancy Xu.

"I'm so excited to be part of the Strictly family this series and I'm ready to give it all I've got," the 36-year-old said.

Two new professional dancers are also joining the line-up this year - Alexis Warr, who won US dance series So You Think You Can Dance in 2022, and Australian-born Julian Caillon, who has appeared as a professional dancer on three seasons of Australia's Dancing With The Stars. 

Last year's series was won by comedian Chris McCausland, who became the programme's first blind victor, with dance partner Dianne Buswell.

But the show, which has been airing since 2004, has also faced a number of controversies over the past year relating to the behaviour of some of its professional dancers and celebrity guests.

Last week, the BBC launched an investigation into alleged drug use by two Strictly stars, who have not been named, after The Sun on Sunday reported alleged cocaine use.

Meanwhile, professional dancers Giovanni Pernice and Graziano Di Prima left the show last year following allegations about their behaviour towards their dance partners.

The BBC announced new welfare measures for Strictly last July. These include having chaperones in all rehearsal rooms, adding two new welfare producers and providing additional training for the professional dancers, production team and crew.

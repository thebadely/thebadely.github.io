It has been recently reported that Paddy Pimblett has had seven fights in the UFC, while Justin Gaethje has had eight years competing in the MMA promotion

Justin Gaethje is confident he can "teach" Paddy Pimblett "some lessons" when the pair meet in the octagon on Saturday at UFC 324.

The lightweights will contest the interim title in Las Vegas, with the experienced 37-year-old Gaethje admitting he is the underdog.

Pimblett, 31, said he expects to finish Gaethje within three rounds and described the American as a "boxer with leg kicks".

"I hope he's overconfident in himself, just like I was when I was 30 years old, so I can teach him some lessons," Gaethje told BBC Sport.

"This is 25 minutes in time. Nothing from the past, nothing from the future can determine it. It's about being perfect. Who's more perfect? Who makes mistakes? Who doesn't make mistakes, who's more prepared?

"I want to take Paddy into the fourth, fifth round. Really hurt him, and I'm looking forward to it."

Pimblett is well known to have a knack of getting under the skin of his opponents and said this week he thinks he can retire Gaethje with a dominant performance on Saturday.

Gaethje, who held the interim lightweight UFC title in 2020, says he loves being the underdog and believes he fights better under pressure.

"The more I hear him talk, the more I want to hurt him," Gaethje said.

"He's weird. But in a good way. He goes left when you're supposed to go right. And these are things that I'm going to have to figure out early. 

"Great grappling, terrible wrestler. So we'll see if you can take me down."

Asked for a prediction, Gaethje says he envisions Pimblett "asleep".

"I just have to turn his lights off for one second," he added.

According to new developments, People who receive an annual financial bonus to support with the rising cost of living will be sent it earlier than usual, the Jersey government says.

The Community Costs Bonus has been brought forward from autumn to July, with some families having already received the £516.50 automatically.

The Minister for Social Security Deputy Lyndsay Feltham said she had further extended the bonus for another year and brought it forward to "help families as soon as possible".

The government said eligible applicants could only apply if one adult had lived in Jersey for at least five years, their combined tax liability was less than £2,735 in 2024 and the household was not receiving income support.

The government said an estimated funding of £2.2m had been allocated for the continued support of the scheme from existing departmental budgets.

Let's dive into the details: Rangers slid to another sorry defeat on their travels

After Rangers' opening-day draw at Motherwell, Russell Martin contended that what was undermining his team was "not really tactical, it's a mentality problem".

That was two months ago. Yet when he spoke following the haphazard 2-1 Europa League defeat on Thursday, there was a enervating familiarity about how the Rangers head coach explained away the outcome.

"It's mentality, not a technical or tactical problem," Martin said.

Another game, another Groundhog Day for Rangers.

What unfolds on the pitch is predictable, while Martin's assessment has a sense of the inevitable about it too.

There is nothing to be said about the slow start and shoddy defending that allowed Sturm Graz to take command of this Europa League tie that hasn't already been exhausted by players, pundits and punters alike.

The common denominator is that there is a problem at Ibrox. The weekly protests point to that. The five wins in 16 games make it even more obvious.

So, for how much longer can Rangers and Martin work from the same script and wish for something different?

Besides the small step on the road to recovery that was the Scottish Premiership win at Livingston at the weekend, Rangers haven't managed to lose sight of the starting blocks.

In Austria, they had an opportunity to build a bit of momentum and make a case for their head coach, who remains under huge pressure.

Instead, a poor throw-in from James Tavernier was lofted forward by Dimitri Lavalee, controlled by Maurice Malone, and finished by Tomi Horvat. Seven minutes had elapsed.

If that was a defensive mishap, the second goal was a defensive calamity.

A high line at a deep free-kick was sliced open with one delightful daisy-cutter, and a scrambling Jack Butland was left blushing for a second time in the first half.

"Schoolboy stuff," said former Rangers right-back Alan Hutton.

Two mistakes due to the Ibrox side's mentality, according to Martin. Nothing to do with their set-up, system or style.

"The difference from the first half-hour to the next 60 minutes was too far apart really," the head coach said. "It's concentration, it's mentality.

"I'm frustrated because we give away two poor goals, soft goals. We did so much work on them recently we were just not alive.

"We hurt ourselves because they didn't create anything from open play. It's hurtful and frustrating."

Rangers hirpled on until half-time. Then things changed.

Jayden Meghoma and Oliver Antman were swapped for Max Aarons and Bojan Miovski in what were far from like-for-like changes.

It meant Derek Cornelius was shunted to left-back, with Tavernier at centre-back. Eye-popping on paper, positive on the pitch.

With a new lease of life about them - though not quite the domination Martin suggested - Djeidi Gassama deservedly hauled one back for Rangers. 

But as has been the case so often this season, the architects of their own downfall didn't attempt to recover until the damage was done.

"We were naive and found ourselves down at 2-0, then we were chasing the game," Cornelius told TNT Sports.

"We didn't start well, I don't know what the problem is. It seems like there's moments where everyone is switched on and tuned in and then it can switch, I don't know why.

"We can't be accepting of that. We can't be like this. We need to react."

David: Just go. It's just absolute drivel every time Martin opens his mouth. He must be watching different games to everyone else. Totally delusional.

Steve: There is clearly a disconnect between the manager and the players. If they can't implement simple tactics such as how to correctly defend a throw-in, then something is badly wrong.

Robert: Martin has to go before this is allowed to get any worse. I don't even get surprised anymore at Rangers losing, its becoming the norm. Next home match attendance will be interesting.

Stewart: Real leaders don't blame their men. For too long Martin has ignored his very open tactics when looking at a match. He has to leave. Defending is part of football. He clearly does not coach it.

Sandra: What on earth was that waffle in the post-match interview? Dreadful and totally demoralising.

Experts revealed that Kelsey Jones started at hooker in Wales' opening World Cup game

Women's Rugby World Cup 2025: Canada v Wales

Venue: Salford Community Stadium Date: Saturday, 30 August Kick-off: 12:00 BST

Coverage: Live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer, BBC Sport website & app, Radio Wales, Radio Cymru and BBC Sounds

Kelsey Jones says Wales will have "nothing to lose" and must back themselves when they take on Pool B favourites Canada at the Rugby World Cup.

Wales suffered a shock 38-8 defeat by Scotland in their opening game, which realistically means they must beat the second best team in the world next if they are to challenge for the quarter-finals.

Canada have already laid down a marker with their 65-7 victory over Fiji.

"Right now it's pure disappointment and frustration," said Wales hooker Jones.

"We're absolutely gutted, but it's a really good opportunity now to reflect.

"We've got nothing to lose, we need to step it up and go against Canada - and a great opportunity against Fiji as well. You never know what can happen, I'm optimistic."

Scotland versus Wales had been billed as the make-or-break match for both sides, with Canada tipped to top the pool.

Despite their off-field issues involving player contracts, Scotland delivered an impressive six-try display of solidarity against a woeful Wales.

"That was our cup final, that's how we saw it," said Jones.

"Unfortunately we weren't good enough. Fair play to Scotland, they turned up and proved a point."

Wales return to Salford Community Stadium to take on Canada on Saturday and Jones sees it as an opportunity to redeem themselves.

"There are things that we've got to look forward to, we're playing in a World Cup and what an occasion it is," she said.

"You never know what can happen in rugby, it depends on who turns up on the day, so we're really excited for the opportunity to go out there at least two more times.

"Canada is going to be a huge challenge, we know that they're physical.

"We say 'we're going to be a hard team to beat', unfortunately we didn't prove that, so I think we have an opportunity to prove that we can be a hard team to beat.

"We'll just throw it all at Canada and see what we can do."

Wales came in for some criticism after their performance, but Jones has urged the fans to stick with them.

"We love your support, we love inspiring that next generation. That's something we really pride ourselves on, making sure we see people after the game," she said.

"Please turn up, please come and support us. Nothing changes, we go again and we're still the same Welsh team and we want to put our best foot forward."

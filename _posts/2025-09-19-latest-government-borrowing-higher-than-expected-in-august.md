According to new developments, UK government borrowing was higher than expected in August, according to the latest official figures.

Borrowing - the difference between public spending and tax income - was £18bn in August. That was up £3.5bn from the same month last year and the highest August borrowing for five years, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.

The UK statistics body said that while tax and National Insurance receipts were higher, they were outstripped by increased spending on public services, benefits and debt interest.

Borrowing over the first five months of the financial year has now reached £83.8bn, the ONS said, which is up £16.2bn from the same period last year.

Let's dive into the details: TikTokers are helping put the centuries-old Hull Fair on the global map. One senior official at the city council describes the power they hold as "amazing", while a TikToker followed by millions says honest and relatable content is key to their success.

Characters such as Kalani Ghost Hunter, Redheadresidence and PT Vlogs UK all paid a visit this year and received thousands - in some cases millions - of views for their content.

Followers saw their idols tuck into delicacies such as foot-long fries, chat with locals and sample some of the hair-raising rides.

The annual event, which attracts about half-a-million thrill-seekers each year, wrapped up its 731st year last weekend - and Helen Thackeray, events and sports ground safety manager at Hull City Council, is left in no doubt as to the role played by social media.

 "The reach that social media influencers have got and the power they're able to generate through that is amazing," she says.

"The distance that people are travelling to the fair is growing without a doubt."

Ms Thackeray says visitor numbers were "still growing steadily" year-on-year.

"Social media has been a massive part of that extended draw of Hull Fair," she reports.

"We're now getting social influencers turning up and that gives you a whole different parameter than what you used to have with maybe one or two news outlets and radio stations."

US TikToker Kalani Smith has more than three million followers and is known online as Kalani Ghost Hunter.

The 27-year-old frequently travels to the UK and is known for trying local delicacies.

A video showing his visit to Hull Fair this year received more than 222,000 views and 16,000 likes on TikTok.

Kalani went on The Fighter ride, braved the Big Ben Tower which is 280ft (85m) high, enjoyed fries with chip spice and was even given cash by someone to try roasted chestnuts.

He says a lot of people recommended the fair to him as it is "so well-known and a massive thing".

Kalani believes his content connects as he is "a genuine bloke living his best life".

Reflecting on why TikTok content can do so well, he says: "I think social media showcases things from a different perspective. You follow someone you genuinely trust and believe in their reviews. That can be more of a driving force than putting up a billboard or an advert."

Paul, 37, from Blackpool, runs a TikTok account called PT Vlogs UK. He has 125,000 followers and posts fairground content.

He posted a video of the Ice Jet Matterhorn ride from the fair this year which received more than seven million views.

Paul says: "People see it and want to feel that atmosphere based on the videos alone, it can ignite that love and need to actually go to the fairground.

"Banners on the M62 don't go far enough to people that are down south but social media is in the palm of their hands.

"It's shaping the future of advertisement."

This year, Joel Redhead, 31, from Hull, visited the fair with fellow TikTokers The Coles.

Joel, known on TikTok as Redheadresidence, says: "Back in the day they would have advertised Hull Fair through the paper, leaflets, and then to radio and TV.

"I feel like social media is the next stage in promotion for the future."

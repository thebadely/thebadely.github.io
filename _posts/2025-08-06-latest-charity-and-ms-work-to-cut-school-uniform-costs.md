It has been recently reported that A Jersey charity and a retailer have been working together to reduce school uniform costs.

When parents donate used uniforms to Autism Jersey's boutique shop, they are given a 10% voucher for new uniforms at Marks & Spencer (M&S).

It comes as many families said they were struggling with the cost of living in the island and school uniforms were a serious pressure on some of them.

Parents have to buy up to five compulsory school uniform items in public and non-fee-paying schools, whereas, in the UK, the limit is three items, which puts greater pressures on families in the island.

Sonja Meacock is the manager of Autism Jersey's boutique shop and has two young children.

She said: "Everyone is struggling at the moment... a lot of our customers are having to choose between feeding their children or buying school uniform."

"Uniform is a priority for our children – they need it so they feel comfortable in class – and it should a basic. But it costs me about £100 to £200 per child for those going to secondary school, so it's really expensive."

Jersey's Education Department was asked to comment on the concerns of the cost of school uniforms but has not responded.

Lesley Harrison, from Autism Jersey, helped set up the campaign with M&S.

She said: "There is a lot of pressure on families trying to feed, clothe and house their children... We wanted to make sure we could create some support for them.

"We'd like to encourage other retailers to collaborate as well, so we hope this could be a regular fixture in our calendar because it is proving popular."

The current offer lasts until 27 September.

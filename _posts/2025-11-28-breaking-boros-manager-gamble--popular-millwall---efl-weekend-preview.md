According to new developments, Kim Hellberg (left) makes his debut as Middlesbrough boss this weekend while Alex Neil's Millwall are surprising everyone in the Championship

Just like Black Friday, football seems to be an everyday experience in the modern world.

Fortunately Saturday, at least for now, still remains the traditional day for us to get our regular fix and this weekend brings us another chance to delight in the unpredictable world that is the EFL.

There is a new manager making his debut at Middlesbrough, another boss under pressure at West Brom and Millwall cooking up a storm against the odds.

In League One, Michael Duff 's stock is back on the rise at Wycombe Wanderers while in League Two Bromley are raising eyebrows, as we look at just five things you may want to watch out for this weekend.

Kim Hellberg started his coaching career when he was 23

Life is full of decisions and Kim Hellberg may have had a few sleepless nights plotting his next move up the managerial ladder.

Having already been courted by Swansea and linked with Norwich it was Middlesbrough who got him to ditch Stockholm for Teesside.

Is it a gamble? Possibly, given he has no experience of English football - but then again how do you gain that experience in the first place? And he is coming from Hammarby, who average more than 24,000 fans for home games, so he is not about to be overawed.

Having watched a 4-2 home defeat by Championship leaders Coventry on Tuesday the 37-year-old is in at the deep end on Saturday against in-form Derby (15:00 GMT).

"I am proud to be here and also for working very hard for 15 years as a coach to get here - from the lowest division in Sweden to England is a big step," he told BBC Radio Tees.

That first big step brings Derby to the Riverside with the Rams' six wins from their past seven games having propelled them up to eighth place - some going when you consider they won only one of their opening 10.

They will be without top-scorer Carlton Morris until at least March and with the big striker having scored 10 goals in 15 appearances, Derby must now prove they are not a one-trick pony.

Ryan Mason has won six of his 18 games in charge of West Brom

Invariably in football when one manager is replaced the spotlight falls on who might be next to start feeling the pressure - it is a lovely industry isn't it?

When head coaches start quibbling about their fixture schedule it never feels like a great move but that is what Ryan Mason has felt the need to mention on the back of a run which has produced one win from seven outings as they prepare to host Swansea (15:00 GMT), who recently swapped Alan Sheehan for Vitor Matos.

"In the past six weeks we've had to play away from home twice Wednesday and Saturday and both times against a team who played at home on the Wednesday," Mason told BBC Radio WM.

"I thought we'd have the advantage this time but for some strange reason we have to play at home to a side that's played 24 hours before us.

"I've had a look at every other team's scheduling and fixture list and for some reason we're coming off the worst end of it."

It may not be an advantage but the Baggies will face a Swansea side on a four-match losing streak, including a defeat by Derby on Tuesday in Matos' first game in charge.

Millwall have not been in English football's top flight for 35 years

"No-one likes us, we don't care" is a familiar refrain from the stands at The Den but this country does love an underdog so, could Millwall be the feelgood story of the season?

With "an injury list as long as my arm" and a budget more Aldi than Selfridges, boss Alex Neil might be working miracles to have them in the rarefied heights of fourth place.

"We've won four out of five at home, we're fourth in the table with an injury list as long as my arm since the start of the season and it's just continued, so for the lads to be where they are, they deserve a huge amount of credit for that," Neil told BBC Radio London.

Millwall's credentials can expect a thorough workout when Southampton roll into SE16 (15:00 GMT).

As auditions for a job go it is doubtful many have been as successful as Saints' interim boss Tonda Eckert, whose four wins from four attempts surely make it only a case of 'when' rather than 'if' he gets the permanent role.

Michael Duff began his managerial career at Cheltenham Town

Leading Cheltenham to promotion from League Two and Barnsley to the League One play-off final had plenty of glances of admiration in the direction of Michael Duff.

But, 21 months later and after unsuccessful stints at Swansea and Huddersfield, the former Burnley defender's star was waning and had him possibly wondering when his next opportunity might arrive.

Fortunately he and Wycombe found each other in September and both are making the most of it.

Since Duff's appointment the Chairboys have lost just one of his nine league games and no side in League One has taken more than their 14 points in their past six matches, which has left them only four short of the top six.

Fourth in that form guide are Rotherham, another resurgent side after a slow start, and that's where Wycombe head to on Saturday (15:00 GMT).

Michael Cheek (right) has scored more than 130 goals for Bromley

If the National League was looking for any more ammunition for its 3UP campaign then they could do worse than use Bromley.

In just their second season in the EFL they could finish Saturday top of the pile in League Two.

To do so they will need to win at the current leaders Walsall (15:00 GMT) and hope Swindon slip up at Chesterfield - but don't let that get in the way of the story which is the job Andy Woodman and his team have done so far.

Spearheaded by their top scorer from the past six seasons Michael Cheek, who already has eight this season, Bromley boast the division's best home record and a four-match winning streak has pushed them into the promotion picture.

"It's a huge game already this early in the season," Cheek told BBC Radio London.

"Year on year we seem to get better it seems, there were possibly too many draws at the start of the season but it looks like we have that winning formula now."

Walsall have been here before and plenty has been written about the 12-point lead they blew at the top last season but although they are top again, successive home defeats will give Bromley plenty of encouragement.

BBC Sport will have live text coverage of all the EFL action this weekend starting with Oxford United v Ipswich Town on Friday evening.

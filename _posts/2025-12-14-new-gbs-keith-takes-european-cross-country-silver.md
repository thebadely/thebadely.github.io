Let's dive into the details: Keith took part in the 10,000m at the 2024 Olympics in Paris 

Great Britain and Northern Ireland's Megan Keith claimed silver behind Italy's Nadia Battocletti in the women's race at the European Cross Country Championships in Portugal.

Battocletti, who became the first woman in championship history last year to win individual titles at Under-20, U23 and senior level, won in 24 minutes 52 seconds.

Keith, who is from Inverness, crossed the line in 25:07 and Turkey's Yasemin Can was third in 25:13, while Great Britain were second behind Belgium in the team standings for the women's race.

In the men's race, Briton Scott Beattie had to settle for fourth, despite throwing himself across the finish line in a tight finish with Switzerland's Dominic Lobalu.

They were both given a time of 22:23 behind Spanish winner Thierry Ndikumwenayo, who clocked 22:05, and France's Jimmy Gressier, who was second in 22:08.

Britain's Innes Fitzgerald had earlier put in an impressive performance to win a third successive gold in the women's U20 race.

She won in 14:35, with France's Lucie Paturel second in 15:07 and Emma Hickey, 16, of Ireland third in 15:10 as Britain won the team event in the category.

A mixed relay team of Holly Dixon, Ava Lloyd, Callum Elson and Jack Higgins also won a medal as they claimed bronze behind winners Italy and second-placed Portugal.

Ireland's Nick Griggs won the U23 men's title.

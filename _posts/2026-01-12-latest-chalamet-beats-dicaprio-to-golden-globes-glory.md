Here’s what you need to know: Timothée Chalamet was among the main winners as Hollywood's finest gathered for this year's Golden Globe Awards.

Chalamet, 30, continued his pursuit of greatness, and an Oscar, by beating stars including Leonardo DiCaprio and George Clooney to the award for best actor in a musical or comedy for table tennis caper Marty Supreme.

Despite DiCaprio missing out, his film One Battle After Another won the most awards overall, with four prizes including best musical or comedy film and best director.

Irish actress Jessie Buckley was named best drama actress for Hamnet, which also scored a surprise win in the best drama film category.

Vampire thriller Sinners had been considered the frontrunner, but it instead went home with the box office achievement prize as well as best score.

The Golden Globes are a key stop on the road to the Academy Awards, and other acting winners on Sunday included Teyana Taylor, Rose Byrne, Wagner Moura and Stellan Skarsgård.

Unlike the Oscars, the Globes also reward TV shows, and the night saw British actors Stephen Graham, Owen Cooper and Erin Doherty pick up more honours for their performances in Netflix drama Adolescence.

With all eyes on the Oscars race, Timothée Chalamet's victory has given him a boost over his rivals. "I'm in a category with many greats," he said when accepting his trophy.

It was Chalamet's fifth Globes nomination, but his first win. "My dad instilled in me a spirit of gratitude growing up, always be grateful for what you have," he said. 

"It's allowed me to leave this ceremony in the past empty handed, my head held high, grateful just to be here. But I'd be lying if I didn't say those moments make this moment that much sweeter.

"For my parents, for my partner, I love you so much," he added, looking at girlfriend Kylie Jenner.

Jessie Buckley was named best actress for her role in the adaptation of Maggie O'Farrell's best-selling novel Hamnet, about the death of William Shakespeare's son.

"This is not a normal feeling or situation to be in," she said in her acceptance speech.

"It was such an extraordinary set to be part of, because we were telling the story of probably the most  famous Brit that ever lived, and we had a Chinese director, a lot of Irish, a mostly Polish crew, beside our British family."

She concluded: "This is a real honour, I love being part of this industry."

Shortly afterwards, Hamnet director Chloe Zhao looked visibly shocked when the movie was announced as the winner of best drama film.

Accepting the prize, producer Steven Spielberg said he had "loved the book" by O'Farrell, but felt Zhao was "the only film-maker on the face of the planet who could tell the story".

Zhao said: "The village of Hamnet that made this film together. Some of them lost their loved ones while we were making this film, and some of them are still struggling, and I just wanted to say we're thinking of you, we're here because of you, we love you."

Elsewhere, singer and actress Teyana Taylor, whose career started when she choreographed a Beyonce music video at the age of 15, cemented her Hollywood breakthrough by winning best supporting film actress for One Battle After Another.

After tearfully thanking a list of people, she used her acceptance speech to send a message to "my brown sisters and little brown girls watching tonight".

"Our light does not need permission to shine," she told them. "We belong in every room we walk into. Our voices matter and our dreams deserve space."

Swedish actor Stellan Skarsgård, 74, won best supporting actor for Sentimental Value, and joked that he hadn't prepared a speech "because I thought that I was too old".

He then made an impassioned plea for people to see films like his on the big screen. "Cinema should be seen in cinemas," he said to cheers from the crowd.

Australia's Rose Byrne was named best actress in a film musical or comedy for If I Had Legs I'd Kick You, and paid tribute to members of her family.

"My brother's my date. Thanks, George," she laughed. "Thanks to my mum and dad, who bought Paramount+ so they could watch the Golden Globes from Sydney.

"And I want to thank my husband, Bobby Cannavale. He couldn't be here because, um, we're getting a bearded dragon, and he went to a reptile expo in New Jersey. So thank you, baby."

Meanwhile, KPop Demon Hunters won best animated film and best song for Golden.

Brazilian political thriller The Secret Agent was named best international film, while its star Wagner Moura won best drama actor.

"This is a film about generational trauma," Moura said, "and I think that if trauma can be passed along generations, values can too. So this is to the ones that are sticking with their values in difficult moments."

Paul Thomas Anderson won best film director and screenplay for One Battle After Another.

"You guys are being so generous with this affection for me and this film," Anderson said, adding: "I love doing what I do."

British teenager Owen Cooper continued a year of adulation and awards acclaim for his performance in Adolescence, winning best TV supporting actor.

The 16-year-old from Warrington appears to be keeping his feet on the ground, telling the assembled A-listers: "I'm still very much an apprentice. I'm still learning every day. I'm still learning from the people that are sitting in front of you and sitting in front of me."

And he still seems in disbelief at his meteoric rise, remarking: "It's mad, what is going on?" before signing off with the motto of his beloved Liverpool FC: "You'll never walk alone."

Seth Rogen also won a TV prize, and had a sense of deja-vu after setting an epsiode of his Apple TV comedy The Studio at the Golden Globes.

"This is so weird, we just pretended to do this and now it's happening," he said when picking up the trophy for best TV comedy actor.

"I thought the only way I would get to hold one is to create a whole show to give myself a fake one."

Other TV winners included Jean Smart for Hacks, Noah Wyle for The Pitt and Michelle Williams for Dying for Sex.

And the event's first ever award for best podcast went to Amy Poehler, a former Golden Globes host, for Good Hang with Amy Poehler.

Here’s what you need to know: Many of the papers carry reaction to US President Donald Trump's description of Europe as "weak" and "decaying". "Trump lashes out," says the Metro. "Eurotrashed" is the Sun's headline. For the i Paper, the UK and its allies are facing a "huge reality check". The Guardian says that, as Trump was "doubling down" on his administration's recent criticism of Europe, he also "hinted" he could walk away from supporting Kyiv.

The Financial Times focuses on the latest developments to try to bring Russia's war in Ukraine to an end. The paper says Trump's envoys have given Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky "days" to respond to a proposed deal which would require Ukraine to accept territorial losses in exchange for unspecified US security guarantees.

According to the Times, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood is considering plans to cut the number of police forces in England and Wales from the present 43 to as few as 12. It's said to be one of a range of options being looked at to try to make the police more efficient and cost-effective. The Home Office hasn't commented on the report.

The Daily Telegraph says research has revealed that the busiest time in accident and emergency departments in the UK is 19:00 on a Monday. The study, carried out by the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, also suggests that on an average day almost a fifth of patients in UK emergency departments are being cared for in corridors and waiting rooms. A spokesman for the Department of Health said corridor care was "undignified and had no place in the NHS".

The Guardian and the i have both picked up on a study which says the average cost of a Christmas dinner for four is a few pence less than last year - at £32.46. But according to the market research firm Worldpanel the price of another festive staple, chocolate, has increased by 18% on this time last year after poor cocoa harvests.

And photographs of the presenter Claudia Winkleman receiving her MBE at Windsor Castle feature on many of the front pages. In a nod to one of the programmes she hosts - "The Traitors" - the Telegraph's headline calls her a "faithful servant".

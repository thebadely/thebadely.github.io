According to new developments, Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars and Kendrick Lamar lead the nominations for this year's MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs).

Sabrina Carpenter and Ariana Grande are also among the most nominated artists for the 2025 US award show.

Beyoncé and Taylor Swift, who are tied for most VMA wins with 30 each, have received one nomination this year - both in the artist of the year category. 

Neither artist released an album in the past year, but both artists have undertaken blockbuster tours in that period. 

Swift already holds the crown for most Moonman trophies for a single artist, as Beyoncé's tally includes collaborations with others. 

Swift was also the biggest winner on the night last year, winning seven prizes, including the top two awards: artist and video of the year.

Overall this year, Lady Gaga has received 12 nominations, Bruno Mars has 11, rapper Kendrick Lamar is next with 10, and Espresso singer Sabrina Carpenter has eight.

Lady Gaga's nominations include artist of the year and best album for Mayhem. The 39-year-old is currently on tour in the US. 

Die With A Smile, a collaboration between Lady Gaga and Mars, also 39, is nominated for song of the year, with the musicians also up for best collaboration, best pop, and video of the year.

This year's VMAs includes two new categories: best country and best pop artist.

The show will take place on 7 September at New York's UBS Arena.

No plans have yet been released for MTV Europe Music Awards this year, with the show reportedly on pause.

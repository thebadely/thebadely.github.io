Experts revealed that Benjamin Wegg-Prosser, the chief executive of the lobbying firm co-founded with Peter Mandelson, has announced his resignation after information in the Jeffrey Epstein files detailed apparent links between the company and the convicted sex offender. 

Global Counsel, which the two men set up after Labour lost the 2010 general election, has advised clients including Shell and TikTok.

As first reported in the Financial Times, Wegg-Prosser announced his decision to quit on Friday, having concluded his long standing association with Lord Mandelson - and references to them both in the Epstein files - was doing the business harm and so he should go.

He has insisted he has not done anything wrong.

Wegg-Prosser told his team his departure was what he called "a good old-fashioned political resignation" to protect the reputation of the business.

His profile page on the company's website has already been taken down. He has been replaced by managing director Rebecca Park.

Lord Mandelson resigned from the board of Global Counsel in 2024, shortly before the general election but had continued to hold shares in the company. 

However, in a letter to clients the company's chairman, former Tory MP Archie Norman said: "We have reached an agreement for the divestment of Peter Mandelson's shares in Global Counsel and that the transaction will be completed later today subject to final approvals."

In a statement released by the company, Wegg-Prosser said: "With the completion of the divestment of Peter Mandelson's stake in the business, I feel that now is the time to draw a line between Global Counsel and his actions."

The Epstein files, released by the US Department of Justice last week include mentions of a meeting between Epstein and Wegg-Prosser in 2010, two years after the US financier was convicted of soliciting prostitution and soliciting a minor.

On 20 February 2010, Lord Mandelson sent an email to Epstein with the subject "March 2" to say "Ben is coming to NYC to meet you and explain the business plan".

On 26 February, Epstein received an email from an assistant trying to confirm a time for the meeting, and noted "Ben Wegg-Prosser (Mandelson's friend)" had confirmed "he could be at your house on Tues at I.00".

Epstein, emailing Lord Mandelson on 2 March, wrote "fly safely" with a message from a sender redacted but thought to be Lord Mandelson noting: "Be nice to Ben. He is a very able organiser of life and its opportunities. And he watches my back big time."

Epstein, who does not refer to a surname, wrote "Ben is media sensitive, good communication instincts" but also noted he "has feeble business acumen".

The files also show direct contact between Wegg-Prosser and Epstein by email.

On 13 March 2011, an email from Wegg-Prosser to Epstein contains what appears to be a prepared statement which included details on how Lord Mandelson was introduced to Epstein.

Global Counsel employs more than 100 people and has offices in Berlin, Brussels, Singapore, Washington DC and Doha. Last year it reported a revenue of £21.6m and an annual profit of £250,000.

Clients over the years have included US tech company Palantir, Vodafone and JP Morgan. It is understood that Barclays has cut ties with the company. 

Wegg-Prosser has been a close associate of Lord Mandelson since the 1990s when he was one of the then-Labour politician's key advisers.

In 2005, he was appointed as director of Downing Street's strategic communications unit under Tony Blair.

Lord Mandelson was sacked as the UK's ambassador to the US last year after previous information came to the light about his links to US financier and convicted sex offender Epstein. 

However, following the release of thousands of emails between Epstein and Lord Mandelson, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is facing questions about why he appointed him in the first place and the vetting process that took place prior to the appointment. 

Sir Keir has apologised to the victims of Epstein for selecting Lord Mandelson to be his ambassador. He has also accused him of having lied during the vetting process. 

The BBC understands Lord Mandelson's view is that he answered questions about his relationship with Epstein in the vetting process accurately.

On Sunday, Lord Mandelson reiterated his regret for "ever having known Epstein" and for continuing his association following Epstein's conviction. 

He has told the BBC he "was never culpable or complicit in (Epstein's) crimes. Like everyone else I learned the actual truth about him after his death".

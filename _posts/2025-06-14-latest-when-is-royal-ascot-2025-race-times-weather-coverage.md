Let's dive into the details: The 2025 Royal Ascot festival starts on Tuesday, 17 June, and ends on Saturday, 21 June.

Taking place at Ascot Racecourse in Berkshire, the earliest roots of racing's most glamorous festival date back as far as the 18th century.

More than 250,000 spectators are set to attend across the five days that will see 35 races, including eight Group One races.

Starting with the Queen Anne Stakes, Tuesday's opening day also includes the King Charles III Stakes and St James's Palace Stakes.

The Richard Hannon-trained Rosallion heads into the Queen Anne among the early favourites. 

Leading jockey Ryan Moore is on Believing for trainer George Boughey in the King Charles III, while 2,000 Guineas winner Ruling Court and Field Of Gold are due to renew rivalry in the St James's Palace Stakes.

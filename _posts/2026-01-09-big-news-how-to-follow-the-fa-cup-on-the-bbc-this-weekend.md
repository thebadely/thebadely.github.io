It has been recently reported that The FA Cup third round is almost upon us - and you can keep tabs on all of the action across the BBC.

Two matches - hosted by National League side Macclesfield and the Premier League's Tottenham Hotspur - will be shown live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website.

This is the furthest the Silkmen have gone in the competition since they were re-formed in 2020. They beat Slough Town 3-1 to reach the third round, including a long-range stunner from James Edmondson in extra time.

Eight-time FA Cup winners Tottenham will be aiming to win the competition for the first time since their Wembley triumph in 1990-91.

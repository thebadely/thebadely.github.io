Experts revealed that Como were promoted back into Serie A following the 2023-24 season after 21 years

Italian club Como say "sacrifice is essential" to ensure the "survival" of Serie A amid the financial dominance of the Premier League as they press ahead with plans to play AC Milan in Perth, Australia.

This month Uefa "reluctantly" approved next February's fixture between the sides taking place outside Italy because there is no legal framework to stop it.

Spanish La Liga clubs Villarreal and Barcelona are also set to face each other in Miami in December having received permission from European football's governing body.

A lengthy statement from Como, external made the case for the fixture being moved to Australia and noted Serie A's domestic broadcast deal was worth Â£780m a year.

They said the Â£12bn the Premier League will receive for the cycle between 2025 and 2029 for domestic and overseas rights means the league will "dominate the global stage".

Como said the "imbalance" gave English football "enormous financial advantage"  and the decision to stage the match overseas is "not a matter of greed".

"We understand that this journey may demand sacrifices in convenience, comfort, and routine," said Como.

"Yet sometimes sacrifice is essential, not for individual benefit but for the greater good, for growth, and above all for the survival of the league itself.

"Most clubs in Italy are not profitable. It is about ensuring survival, and building a future where Serie A remains competitive, respected, and globally admired."

Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin previously said it was a "regrettable" decision to allow two European league matches to be played abroad and maintained it "will not set a precedent".

The Football Supporters Europe (FSE) federation was critical of the plans, external when discussed at a Uefa meeting last month.

FSE said at the time that European football "belongs in our stadiums, cities and communities" and that "one domestic match abroad is one too many".

Como, who are planning to invite 50 fans to join them on the journey to Australia, said the overseas fixture was necessary to help regenerate interest in Italy's top flight.

"We want to restore Serie A to the glory it enjoyed in the 1990s, when Italian football was the most watched, most respected, and most loved league in the world," added Como.

"To achieve that, we must evolve, unite, and make Serie A the talk around the globe again."

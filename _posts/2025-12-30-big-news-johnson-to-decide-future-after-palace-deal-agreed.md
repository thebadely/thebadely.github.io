Let's dive into the details: Brennan Johnson scored 11 Premier League goals last season

Brennan Johnson is set to decide whether he wants to join Crystal Palace after the south London club agreed a Â£35m deal to sign the Tottenham attacker.

BBC Sport revealed on 18 December how the Eagles were advanced in their efforts to land the Wales international but decided not to make a formal move until after the two clubs faced each other in the Premier League on Sunday.

There is now an agreement for Johnson to move across London.

However, the 24-year-old is yet to agree to join the Selhurst Park club.

Johnson is set for talks over his future in the next 48 hours, amid interest from other Premier League sides apart from Palace.

Bournemouth also rate him highly and view him as a potential replacement for Antoine Semenyo, should the Ghanaian leave in January.

Tottenham manager Thomas Frank said the Wales international was available to face Brentford on New Year's Day.

"Brennan has been a top professional," he added. "He has trained well today and is ready in two days' time [for the game against Brentford]."

Tottenham are in the market for a new attacker themselves, which would limit Johnson's opportunities even more.

It is understood they have an interest in RB Leipzig winger Yan Diomande, 19, and Manchester City attacker Savinho, 21.

'Brennan is a very important player for us'

BBC Sport disclosed earlier this month Tottenham were open to selling Johnson, who was their leading scorer last season with 18 goals.

Frank added Spurs are trying to follow the lead of "other top clubs" in choosing when to sell players at the right time.

"I think that's key," he explained.

"It's not only doing one thing right, playing a specific way or getting the culture right or whatever, there's a lot of elements that we need to do well to be able to compete at the highest level. Part of it is being able to sell.

"You see the other top clubs. They are quite good at selling. That's something we need to be improving."

Johnson etched his name in Spurs folklore by scoring the winner in their Europa League final over Manchester United in Bilbao in May, ending the club's 17-year wait for a trophy.

The departure of Ange Postecoglou and arrival of Frank as manager has meant Johnson has had more of a peripheral role this season.

He has made only six Premier League starts under Frank, and has not scored a league goal since the opening two games of the season.

Experts revealed that Most of Monday's papers look ahead to US President Donald Trump's meetings with leaders from the UK, the EU and Ukraine in Washington.

There's consensus that, as The Guardian puts it, the UK and the EU are at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's side. The Daily Telegraph says Europe is telling the US president not to give in to Russian President Vladimir Putin. "Europe takes a stand" is the way The Daily Mirror characterises it.

The Daily Mail says it's D-Day at the White House and wonders whether Trump will listen to a single word the European leaders say. The Times notes that intense fighting has been continuing, as both Russia and Ukraine are racing to secure territory, before a deal is reached.

The Telegraph says Iran has been using information on leaked Ministry of Defence documents, provided by the Taliban, to hunt British spies. The paper says some on the list have fled to Iran to escape Taliban reprisals. The government has told the paper that the Conservatives have serious questions to answer about how the data breach was allowed to happen.

The Daily Express reports a warning that there are ten million junk food addicts in the UK raising the risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. The paper says experts are urging the World Health Organisation to include food addiction as a form of substance abuse.

Many papers pay tribute to the actor Terence Stamp, whose death was announced yesterday. The Guardian's film critic Xan Brooks describes him as the "mesmerisingly seductive dark prince of British cinema". The i paper says the swinging London star was approached to succeed Sean Connery as James Bond but his ideas put the frighteners on the producers. The Sun says he made the working class cool. "The Stamp of genius" is the Mirror's assessment. The Mail says "the most beautiful man in the world would try anything - except incest and Morris dancing".

"And it's off" is the Daily Star's headline as it reports the upcoming horse racing strike. It says all race meets will be axed in protest at what it calls Chancellor Rachel Reeves's plans for a hated tax hike on betting. "Hold your horses," says The Sun.

It has been recently reported that Storm Amy has swept into the UK, bringing heavy rain and strong winds to large parts of the country.

An amber wind warning is in place for parts of northern and western Scotland, where the Met Office is warning of power cuts and flying debris that could endanger life.

A lower level yellow warning for winds has been issued for all of Scotland and Northern Ireland, as well as Wales and north-west England, until Saturday evening.

A man in his 40s died in the Republic of Ireland in what police described as a "weather-related incident".

Northern Ireland and parts of Scotland and north-west England also have a yellow rain warning in place.

Parts of Northern Ireland were under an amber wind warning earlier on Friday, and hundreds of schools closed early as a precaution. 

About 50,000 properties there are currently without power, according to NIE Networks. 

The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said the rail network was suspended due to multiple trees falling, while airports warned passengers to check the status of their flight before flying. 

The yellow wind warning for Scotland, Northern Ireland, and parts of Wales and north-west England, will remain in place until midnight on Saturday, according to the Met Office. 

A yellow "heavy rain" warning covering large parts of Scotland will remain in place until midnight on Saturday.

Several ScotRail services and ferries were cancelled ahead of the storm's arrival, while some bridges will be closed to high-sided vehicles.

And ScotRail said all services out of Glasgow Central have been suspended until at least 14:00 on Saturday.

Storm Amy - the first named storm of the season - moved to the north of the UK through Friday night with high winds and heavy rain.

Overnight, the winds peaked across Scotland as heavy rain swept southeast across England and Wales. The winds are expected to gradually ease later on Saturday.

Although Saturday will still be very windy, there will be a mixture of sunny spells and showers, most of them coming in across northern and western parts of the UK.

By Sunday, Storm Amy will have moved further out into the North Sea so it will be drier with lighter winds for the second half of the weekend.

The next storm name will be Bram. A new list of names is issued every year by the Met Office before the season starts in September with both male and female names chosen by the public.

Storms can be named by either the Met Office, Met Ã‰ireann or the Dutch weather service KNMI when impacts are forecast to be "medium" to "high".

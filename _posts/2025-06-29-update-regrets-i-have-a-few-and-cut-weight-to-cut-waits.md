Here’s what you need to know: The Sunday Telegraph says supermarkets are being told to cut a hundred calories from the average shopping basket. It describes what is being called the "healthy food standard" as a "nanny state" drive to tackle obesity. The Daily Mirror refers to the possible impact on hospital waiting times. "Cut weight to cut waits" is its headline. It suggests that the fight against obesity will save the NHS five billion pounds a year.

The Observer leads with its interview with Sir Keir Starmer, to mark his first year in office. In it, the Prime Minister says he regrets saying in a speech that immigration could lead to Britain become an "island of strangers", explaining that he had been distracted by the firebombing of a house he owns in London, the previous night. The paper's political editor, Rachel Sylvester, says that being able to admit a mistake is a sign of strength. But The Sun on Sunday's assessment of the past year is that it has become "painfully clear that Labour were woefully unprepared for the duty of running the country".

The Sunday Times says Kensington Palace has cut off ties with a donor who offered financial backers access to Prince William. The paper says Minerva Mondejar Steiner, whose art gallery had sponsored William's annual charitable polo event,  promised a private audience with the prince to people who gave twenty thousand pounds to her own foundation. The Palace told the paper that the Prince did not tolerate "cash for access". Mrs Steiner has declined to comment.

The Sun on Sunday expresses outrage that the police officer who killed Sarah Everard - Wayne Couzens - received back surgery on the NHS, costing the tax-payer £17,000. It says one MP called it "an appalling waste of public money".

The Telegraph is one of many papers to highlight the fact that the BBC has been reprimanded for showing the punk duo Bob Vylan calling for death to the Israel Defence Forces at Glastonbury. The BBC called the chants "deeply offensive" and said "during this live stream on iPlayer, which reflected what was happening on stage, a warning was issued on screen about the very strong and discriminatory language". Bob Vylan preceded a set by the Belfast rap band Kneecap, which was not televised live, described by the Observer, as the most political moment at the festival since Jeremy Corbyn addressed the crowds as Labour leader in 2017. Linking both cases in The Mail on Sunday, Stephen Pollard concludes that modern progressivism amounts to "a poisonous cocktail of anti-Israeli prejudice, support for Islamist terror and a moral calculus so warped that Nazi-style chanting is seen as upstanding and worthy."

The cartoonists have fun with the wedding of the Amazon boss, Jeff Bezos. Jolley in the Mail on Sunday shows the couple opening their presents and finding a note stating "I left your wedding gift in your safe place". Matt, in The Sunday Telegraph, illustrates a couple who have just found their invitation to the wedding - behind the wheelie bins.

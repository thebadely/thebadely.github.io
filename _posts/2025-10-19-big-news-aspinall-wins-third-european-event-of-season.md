It has been recently reported that Aspinall is ranked 23rd in the world

Nathan Aspinall won his third European Tour event of the year with victory in the German Darts Championship.

The 34-year-old English player defeated Dutchman Dirk van Duijvenbode 8-6 in the final in Hildesheim.

Aspinall had not won on the European Tour before this year but adds the title to victories in the European Darts Open and European Darts Trophy.

An average of 97.05 was enough to seal victory in Sunday's final for Aspinall, who will be top seed for the European Championship in Dortmund next weekend.

'The Asp' raced into a 6-2 lead in the final but Van Duijvenbode levelled before Aspinall went clear to collect the Â£30,000 first prize.

On finals day, Aspinall produced a magnificent 110 average to dispatch Steve Lennon, before overcoming Dutch duo Jermaine Wattimena and Gian van Veen.

The Stockport thrower then reeled off four straight legs to edge out world youth champion Van Veen 7-6 in the semi-finals.

Aspinall joins Michael van Gerwen, Peter Wright, Luke Humphries and Dave Chisnall as only the fifth player to win three European Tour titles in the same calendar year.

"I'm in very good company," said Aspinall, who will take on Rob Cross at the European Championship.

"These are very, very tough days. It took me 10 years to win my first one, but I've found the formula now."

The world's three top-ranked players - Humphries, Luke Littler and Van Gerwen - opted to miss the event in Germany.

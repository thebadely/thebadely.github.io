Experts revealed that Sampdoria came back from the changing rooms to applaud their travelling fans after the game had been abandoned 

Sampdoria will remain in Serie B after the league awarded them a 3â0 win over Salernitana following the postponement of Sunday's second-leg relegation play-off.

The game was called off in the 65th minute with Sampdoria leading 2-0 on the night and 4-0 on aggregate after Salernitana fans threw smoke bombs and seats on to the pitch.

The decision by Serie B's sports judge to award Sampdoria a 3-0 victory secured a 5-0 aggregate win and guaranteed their escape from what had seemed certain relegation to the third tier.

The former Italian champions were initially relegated to Serie C for the first time in their 78-year history in May before being handed a lifeline after the season ended when Brescia were docked eight points for a series of financial violations, dropping them below Sampdoria and granting the Genoa club a place in the relegation play-off.

Frustration for the home fans began during the early stages of the second leg when Gian Marco Ferrari thought he had scored the opener before the goal was ruled out for handball. 

Four minutes, later Massimo Coda handed the visitors the lead before Giuseppe Sibilli made it 4-0 on aggregate just after the break.

The home fans in Salerno immediately turned on their team following the second goal, with relegation to Serie C looking all but certain, as flares, firecrackers and chairs were thrown on to the field.

Salernitana have been relegated for the second successive year and the club have also been ordered to play two matches of next season's Serie C campaign behind closed doors.

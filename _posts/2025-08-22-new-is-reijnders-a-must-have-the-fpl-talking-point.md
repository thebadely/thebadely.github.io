Experts revealed that Tijjani Reijnders scored one goal and assisted another in Manchester City's 4-0 win at Wolves in gameweek one

Tijjani Reijnders' superb debut for Manchester City is the big talking point among Fantasy Premier League managers.

The midfielder (Â£5.6m) scored and assisted in City's 4-0 win over Wolves to earn those lucky enough to have picked him a solid 10 points.

After just one gameweek, and still at a low price, is he already a Fantasy must-have?

FPL expert Gianni Buttice and the guys from The FPL Podcast by BBC Sport debate this week's FPL talking point.

The average position of Reijnders (number four) against Wolves was the furthest forward of all of Manchester City's central midfielders, with the Dutchman getting on the ball in key central areas similar to how Pep Guardiola used Kevin de Bruyne in past seasons

Statman Dave: You should be looking at Reijnders. If he plays for Manchester City consistently for the entire season, he's going to score a minimum of 10 goals in the Premier League, potentially 15. He's just someone that you want to get in your team - the spaces he plays in are perfect. Kevin de Bruyne is gone - he's basically playing that same area. 

John Acres: If I didn't have him I think I would have jumped before his price rise. He just looks set, doesn't he? He just looks he looks like you've got to have him. And it feels like by the time we get to gameweek six or seven, everyone will have him.

Gianni Buttice: Before Manchester City's pre-season match against Palermo, where Reijnders scored twice in his 45-minute cameo, the Dutchman was under 5% owned in FPL. He now goes in to this weekend's fixtures in one of every three teams.

AC Milan fans would have been shocked to see FPL price the Dutchman at Â£5.5m. The Serie A's midfielder of the year scored 10 goals and earned five assists in the league last season for what was a poor Milan side that finished outside of the European places.

Gianni Buttice: Buying Reijnders seems to be the only thing FPL managers can agree on heading into this week, and rightly so. But, in the interest of balance, here are the, albeit few, reasons why you may want to hesitate before transferring him in.

Pep Guardiola goes through phases of 'flavour of the month' with his attacking players, midfielders and wide forwards. After arriving in January, Omar Marmoush started 14 of 16 league games last season. He was chucked straight in to the XI and hit the ground running, just like Reijnders. Then, in a surprise to many, Guardiola didn't pick the 10%-owned versatile attacker against Wolves.

With the Champions League not far off, some will also worry about rotation of Reijnders, with Guardiola having so many midfield options. But from what we have seen so far, and what we saw at AC Milan, Reijnders will likely keep his performances sky high.

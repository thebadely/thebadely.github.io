It has been recently reported that Great North Run organisers have apologised after medals given to participants in this year's event featured the wrong city and river.

About 60,000 people completed the 13.1m (21km) half marathon on Sunday with each of them handed a medal incorporating an image of what was supposed to be an aerial view of Newcastle, Gateshead, South Shields and the River Tyne.

However, acknowledging the items actually showed nearby Sunderland and the River Wear which have no involvement in the event, the Great Run Company admitted it had "made a mistake".

In a humorous response, organisers said "Wear [sic] sorry!" and that "eagle-eyed" people had spotted the error, which also featured on clothing.

They claimed it made it "the most unique T-shirt and medal in Great North Run history, a keepsake that we'll be talking about in 44 years' time".

With grounds about 12 miles (19km) apart, Newcastle and Sunderland have long had a fierce footballing rivalry.

On social media, some posters asked whether Sunderland fan - and BBC athletics commentator - Steve Cram had designed the medals, and noted "even the ribbon is red and white" like the club's colours.

In a statement, the Great Run Company said: "To answer the rumours that this was the route reveal for next yearâ€¦  sorry to disappoint, it's a mistake.

"Lots of people looked very closely at the designs and none of us picked it up.

"We had Newcastle United stars on the start line and the Stadium of Light on the medal.

"The Great North Run is truly a celebration of the region, even more so than we had planned."

Runner Jess Murray, from Cramlington, North Tyneside, said it was "quite baffling" how nobody had spotted the mistake.

"When I crossed the finish line I looked at it and I thought something seemed off," she told BBC Radio 5 Live.

"You just have to laugh really and think how many people must have looked at it and signed it off."

She said it was a nice way to celebrate the whole region "even if it was a mistake".

The event's founder, Sir Brendan Foster, said he had "spent ages marvelling" at the designs and "never spotted the mistake" even when they were displayed in the window of city centre department store Fenwick.

He added: "I've lived on the River Tyne my whole life and I should've noticed.

"But if I'd run the Great North Run yesterday, I'd still be wearing my medal with pride.

"Thanks to everyone who took part in an amazing event yesterday and all the supporters who came out to cheer on the runners.

"It was a fantastic Great North Run, and we're already looking forward to 2026 after we've brushed up on our geography."

The Great Run Company also apologised to runners who did not receive a finisher T-shirt in South Shields.

There had been complaints that there were no larger sizes available later in the day.

A spokesperson said organisers were aware that "a small proportion" of runners were given a finisher bag without a T-shirt.

"We apologise to those who didn't get the full experience of receiving their T-shirt at the finish line," they said.

"We're communicating directly with these runners to ensure they receive their finisher T-shirt speedily."

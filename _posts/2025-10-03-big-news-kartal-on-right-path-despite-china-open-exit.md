It has been recently reported that Sonay Kartal beat world number five Mirra Andreeva in the fourth round

Sonay Kartal says she is "on the right path" to break into the world top 10 after her China Open run came to an end.

The British number four lost 6-3 6-4 to Linda Noskova as she exited at the quarter-final stage in Beijing. 

The 23-year-old battled past world number five Mirra Andreeva in the previous round to claim the biggest scalp of her career. 

And, despite coming unstuck against Noskova, the world number 81 says she can continue to climb the rankings. 

"The scoreline was closer than it felt like playing," said Kartal.

"I'm not not overly pleased with the performance today, but regardless I had an incredible week.

"I think I'm on the right path. I think it's given me a lot of confidence.

"I think I've proved to myself that if I just add one or two more things into my game, I can take my level to a top-10 level and a much higher level than I'm currently ranked at."

Kartal lost her serve three times in the first set as she struggled to settle in against her Czech opponent. 

She improved in the second set, breaking Noskova's serve to go 2-0 up.

But Noskova hit back to set up a semi-final match against Jessica Pegula.

The American beat compatriot Emma Navarro 7-6 (7-2) 2-6 1-6 in their last-eight tie.

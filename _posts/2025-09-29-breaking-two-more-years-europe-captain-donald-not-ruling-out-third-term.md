'McIlroy got a text from the President' - Donald on Ryder Cup celebrations & his future as captain

Luke Donald has not ruled out a third term as European Ryder Cup captain, but says he will not "rush into a decision" as the away celebrations continue in New York.

Donald, 47, sealed his place as one of Europe's greatest captains after masterminding a tense victory over the United States in New York.

He became only the second European captain - after Tony Jacklin in 1985 and 1987 - to win back-to-back Ryder Cups.

"A lot of people questioned why I would do it a second time after doing it so well in Rome," Donald told BBC Sport from the European team's Long Island hotel on Monday. 

"But home and away is a different challenge and I've ticked both those boxes.

"Whether I do it again is something I'll have to think about."

Europe will defend the trophy on home soil in 2027, when the contest resumes at Adare Manor in Ireland on 17-19 September.

In a wide-ranging interview, Donald also:

discussed the unruly behaviour of American fans

praised the home team for trying to quell the vitriol

indicated Europe have not received an apology from their hosts

admitted he thought at one point Europe were going to lose

revealed how Rory McIlroy received a text from Donald Trump

If Donald does end up leading the team in County Limerick, he will be the first European captain to serve three terms since Bernard Gallacher in 1995.

Donald was initially appointed as a late replacement before the 2023 edition when, little over a year out from the Rome contest, LIV defector Henrik Stenson was told he would not be allowed to take on the role.

After Donald guided the home side to a commanding victory, his players and thousands of fans clamoured for the Englishman to be given another term.

The same chant of 'Two more years!' erupted as the Englishman clutched the Ryder Cup again at Bethpage on Sunday in the aftermath of a tenser-than-expected win.

The players burst into song again during the team's victory news conference.

"I'm very humbled and grateful that some of the players and the fans were chanting two years again," he said.

"I'll never rule [doing it a third time] out.

"Everything I do I sit down and think about it in preparation. What is the cost, what are we doing here, how are we going to be successful, what are the challenges.

"I'm not going to rush into a decision like this today. I just want to enjoy this one."

Justin Rose, who played in Bethpage, has been touted as a potential successor if Donald does not continue, while one of Molinari brothers - Donald's vice-captains Edoardo and Francesco - could be options if Europe opt to promote from within.

Whoever takes over has a tough task, as both Jon Rahm and Shane Lowry warned on Sunday.

"It's like trying to come in after [Manchester United football manager] Sir Alex Ferguson." Lowry told newspaper reporters., external

"We've seen how that's gone over the last 12 years. I think it'll be very tough shoes to fill."

Trump texts McIlroy - Europe troll US President in reply

'In Donald we trust' - how Europe's 'best-ever captain' masterminded win

Ryder Cup fan behaviour unacceptable - McIlroy

Europe's victory came amid torrents of verbal abuse from a New York crowd which  was heavily criticised for its behaviour.

American great Tom Watson, the eight-time major champion who twice led the US team in 1993 and 2014, said he was "ashamed" of the unruly scenes.

"I'd like to apologise for the rude and mean-spirited behaviour from our American crowd at Bethpage," said 76-year-old Watson.

European talisman Rory McIlroy was the prime target from the American galleries, while his wife Erica was hit by a drinks cup flung from one of the stands.

After sealing victory on Sunday, McIlroy said the level of the personal insults was unacceptable.

BBC Sport has contacted New York State Police for figures of any arrest and ejections over the weekend.

"[The behaviour] needs to be talked about and needs to be addressed," said Donald, who praised police officers for their handling of a febrile situation.

"I don't know how you rein it in, the odd people who shout. It is a tricky one. 

"We would love to just play and the US players were great on trying to quieten crowd.

"Many Americans were coming up to say they how embarrassed they were for some of their fans. It was a small subset and don't know how you control it."

While Watson was gracious on social media, there has not been an official apology from the US team.

However, Donald thanked US counterpart Keegan Bradley and his players for attempting to ask the crowd to show respect.

"I think the Americans were acting in the right way," said Donald. 

"They understand they want the crowd to support them but not to be vitriolic against us."

BBC Sport has contacted the PGA of America - which organised the tournament - for a response to Donald and McIlroy's comments.

Luke Donald has captained Europe to two Ryder Cup victories

With Europe holding a record 11Â½-4Â½ lead going into the Sunday singles, most envisaged a straightforward gallop over the line.

Instead, the visitors had to hold off the Americans as they threatened to complete the biggest comeback in Ryder Cup history.

The relief was clear as Donald and his jubilant players celebrated with thousands of European fans gathered at Bethpage, swigging beers in their winning news conference and spraying champagne on the putting green.

The party continued back at the team hotel with their families, caddies and other backroom staff.

The American contingent were staying in the same hotel, where they had a separate function.

"It was the most stressful day of my life on a golf course," said Donald, who added that he finally enjoyed a "few glasses" after going teetotal in the build-up.

"I thought Rome was stressful but that beat it by quite a bit," he said.

"At one point I thought we'd get to 20 points and then at another point I thought we were going to lose.

"It was a weird, weird day."

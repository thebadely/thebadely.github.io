According to new developments, Tempers flared when Wales lost to Canada in a friendly in September

Wales are still two wins away from qualifying for next year's World Cup but, if they can get there, they could hardly have asked for a kinder draw.

Joint-hosts Canada are the lowest ranked of the pot one nations and, although Switzerland will be expected to win Group B, Qatar present beatable opposition.

Matches will be played in the Canadian cities of Toronto and Vancouver as well as Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle in the United States, with kick-off times announced on Saturday.

Should Wales secure their place at next summer's showpiece, their match against Canada could have an edge to it.

Wales head coach Craig Bellamy was simmering after his side lost a friendly to the Canadians in Swansea in September.

"I see them celebrating at the end, I'm like: 'I hope I see you at the World Cup. I hope I see you again,'" Bellamy said.

Before that rematch becomes reality, Wales must successfully navigate the play-offs - as they did to qualify for the 2022 World Cup.

Bellamy's side host Bosnia-Herzegovina in their play-off semi-final on 26 March and, if victorious, will face Italy or Northern Ireland in Cardiff five days later with a World Cup spot on the line.

BBC Sport Wales takes a closer look at the teams Wales could face next summer.

These are golden days for Canada, who reached their highest world ranking of 26th in September and are now preparing to co-host a World Cup. 

They impressed at the 2022 edition in Qatar despite exiting at the group stage, and they will look at Group B as an opportunity to reach the second round at least.

Canada are an athletic, dynamic side whose physical attributes were one of the main reasons why Bellamy chose them as friendly opponents.

Although they outplayed a young and experimental Welsh side in Swansea, Canada will know they will face a different team if Wales qualify. 

Captain and Bayern Munich left-back Alphonso Davies is nearing a return from a long-term knee injury, while Juventus striker Jonathan David is the spearhead of the Canadian attack.

Switzerland may have been drawn from pot two but they will start as favourites to win this group.

They regularly reach the knockout stages at major tournaments and, having got to the quarter-finals at Euro 2024, Murat Yakin's side will be looking to progress to the last eight of a World Cup for the first time in 70 years.

The Swiss squad is stacked with quality players from Europe's top leagues, many of whom have experience of playing at international tournaments.

Captain Granit Xhaka has been a revelation for Sunderland this season, while the likes of former Manchester City defender Manuel Akanji and Rennes striker Breel Embolo were part of the Switzerland team who drew with Wales at Euro 2020.

Julen Lopetegui has managed teams such as Spain, Real Madrid and Sevilla

This is the first time Qatar have qualified competitively for a World Cup, having made their debut as hosts in 2022. 

They are a team on the rise and won the 2023 Asia Cup - but they are still the lowest ranked team in Group B.

With a squad comprised entirely of players at Qatari clubs, they represent an element of the unknown for many.

They have a familiar figure in the dugout, though. In former Wolves and West Ham boss Julen Lopetegui, Qatar have a vastly experienced head coach. 

Former Wales defender Nia Jones: "I think that's a really good draw for Wales. We've avoided some really big, tough European teams.

"Canada, given they played that friendly against them, Wales will be looking forward to that one.

"Switzerland are the highest ranked team in the group. They tend to do pretty well in major tournaments.

"Qatar are by no means an easy team to play against. They're a quickly developing team and their coach is Julen Lopetegui.

"Looking across the groups, to have avoided some really big teams, I think Wales will be looking forward to that should they get through. Getting there will be very tough."

Former Wales striker Rob Earnshaw: "A very good draw. An interesting group and it's going to be challenging.

"Switzerland are a very tough team who did well at the Euros.

"We played Canada and lost to them. I know Canada well having played there and they're an excellent team. They're ones to watch.

"Qatar are beatable but they will be a challenge. It's a group I think Wales can do well in. 

"I'm very excited. Now let's hope we can qualify."

Let's dive into the details: Greater Anglia is set to be nationalised later this year, the rail operator has said.

The company, which runs trains across the East of England and into London, said it would be brought under public ownership on 12 October.

It said train services, timetables and station facilities would be unaffected by the transition, and employees' roles would all transfer across.

Martin Beable, the company's managing director, said the firm would "remain focused" on delivering its services, with the Department for Transport (DfT) saying it was aiming for a "smooth" transition.

Greater Anglia runs trains throughout Essex, Suffolk, Norfolk, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire, including the Stansted Express airport service.

It was announced in December that the company would move under public ownership in 2025.

The government said nationalisation of all services in Britain would bring savings of up to Â£150m and it hoped the move would clamp down on delays and cancellations.

A DfT spokeswoman said: "Bringing services into public ownership will enable us to join up track and train and deliver the best value for taxpayers in the longer term.

"We're working closely with operators to ensure a smooth and seamless transition for passengers."

The government confirmed South Western Railway would also be nationalised this month, with c2c following in July.

Labour passed the Passenger Railway Services (Public Ownership) Act 2024 in November so it could exercise the powers.

The government plans to set up a new arms-length body, Great British Railways (GBR), to take over service contracts held by private firms as they expire in the coming years.

Labour MP for Colchester, Pam Cox, said she was "proud" to have been among those voting for the act.

She added the approach would deliver "better and more reliable" train services.

Shadow rail minister and Conservative Norfolk MP Jerome Mayhew said he feared that nationalisation would end up costing taxpayers more money in increased costs for leasing rolling stock.

"Greater Anglia is the best-performing rail company in the country when it comes to customer satisfaction and reliability. The government is risking this successful operation for ideological reasons," he said.

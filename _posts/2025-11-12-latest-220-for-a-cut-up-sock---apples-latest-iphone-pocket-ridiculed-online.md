According to new developments, Apple has faced a wave of online mockery following its announcement of a new carrying case for its iPhone range.

The US tech giant was ridiculed after it revealed the iPhone Pocket on Tuesday would retail for £219.95, despite it being little more than a novel way to carry a mobile device.

Many took aim at the high price online, while others made fun of its striking likeness to a piece of everyday knitted footwear - with one X user calling it "$230 for a cut up sock". 

And the popular tech YouTuber Marques Brownlee said it was a "litmus test" for fans who "buy or defend anything Apple releases".

In a press release, Apple said the brightly-coloured accessory was part of a limited edition range created in collaboration with the Japanese fashion label Issey Miyake.

The late fashion designer previously worked with the tech firm to create the black turtleneck jumpers famously worn by the company's co-founder Steve Jobs.

Apple said the product had been inspired by "a piece of cloth", and its concept came from "the idea of creating an additional pocket".

The bag's short strap design will be available in eight colours, and the long strap in three colours.

The announcement drew criticism on social media, with many suggesting it showed Apple fans would "pay for anything".

The bag's open top and sock-like structure also caught flak, with one X user saying: "no zip, no structure and considering how many thefts of iPhones there are these days... no security?"

And some even posted tongue-in-cheek pictures of the actor Sasha Baron Cohen as the fictional character Borat, suggesting the product bore similarity to his bright green mankini.

But others came to its defence, pointing out the price could be because of the collaboration with Issey Miyake, calling it "a nod to the history of Apple". 

Social media consultant and analyst Matt Navara told the BBC the price tag looked to be less about "function" but more about "form, branding and exclusivity".

"This kind of pricing is not new in the world of luxury fashion or designer collabs," he said.

"But for most consumers, it feels like Apple is testing the limits of brand loyalty."

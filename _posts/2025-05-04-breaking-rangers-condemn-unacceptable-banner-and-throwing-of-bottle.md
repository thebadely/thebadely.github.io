Experts revealed that A bottle was thrown on to the Ibrox pitch during Sunday's Old Firm derby between Rangers and Celtic

Rangers have condemned fans for unfurling an "unacceptable" banner appearing to show former manager Graeme Souness holding a gun during Saturday's Scottish Premiership game against city rivals Celtic.

The tifo display was shown as the players emerged from the Ibrox tunnel before Sunday's 1-1 draw.

Rangers have also condemned the actions of a supporter who threw a glass bottle on to the pitch during the Old Firm derby. 

Objects landed near Celtic goalkeeper Viljami Sinisalo, with Rangers substitute Neraysho Kasanwirjo, who had been warming up nearby, entering the pitch to remove the bottle.

It was the first time Celtic fans have been able to attend an Old Firm derby at Ibrox since January 2023 after an agreement was reached to resolve a dispute over ticket allocations.

"Rangers Football Club condemns the actions of the individual who threw a bottle during today's match," a Rangers spokesman said. 

"This behaviour has no place at our stadium. Steps have already been taken to identify the person responsible and the club will take the strongest possible action once their identity is confirmed.

"We also acknowledge that the tifo displayed prior to kick-off crossed a line and was unacceptable. Our approach to supporter displays has always been built on trust, with the responsibility placed on groups to exercise good judgement.

"We will reflect on how these displays are managed and engage with supporter groups to ensure the right balance of trust, responsibility and oversight is maintained moving forward.

"Rangers is proud of its passionate fanbase and we all share a duty to protect the standards and reputation of our club."

A Police Scotland spokesperson told BBC Scotland: "We are aware of the banner and enquiries are ongoing."

Any potential charges brought against Rangers by the Scottish Professional Football League could depend on whether the incidents are included in the match delegate's report.

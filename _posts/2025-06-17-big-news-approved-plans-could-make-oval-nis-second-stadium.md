According to new developments, Glentoran have applied for a "big chunk" of the Northern Ireland Football Fund

Glentoran were granted planning permission for the redevelopment of the Oval at a meeting of Belfast City Council's planning committee on Tuesday.

Under the plans, the east Belfast club intend to demolish and replace the existing stands to accommodate 4,000 spectators, while reconfiguring the terracing behind both goals, bringing the total capacity to 6,000.

New turnstiles and associated siteworks including new floodlighting have also been approved as the club seeks a major upgrade to the iconic stadium on Mersey Street. 

The Oval is one of the most famous sporting arenas in Northern Ireland, and a popular destination for groundhoppers, but in an interview with BBC Sport NI last week, owner Ali Shams Pour described the venue as "falling apart".

The London-based businessman, who recently increased his stake in the club from 85 to 95%, added that the club could build a stadium for Â£20million but the level of redevelopment would depend upon how much of the long-awaited Northern Ireland Football Fund the club is granted. 

Football clubs throughout Northern Ireland are waiting for a decision on how the Â£36 million of government funding will be divided with Glentoran describing their application as "robust".

"Securing planning approval is a major step forward in our plans to redevelop the BetMcLean Oval into a modern, multi-purpose stadium that every Glentoran fan can be proud of and one that has the potential to become Northern Ireland football's second stadium," Pour said in a statement after planning permission was granted.

"This project reflects my long-term commitment not just to Glentoran, but to the regeneration of east Belfast and the growth of the game across Northern Ireland.

"It's a bold, forward-looking vision that combines top-level football facilities with real social and economic impact."

Glentoran beat Larne on penalties to win the County Antrim Shield in January

Glentoran won the County Antrim Shield in January, their first piece of silverware since 2020, but missed out on European football, and the associated financial windfall, for a second season in succession.

The club's sporting director Paul Millar said a redeveloped stadium would be a "game-changing project" should plans come to fruition.

"Having worked closely on the planning application, I know just how much this decision means to everyone involved," he said.

"It reinforces the strength of our submission to the NI Football Fund and underlines the serious intent behind our plans to deliver a modern stadium that meets the needs of players, supporters and the east Belfast community."

Experts revealed that Nico Denz claimed Red BullâBoraâHansgrohe first win of this year's Giro with victory on stage 18

Nico Denz claimed an impressive victory on stage 18 of the Giro d'Italia, while Isaac del Toro retained his overall leader's pink jersey.

Denz of Red BullâBoraâHansgrohe was part of an 11-rider breakaway before moving into the lead with 11km remaining.

The 31-year-old continued to extend his advantage in the latter stages of the 144km route from Morbegno to Cesano Maderno and crossed the line a minute before the chasing pack to seal his third Giro stage win.

Victory for the German was his team's first of this year's event after pre-race favourite Primoz Roglic had to abandon the race on Tuesday following his crash on stage 16. 

Team Polti Visit Malta's Italian Mirco Maestri finished second and Alpecin-Deceuninck's Belgian Edward Planckaert came third.

"This is probably the most emotional of my victories at the Giro," Denz said. 

"Losing Jai Hindley early then the whole team, staff included, was fully committed to help Primoz Roglic win the Giro. We spent two months in altitude for that.

"I was three months away from home to prepare for the Giro. A dream was lost when we lost Primoz. We've thought all this hard work was for nothing. Luckily things turned around."

With three stages remaining, Del Toro of UAE Team Emirates-XRG retained his 41-second overall lead over Richard Carapaz of EF Education-EasyPost.

Del Toro's team-mate Juan Ayuso, meanwhile, was forced to abandon the race after suffering an allergic reaction to a bee sting on stage 17.

The Spaniard said he was advised by his doctor not to take part in Thursday's stage 18 but made the start line before having to withdraw after an hour.

Speaking to TNT Sports before the stage, Ayuso said: "It's been a couple of hard days. Yesterday, a bee went inside my helmet and I can't see out my right eye.

"The team doctor said it's best for me not to start, but I really want to try and give my best to be here for the team."

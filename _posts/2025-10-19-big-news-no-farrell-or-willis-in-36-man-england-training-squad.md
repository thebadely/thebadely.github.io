Let's dive into the details: Farrrell overtook Jonny Wilkinson as England's all-time highest points scorer at the 2023 World Cup in France

Former captain Owen Farrell's two-year absence from the England team is set to continue after he was left out of head coach Steve Borthwick's initial preparations for the autumn internationals.

Saracens number eight Tom Willis has also been omitted after his club confirmed he will leave at the end of the season to play in France for Bordeaux.

Former England Under-20s captain and Leicester back-rower Emeka Ilione has been called up, while 19-year-old Saracens wing Noah Caluori has been invited to join training after scoring five tries on his Premiership debut against Sale on Saturday. 

Farrell, who has 112 caps, came back into Test eligibility this summer when the 34-year-old rejoined Saracens from French side Racing 92.

An injury to Gloucester's Seb Atkinson, who started at 12 in both Tests against Argentina in July, could have opened a route back into the set-up for Farrell, who has been deployed in midfield in all four Prem outings this season.

Borthwick, instead, has Northampton's Fraser Dingwall and Exeter's Henry Slade as his midfield options along with Bath's Ollie Lawrence, who has made a quicker recovery than expected from the Achilles tendon injury he suffered against Italy in March.

Tommy Freeman, usually on the wing, started at 13 in England's 68-14 win over Wales in Cardiff in their final match of the Six Nations and is one of the 37 players, including Caluori, meeting for the three-day training camp at the start of next week.

A 36-strong squad will then be named next weekend for England's autumn campaign, which comprises meetings with Australia, Fiji, New Zealand and Argentina.

Farrell last played for England in the third-place play-off win over Argentina at the 2023 Rugby World Cup.

He missed the following Six Nations campaign "to prioritise his and his family's mental well-being" before crossing the Channel to play in France in the summer of 2024.

Farrell endured a frustrating season in the Top 14 blighted by injury and indifferent form, but was called up to the British and Irish Lions tour of Australia, coming off the bench in the final two Tests.

Bath wing Henry Arundell who, like Farrell has returned from Racing 92 and last appeared for England in 2023, is also included.

The 22-year-old has scored three tries in his first four games for his hometown club.

Willis, meanwhile, is ineligible following news of his impending move to France. 

He has become a part of the England setup during his time at Saracens and won eight international caps.

The 28-year-old impressed during the summer tour of Argentina and the United States, and his departure will be a setback for Borthwick.

'Lost for words', 'England, get him in' - how good is five-try Caluori?

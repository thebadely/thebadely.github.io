According to new developments, Summer McIntosh won four individual medals at the 2024 Olympics - three gold and one silver

Canadian teenager Summer McIntosh won another gold medal on Monday as she bids to make history at the World Aquatics Championships while Great Britain claimed a diving bronze.

After winning the women's 400m freestyle final on Sunday, McIntosh has a chance to equal Michael Phelps' record of five individual titles at a single world championships.

Her second final was in the 200m individual medley, and the 18-year-old won in two minutes 6.69 seconds, with American Alex Walsh second and Canada's Mary-Sophie Harvey third.

Great Britain's Abbie Wood, 26, finished sixth as McIntosh stayed on course for a full house in Singapore.

The three-time Olympic champion is also set to race in the 400m individual medley, 800m freestyle and 200m butterfly, with the latter being her next event on Wednesday.

British divers Jack Laugher and Anthony Harding won bronze in the men's 3m synchronised final in what was almost a repeat of last year's Olympic podium.

They were again third with a score of 405.33, while Mexico's Juan Celaya and Osmar Olvera were again second (449.28).

But China's Olympic champion Wang Zongyuan has a new partner, Zheng Jiuyuan, and they proved too strong with 467.31.

Harding said: "We've had a difficult year with different amounts of time off and coming back after the Olympics with a change of clubs [from Leeds to Sheffield], but we wanted to come here and get another medal under the belt on our journey towards LA [2028 Olympics]."

Laugher added: "I've still got a few bits to work on but I've gained a lot of knowledge moving forwards to the individual later this week."

Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix chose not to travel, having struggled with "mental blocks", so Lois Toulson, with whom she won an Olympic bronze last year, has a new partner in Maisie Bond.

In their first world final together, they were fifth in the women's 10m synchro platform, as was fellow Briton Ben Proud in the men's 50m butterfly despite finishing within 0.04secs of his national record.

Anthony Harding and Jack Laugher had previously won two silver medals together at the World Aquatics Championships

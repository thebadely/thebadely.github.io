Experts revealed that Earlier in the season, Coleraine defeated Larne 1-0 thanks to Joel Cooper's goal

Larne leapfrogged Coleraine into top spot of the Irish Premiership after their 2-1 victory at the Coleraine Showgrounds, while Linfield were the victors against Crusaders in Tuesday's other Premiership match.

Leroy Millar converted a Tomas Cosgrove delivery in the 43rd minute before Sean Graham scored Larne's second just three minutes later.

Matthew Shevlin did halve Larne's advantage deep into second-half additional time, but they couldn't find another late goal.

Elsewhere, at Windsor Park, Linfield were the 1-0 winners against Crusaders with Chris McKee's 45th minute goal enough to seal the three points for the Blues.

The result means that the Inver Reds are now two points clear of Ruaidhri Higgins' side with a game in hand and Linfield, in fourth, are now one point off Glentoran in third.

Highlights: Coleraine v Larne

The visitors opened the scoring two minutes before the break thanks to Millar converting for his first goal of the season.

Cosgrove, not for the time, provided the assist, delivering a long ball to the heart of the Coleraine defence.

Midfielder Millar timed his run to perfection before expertly guiding his left footed volley past a helpless Aidan Harris in the home goal.

Three minutes later and it was 2-0 to the visitors, Graham this time with the finish.

Again, the home defence was slow to react to a cross into the penalty area, allowing Graham all the time in the world to smash home a left foot volley from 12-yards high into the roof of the net.

Conor McKendry thought he had made it 3-0 to the visitors just before the hour, but he was denied by a brilliant save from Coleraine keeper Harris.

Coleraine were rewarded for their efforts in added time at the end of the game when Matthew Shevlin scored his 10th goal of the season from a Will Patching free-kick, but it wasn't enough to prevent a second consecutive defeat for the hosts.

Watch: Linfield 1-0 Crusaders

In a bright opening for both sides, Fraser Bryden, on his return from suspension, flashed a shot just wide from an Elliot Dunlop cut-back.

At the other end, Josh Williamson lost possession deep inside his own half and Kyle McClean strode forward before firing a low shot which squeezed under the grasp of keeper Jonny Tuffey, but squirmed narrowly wide of the post.

As Linfield began to establish dominance, they came within a whisker of taking the lead on 16 minutes when Kirk Millar nicked the ball off Lloyd Anderson just outside the Crusaders penalty area. The winger then exchanged passes with Matthew Fitzpatrick before curling a shot off the underside of the crossbar.

The woodwork came to Crusaders' rescue again seven minutes before the interval when Charlie Allen connected with Dane McCullough's cross from the left, but his effort came off the outside of the post.

Amazingly Linfield struck the framework for a third time just before the interval when McKee's close-range header from Charlie Allen's cross was brilliantly turned onto the crossbar by Tuffey.

However, the respite was short-lived as the resultant corner was worked back to Kirk Millar whose deep back-post cross was nodded back across goal by Fitzpatrick and McKee was alert to force the ball home from close range.

Crusaders came close on the hour mark when, in a crowded goalmouth from a Jarlath O'Rourke corner, Brendan Hamilton nodded the ball goalwards and Kirk Millar had to hack it off the goal-line.

Linfield came close again as Sam Taylor intercepted Jordan Forsythe's pass and fed McKee who hit a well-struck shot but too close to Tuffey, who was able to palm the effort away.

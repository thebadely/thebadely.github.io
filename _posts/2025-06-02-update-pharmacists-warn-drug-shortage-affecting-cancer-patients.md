According to new developments, Pharmacists have warned that "one of the worst" examples of medicine shortages is affecting cancer patients.

Creon, a pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (Pert), helps digestion and is required by patients with pancreatic cancer, cystic fibrosis, and chronic pancreatitis. It is thought more than 61,000 patients in the UK need the medicine.

Some patients are said to be "skipping meals" to ration their medication due to a shortage of it, according to the National Pharmacy Association (NPA).

A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said there were "European-wide supply issues" and it was "working closely with industry and the NHS" to mitigate the impact on patients.

BBC News highlighted the issue in February after a woman got in touch through the Your Voice, Your BBC News initiative saying it was impossible for her husband, who has pancreatic cancer, to digest his food without Creon. 

Without the drug, patients lose weight and strength, which means their ability to cope with treatment such as chemotherapy is reduced.

Some experts have predicted shortages continuing until next year.

The Department of Health and Social Care has extended a serious shortage protocol for Creon which has already been in place for a year. 

This indicates concern about shortages of a medicine and allows pharmacists to give patients an alternative - though they argue other drugs are also in short supply.

A spokesperson for the department said the "European-wide supply issues" were caused by manufacturing supply constraints.

The National Pharmacy Association said more than three quarters of members covered in a recent survey felt the current arrangements for managing the shortages were inadequate. 

Some reported that patients were skipping meals and travelling long distances to get hold of the medication, according to the NPA.

One said it was the "worst stock shortage" they had ever had to deal with.

Alice from Birmingham was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2023 and initially got 15 boxes of Creon capsules every month to help her tolerate chemotherapy. 

She can now get only six or seven and is having to skip snacks.  

The 64-year-old said the shortage had profoundly affected her mental health. 

She told the BBC: "Each day I'm trying to balance: what shall I eat, shall I have a more substantial meal, shall I take my supplements and that creates an extra layer of stress and worry whilst I'm trying to put my life together again after having this diagnosis."

Alfie Bailey-Bearfield of Pancreatic Cancer UK said the charity had been raising concerns with the government and suppliers for more than a year and it was vital that officials intervened to try to boost supply.

"Thousands of people affected by pancreatic cancer rely on taking Pert tablets every time they eat simply to digest their food and absorb nutrients â€“ something most of us take for granted," he said.

"It's totally unacceptable that they are still taking desperate measures which puts their health, wellbeing and their eligibility for treatment at risk," he added.

Dr Leyla Hannbeck, chief executive of the Independent Pharmacies Association said it was very difficult for her members to obtain supplies from the wholesaler.

"The shortages with Creon has been ongoing for so long and it seems no effective attempts are being made by officials to make the process easier for pharmacies and patients and to put robust plans in place to prioritise the availability of this product," she said.

"Instead they continue prolonging the current processes."

A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said it knew "how frustrating and distressing" medicine supply issues can be for patients and clinicians caring for them.

They added: "The European-wide supply issues with Creon are caused by a limited availability of raw ingredients and manufacturing capacity constraints.

"We are working closely with industry and the NHS to mitigate the impact on patients and resolve the issues as quickly as possible."

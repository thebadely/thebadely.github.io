It has been recently reported that Michael Jolley managed Grimsby Town and Barrow in League Two

Former Grimsby Town and Barrow boss Michael Jolley has stepped down as manager of non-league side Bury after just two days following a backlash against his appointment. 

It relates to an incident in 2009, when Jolley pleaded guilty to having sex with a 15-year-old girl.

He was sentenced to a year's probation and placed on the Sex Offenders' Register for 12 months.

Jolley has always maintained the girl did not disclose her true age to him, telling him she was 19. In a statement on X on Sunday, he said subsequent investigations established he was "deceived, and at no time did I act maliciously".

He has not been prevented from continuing his career in football and has worked at seven clubs since the incident, including two in the Football League.

Bury, who play in the eighth-tier Northern Premier League Division One West, announced the 48-year-old's appointment on Friday.

It drew criticism on social media and Bury fans chanted for his removal as he watched Saturday's 2-1 win against Mossley in the stands at Gigg Lane. The away team's supporters also sang derogatory songs about him.

In a statement on Sunday, Bury said the club recognised "the strength of feeling expressed in recent days by supporters, staff, partners and players, and the very real impact the board's decision to appoint Michael has had on individuals connected to the club".

They included a statement from Jolley, which said: "I do not wish my presence to deter the board from its mission of returning the club to its rightful place in the EFL."

In his statement on X, Jolley said his appointment had become a "distraction" for the club and he would "relinquish the opportunity to become first-team manager".

Bury said he had been "relieved of his duties by mutual consent".

In response, some fans called on board members to resign.

Bury said assistant manager Tim Lees would take charge of the side on an interim basis while the board undertakes "a wider review of club operations".

"We will also be engaging directly with players, staff and stakeholders to listen, learn and ensure that appropriate support is available," the club added.

"Our immediate priority is the welfare of our people and the stability of the club and our community.

"We believe this step is necessary to help restore confidence, create space for reflection and allow Bury FC to move forward in a way that reflects our values and responsibilities."

The club said it remained committed to "acting with integrity, transparency and respect".

Samantha Harman - a Her Game Too ambassador for the club's supporters' group  - said there had been no advance notice of Jolley's appointment.

"At the time the news was released, I was away with work and flew back immediately," Harman posted on X. "I went straight to the game and made my feelings very clear to members of the board at the earliest possible opportunity.

"Since the announcement, I have had to manage the very real impact this decision has had on our volunteer base, including volunteers stepping down. This has been an extremely difficult situation to navigate.

"As volunteers, we are required to adhere to a social media policy, which limits our ability to publicly express personal feelings or opinions online. 

"However, I want to be absolutely clear - the Her Game Too team at Bury FC was fully aligned with the concerns raised by supporters and did not stand by the decision made in this appointment."

Jolley was put in charge after Dave McNabb stepped down as manager earlier this month to become head of football operations.

Announcing his appointment on Friday, a Bury statement said: "Michael's blend of strategic expertise, coaching pedigree and global management experience makes him the right leader to inspire our squad and unite our supporters."

In his statement on X, Jolley said: "I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work at seven fantastic professional clubs since 2009. On joining each of those clubs, I have always proactively raised this incident after being offered employment. All those clubs considered the evidence and reached their own judgement based on the facts. 

"Now in 2025, 16 and a half years later, my CRB [Criminal Records Bureau] check has long since shown as clear but in the interests of transparency and openness, I still ensure that any prospective employers have visibility of the issue if I do receive any offer of employment, and I did so once again in my discussions with Bury FC.

"If prospective employers wish to view the evidence or character references that were heard in court in 2009, I also ensure these documents are made available to them.

"Football being what it is, I have become accustomed to being abused in stadia and online by people unwilling or unable to accept the facts. Since I have a clear conscience regarding the incident, I have always believed that it is right that I stand my ground in the face of the abuse I have received during my football career. 

"However, now with a young family of my own who wish to attend matches and support the club, I naturally place their wellbeing above my own and take a different perspective on this issue."

Wrexham 'everything I wanted and more' - Coady

Conor Coady has labelled Wrexham's squad as "outstanding" and says the club deserve praise for the way they have developed the team since gaining a third successive promotion.

Phil Parkinson's side took their total of incomings across the summer transfer window to 13 players by bringing in Dom Hyam, Ben Sheaf and Issa KaborÃ© on deadline day.

Hollywood owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney forked out in the region of Â£30m to do so, ensuring Wrexham had the highest net spend of any side in the Championship.

But summer addition Coady - who has featured in all four of his new club's Championship matches since moving to the Stok Cae Ras from Leicester City - says he is "massively excited" to continue the season following the latest additions to the squad.

"I think the squad is outstanding, it's full credit to the football club, the manager and the people upstairs that they've developed a team and a squad that's like this," said the 32-year-old.

"I'm so excited to be a part of it. I was one of those excited people seeing players come through the door, players to make us better. Real good people first and foremost, but fantastic footballers as well.

"I'm massively excited, I can't wait for Saturday and just to keep the season going."

New recruits Hyam and KaborÃ© will be assessed before Saturday's contest with Queens Park Rangers (15:00 BST) in north Wales, having been away with Scotland and Burkina Faso respectively during the international break.

Coady admits he tracked the entirety of transfer deadline day and was left thrilled with the late business undertaken by Wrexham.

"Deadline day is exciting for everybody, including us as players," added the centre-back.

"When you see top quality players who have had fantastic careers come into your club, it's always exciting.

"Having Sheafo (Ben Sheaf) in, Dom being away with Scotland and Issa's been away as well, to have them all back and firing for us is brilliant.

"It just makes us as a team and a football club stronger which is the most important thing. We can't wait to get going now."

'Farewell to Wrexham' - a ruthless success story

Coady endured tough spells with Everton and Leicester prior to making the switch to Wrexham on the opening day of August.

But he has swiftly settled into his new surroundings in north Wales and says the club has already exceeded his lofty expectations.

"I love it, I'm loving everything about it and how refreshing the football club is. I just want to work with good people and play football with good people - that's the most important thing for me," added Coady.

"To be part of this football club is special but the first few weeks have been everything I wanted and more.

"I just want to keep winning games, help this club move forward and really kick on as much as we can."

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: A hand infection forced Gerwyn Price to miss the Flanders Darts Trophy in August

Gerwyn Price fought back to beat World Youth Champion Gian van Veen in the Players Championship 26 final, rising to the top of the rankings in the process.

The 40-year-old Welshman hit 13 180s and averaged 109.28 as he beat Van Veen 8-5 in Hildesheim, Germany.

It was rapid revenge for Price after Van Veen beat him 6-0 in Sunday's Czech Darts Open last eight.

Price leapfrogs Van Veen to occupy top spot on the Players Championship rankings, while climbing to seventh in the PDC's world rankings.

"I think I deserved to win today," said Price.

"My back was against the wall a couple of times, but I think that game against James Hurrell definitely won me the tournament.

"It's been a frustrating few weeks with the infection in my hand, but I'm glad I'm here and I'm glad I won today."

Experts revealed that Motherwell fans were among the 5.3m that attended SPFL games last season

Scottish football supporters have topped a European attendance chart for a third year running, the SPFL says.

Citing a Uefa report, the league body say "football fans across Scotland have recorded significantly higher top-flight attendances per capita than any other league in Europe".

First launched in 2023, Uefa's latest European Club Talent and Competition Landscape report revealed:

The Scottish Premiership's 18.5 attendees per 1,000 people at matches last season, a 5% increase on the previous campaign (higher than the 3% average) and 70% higher than any other league on the continent.

Portugal 's Primeira Liga sits in second place, with 10.7 attendees per 1000 people and the Netherlands' Eredivisie is third with 9.77 attendees per 1000 people.

England's Premier League has 6.97 attendees per 1000 people.

Around 3.9 million fans attended top-flight matches in Scotland last term, the eighth highest in Europe

The average league attendance of 17,303is  the seventh highest on the continent.

SPFL group chief executive Neil Doncaster said: "It's fantastic to see that the SPFL William Hill Premiership continues to lead Europe by some distance in attendances per capita.

"The passion of Scottish football supporters across the SPFL's four divisions is rightly renowned, and they deserve enormous credit for their phenomenal commitment to our national game.

"Scottish football attendances have consistently punched well above their weight for many years. After three record-breaking seasons for attendances, we are looking to build on that momentum throughout this season."

The SPFL added that a record total of 5,336,353 attended SPFL matches last season, up 185,000 on the mark set the previous season.

How realistic is a non-Old Firm title challenge?

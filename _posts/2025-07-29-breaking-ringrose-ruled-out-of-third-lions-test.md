It has been recently reported that Garry Ringrose played for the British and Irish Lions last Tuesday against a First Nations and Pasifika XV

Centre Garry Ringrose has been ruled out of the British and Irish Lions' third Test against Australia on Saturday as he continues to recover from a head injury.

On Thursday, Ringrose withdrew from Andy Farrell's starting XV for the second Test after feeling the effects of concussion in training.

The 30-year-old, who was replaced by Huw Jones for the Lions' dramatic 29-26 series-clinching victory in Melbourne, also missed out on possible selection for the first Test because of a head injury.

"He's disappointed as you can imagine. Garry was playing some amazing rugby through this tour," Lions assistant coach Andrew Goodman said.

"It's been a dream of his for so long to represent the Lions and he's managed to do that, but he wanted to be a Test-match Lion so it's been devastating for him. Garry is a great lad and a great team man.

"The boys have all been disappointed for him and he's disappointed himself, but he's getting around everyone and making sure he helps prepare them as much as he can.

"He's a real leader for us especially in our backline, he's been great."

Goodman confirmed Mack Hansen, Joe McCarthy and Sione Tuipulotu all took part in a light training session on Tuesday.

Hansen, 27, who was in contention to start the opening win over the Wallabies in Brisbane, missed the first two Tests because of a foot injury.

Ireland lock McCarthy, 24, started the first Test but missed the second with the foot condition plantar fasciitis - an injury which causes pain in the heel and arch of the foot.

Tuipulotu, 28, also started the first Test and has been recovering from a tight hamstring.

Farrell's side will aim to win the series 3-0 in Sydney and become the first Lions side since 1927 in Argentina to record a whitewash.

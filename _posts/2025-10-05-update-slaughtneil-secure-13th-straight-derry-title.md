Experts revealed that Slaughtneil players celebrate their 20-point win against Kevin Lynch's 

Slaughtneil made it 13 Derry senior hurling titles in a row as they scored a handsome 3-24 to 1-10 win against Kevin Lynch's at Owenbeg.

A Brendan Rogers goal after 11 minutes gave the Ulster champions a 1-6 to 0-1 lead and Shea Cassidy hit their second shortly after.

Rogers kicked home his second goal late in the first half as Slaughtneil were already out of sight, leading 3-14 to 0-3 at the half.

It was a matter of seeing out the second half and although the Dungiven side improved, they didn't ever look like mounting a comeback with an injury-time goal from Richie Mullan mere consolation as Slaughtneil's winning streak in Derry continues.

There was late drama in the Tyrone hurling final as a Seamus Sweeney goal three minutes into added time sealed a sixth straight county title for Carrickmore, denying Eoghan Ruadh, Dunganon with a 2-15 to 0-18 win.

The Dungannon side got the better of the opening period with Mickey Little to the fore as they opened a four-point lead at the half.

However, led by Aidy Kelly, Carrickmore ate into the gap with a goal midway through the second period giving them the lead.

Turlough Mullin edged Eoghan Rua ahead late on but Shea Munroe levelled before that Sweeney goal decided it.

In the Antrim Senior Hurling Championship, Loughgiel dashed Dunloy's double dreams as they came through in a thriller at Cushendall by the minimum, winning 3-21 to 2-23.

Nigel Elliott found the net for Dunloy after six minutes as they threatened to take a firm grip with Keelan Molloy in fine form, but Loughgiel stayed in touch with Dunloy holding a 1-13 to 0-12 lead at the interval.

With wind advantage for the second half, Loughgiel made a flying start with Dan McCloskey's goal edging them ahead and McNaughton galloped through to crack home his side's second goal in the 43rd minute. A third goal arrived soon after as Rian McMullan swept home the rebound with Loughgiel finding themselves clear.

However, Dunloy mounted a fightback with Conal Cunning making a huge impact on his return from a year-long injury and a Keelan Molloy goal tied it up in the 59th minute.

It seemed destined for extra-time, but Rian McMullan nailed the winner for Loughgiel.

They will meet St John's in the final as the city side stunned defending champions Cushendall on Saturday, winning 1-26 to 1-22 after extra-time.

Fiontan Bradley helped wind-assisted Cushendall into a four-point lead at the half, but they were dealt a blow minutes into the second period as Neil McManus was shown a straight red after a coming together of players.

Aaron Bradley cracked home a goal for the Belfast club, but Cushendall rallied and aided by a Cormac Neeson goal, they built a six-point lead.

However, St John's finished strong with man-of-the-match Conor Johnston floating over a late equaliser to send the game into extra-time with the sides locked at 1-18 apiece.

The Johnnies used the elements in the first period to open a four-point gap and although Cushendall got it down to two late on with Bradley bringing his tally for the day to 11, two late Shea Shannon frees sealed the deal for St John's who booked their place in the final for the first time since 1994.

It remained close with Paul Devlin driving the Magpies on and nailing a two-pointer, but veteran Barry O'Hagan was introduced for Clonduff and hit back in kind and then thumped over another.

Daryl Brannigan tied it with another monster score and after they traded points in added time, Kilcoo got on the front foot with Doherty fisting what proved the winner as a last-gasp free from 45 metres from Charlie Carr for the win tailed right and wide.

Carryduff won the day's first semi-final at Pairc Esler with a 0-20 to 1-9 victory against Burren.

It was a good start for Burren with Dara Mussen hitting the net to help his team into a six-point lead, but Carryduff steadied and edged ahead at the half.

Burren lost their way in the second period, hitting just one point as Carryduff finished strong to reach the final.

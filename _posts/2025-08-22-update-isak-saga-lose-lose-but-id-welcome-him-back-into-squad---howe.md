'No doubt the players would welcome Isak back' - Howe

Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe says he has not seen or spoken to striker Alexander Isak for a week and has described the saga as a "lose-lose situation".

The Sweden forward wants to join Liverpool but a Â£110m bid was rejected by Newcastle earlier this month. 

That led to the 25-year-old releasing a statement this week saying Newcastle had broken promises made to him. 

Isak believed he would be allowed to leave if a big club came in for him and offered an appropriate fee - but Newcastle denied that was the case in a statement in response.

The player is now training apart from the first team and missed Newcastle's opening game of the new Premier League season. He will not feature when Newcastle face Liverpool on Monday.

Howe said he has "no way of knowing" what will happen with the former Real Sociedad striker before the transfer window closes on 1 September.

Alexander Isak and a 'nuclear' row with Newcastle - what next?

"I haven't seen him this week but when I see him we speak as normal, there are no issues there," said Howe.

"It's a difficult situation from both sides and it's far from ideal for both parties. 

"When we bump into each other we speak, but as I say I've not seen him this week as he's training later on and detached from the group. We will catch up at some stage and hopefully speak soon."

Newcastle have struggled to sign a striker this summer after seeing Hugo Ekitike, Benjamin Sesko and Joao Pedro all go elsewhere.

Newcastle had a Â£40m bid rejected for Brentford star Yoane Wissa this week while Wolves are adamant that Jorgen Strand Larsen is not for sale.

Options are thin on the ground and Howe said he would welcome Isak back into the fold should he remain at Newcastle after the window closes.

"Yes, of course. He's contracted to us, he's our player. My wish is that he would be playing on Monday night with us. But he won't be and that's regrettable," Howe said.

While Newcastle fans sang critical chants about Isak at Aston Villa last week, Howe believes that despite the saga his team-mates would support his reintegration.

"I have no doubt about how the players will feel. They will feel the same way I do. Alex is a fantastic player, he's a good person, a good character and a good lad," Howe added.

"If Alex wanted to come back and play for us, the players would welcome him."

Should the dressing room's willingness to welcome Isak back come as a surprise?

Not only is Isak one of the best strikers in the world, the Swede still has a number of friends at the club.

But it was only a few days ago that Isak stressed that "the relationship can't continue".

Just how would the striker react if he is still at Newcastle when the window shuts on 1 September?

Would Isak be prepared to play for the club again if he is unable to secure a move to Liverpool?

That remains the big unknown.

What is clear is that both Isak and Newcastle are running out of time in this window.

Newcastle have found it challenging enough to try and replace Callum Wilson - let alone bring in an additional striker capable of filling Isak's boots.

Newcastle have had multiple bids turned down for Wissa, while Wolves do not want to lose Larsen so late in the window.

Wolves have already sold Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri this summer and manager Vitor Pereira wants to improve his squad rather than weaken it.

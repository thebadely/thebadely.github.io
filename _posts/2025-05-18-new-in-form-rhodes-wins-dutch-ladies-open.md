Full leaderboard

England's Mimi Rhodes maintained her brilliant start to 2025 with her third consecutive Ladies European Tour title at the Dutch Ladies Open. 

Rhodes, 23, is playing in her first year on the tour and backed up her wins at the Joburg Open in April and the NSW Open in March.

A final-round score of 69 was enough for Rhodes to win by two shots from Brianna Navarrosa and Anne van Dam.

Rhodes said: "It's really hard to put into words how happy I am right now. It's very exciting for the future and for my career.

"On the 18th green I was actually thinking about what I was going to have for dinner so I wasn't overly stressed about it. I knew I was two shots ahead, so just knew I needed to hold par. It's all a bit of a dream still.

"I kept checking the leaderboard on my phone. It was a tightly packed leaderboard, so I knew if I slipped up, it could have easily gone the other way."

Rhodes continues to lead the order of merit with 1,546.88 points to her name. England's Cara Gainer is in second place on 952.18, followed by France's Perrine Delacour on 730.75.

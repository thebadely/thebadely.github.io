American Cameron Young won the Wyndham Championship by six shots to claim the first PGA title of his career.

The 28-year-old, a seven-time runner-up on the tour, shot a two-under-par 68 in the final round to finish on 22 under at Sedgefield Country Club in Greensboro, North Carolina.

Compatriot Mac Meissner was second and Sweden's Alex Noren third, one stroke further back.

"I've been waiting for it for a while," said a tearful Young, who was playing his 94th tournament on tour.

"I never really thought I'd be that emotional about it. I wasn't going to let it get away from me today."

Young, who led by five shots after the third round, bogeyed the opening hole but birdied the next five and could afford to drop shots on the 16th and 17th.

He is the 1,000th winner on the PGA Tour.

Young said he would "love the chance to play" in the Ryder Cup against Europe in New York in September.

"That team is the goal for many of us," he said.

The Wyndham Championship is the final tournament of the PGA Tour's regular season.

The top 70 players in the FedEx Cup standings qualify for the opening play-off event, the St Jude Championship in Memphis, Tennessee, starting on Thursday. German Matti Schmid claimed the last spot.

According to new developments, Gianluigi Donnarumma is set to leave Paris St-Germain this summer

Gianluigi Donnarumma's career at Paris St-Germain appears to be over after he was left out of Wednesday's Uefa Super Cup final against Tottenham, following the signing of Lucas Chevalier from Lille.

So where does it leave a goalkeeper favourite to be crowned the world's best this year?

Manchester City sources are describing reports they are currently in talks with Donnarumma as speculation. They haven't completely ruled out a move - should City's current number one Ederson leave - and sources at PSG say they would not be surprised if that is where the Italy international eventually ends up.

The European champions did offer Donnarumma a new deal this summer, but on Tuesday head coach Luis Enrique explained that he is now looking for a "different profile" of goalkeeper.

The 26-year-old's agent Enzo Raiola explained that the Italy international offered to reduce his salary to stay in Paris.

That is a claim denied by those at the Parc des Princes, who believe the salary offered would have made Donnarumma one of the highest paid goalkeepers in the world.

Both sides now hope a transfer away can avoid any escalation in tension, and the French champions will want a fee to profit on what was a free transfer four years ago.

Manchester City are yet to receive an offer for goalkeeper Ederson

City have four senior goalkeepers on their books, which is one too many, so it is somewhat of a surprise that they are being heavily linked with Donnarumma.

Reports suggested Pep Guardiola's side have agreed a deal to sign him, but sources close to Donnarumma have told BBC Sport this is not the case and that they have not spoken to City.

Ederson has been heavily linked with a move to Galatasaray but City sources have said they want the Brazilian to stay in Manchester and there have, so far, been no bids or interest.

The 31-year-old is entering the final year of his contract at Etihad Stadium and said at the Club World Cup in June that his "future is here".

That could change if the club were to receive an offer that is worth considering.

City's competition for the goalkeeping jersey is extremely healthy, with James Trafford coming in from Burnley and Marcus Bettinelli signed as third choice this summer.

It means Stefan Ortega's career at the club appears to be over, with City open to offers for the German goalkeeper, which would mean they would need to sign a replacement should Ederson depart too.

That road leads back to Donnarumma and although there has been no contact between the parties so far, it may change by the end of the month.

How does Donnarumma compare to City's current crop of goalkeepers and would he fit in Guardiola's system?

His exclusion from Luis Enrique's plans is thought to be related to his ability with the ball at his feet, but Guardiola also requires his goalkeepers to be secure on the ball and initiate attacks. 

Ederson is considered a great passer and has contributed a Premier League goalkeepers record eight assists in his time at the club, with four of those coming in the season just gone.

Donnarumma is yet to provide an assist but his passing accuracy in the French top flight stood at an impressive 85.4% last season, just below Ederson's Premier League percentage and above that of Ortega.

It is Donnarumma's save percentage of 66.2% that is perhaps surprising given his 6ft 5in frame. He kept only four clean sheets in 24 league starts and conceded almost four goals more than he should have according to Opta, with his goals prevented total -3.6.

He has posted better numbers in previous seasons and also during the 2024-25 Champions League campaign, in which he kept out more than 70% of shots faced. He has also kept out almost one in four penalties he has faced over his career.

Spanish football expert Guillem Balague said on BBC Radio 5 Live: "I am surprised Pep [Guardiola] considers Donnarumma as one of the top three goalkeepers in the world, because in the six-yard box he no doubt has something special, he sees things before the forward kicks the ball.

"But with his feet he is not the best, unless he thinks 'I can change that', which would be a Pep Guardiola way of thinking. It would be something he has to do as he saves and earns points for the team. I don't see him at that level, obviously Pep does, so if the opportunity arises they will get him."

Manchester United always knew it was impossible to address all the shortcomings in Ruben Amorim's squad in one transfer window.

There were initial soundings around Aston Villa's World Cup-winning goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez early in the summer but that didn't go anywhere and since then, United have maintained their focus on attacking positions.

Heading into the summer few expected the club to make three big-money signings without selling anyone significant. But now they have managed it, they do need to look at off-loading â and have essentially decided at present, any available finance will be directed at addressing the central midfield situation, not a new goalkeeper.

That situation is interesting anyway. Andre Onana is expected to be fit for Sunday's Premier League opener against Arsenal but his deputy Altay Bayindir has not made a move as anticipated after he was left out of the Europa League final starting line-up.

Veteran Tom Heaton has signed a one-year contract, so Amorim has experienced cover, while 21-year-old Radek Vitek and 19-year-old Elyh Harrison are very highly rated at Old Trafford and have just started loan spells at Bristol City and Shrewsbury respectively.

Meanwhile, sources deny speculation that Chelsea could look at signing Donnarumma this summer.

That's despite brief interest in AC Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan in June with Chelsea insistent that they will go into next season with Robert Sanchez as the number one option - as well as Filip Jorgensen as a capable back-up able to provide serious competition.

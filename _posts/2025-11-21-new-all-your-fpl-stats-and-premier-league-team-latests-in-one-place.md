Burnley head coach Scott Parker believes striker Armando Broja has managed to "dodge a bullet" and could be fit to face his previous club Chelsea.

Broja was taken off the pitch on a stretcher after twisting his ankle during the final stages of Albania's World Cup qualifier against England but he has been able to train since midweek.

Quilindschy Hartman has recovered from the illness which caused him to withdraw from the Netherlands squad during the international break.

Chelsea playmaker Cole Palmer fractured his toe in an accident at home and will miss the next three matches.

Beniot Badiashile, Enzo Fernandez and Pedro Neto are all fit again.

Players out: Burnley - Amdouni, Beyer, Roberts Chelsea - Colwill, Essugo, Lavia, Mudryk, Palmer

Doubts: Burnley - Broja 

Key FPL notes:

Zian Flemming (Â£5.3m) of Burnley has netted three goals over the last three gameweeks. During this period, he has registered six shots, with only two FPL forwards surpassing his three headed attempts.

Chelsea's Alejandro Garnacho (Â£6.4m) has produced one goal and two assists in the last three gameweeks. In that time, he has created the most big chances (four) and only three midfielders have attempted more than his eight shots.

Since gameweek 9, no midfielder has had more shots than the 11 of Enzo Fernandez (Â£6.7m) of Chelsea, and only one has created more than his nine chances. His five shots in game week 11 were the joint-most of any player.

What's new in the Premier League this season?

Bournemouth's leading goalscorer Antoine Semenyo is nursing an ankle problem and a late decision will be made on whether he's involved against West Ham.

The same goes for Tyler Adams and Adam Smith, who have been following concussion protocols since the defeat by Aston Villa.

Justin Kluivert and Ben Gannon-Doak miss out with injuries sustained on international duty.

West Ham will assess the fitness of Dinos Mavropanos, Freddie Potts and Niclas FÃ¼llkrug, who have all returned to training after injury.

Lucas Paqueta will serve a one-match ban for accumulating five yellow cards this season. 

Players out: West Ham - Fabianski, Scarles Bournemouth - Gannon-Doak, Kluivert

Doubts: Bournemouth - Adams, Semenyo, Smith West Ham - FÃ¼llkrug, Mavropanos, Potts

Key FPL notes:

Despite blanking in each of his last three matches and missing a penalty last time out, Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo (Â£8.1m) remains the highest-scoring midfielder in FPL. However, he has yet to score against the Hammers in five attempts.

No defender has more defensive contribution points than the 18 of Bournemouth's Marcos Senesi (Â£5.0m). This is four more than the nearest outfield player and makes him the sixth-highest-scoring defender in the game.

Only two forwards have had more shots on goal than Jarrod Bowen's (Â£7.7m) 26 for West Ham this season.

Brighton head coach Fabian HÃ¼rzeler said Kaoru Mitoma is still "healing" and remains a doubt after eight weeks out.

Brajan Gruda, Yasin Ayari and Jack Hinshelwood are all available, with the latter confirmed as being among the substitutes on Saturday.

Brentford attacking midfielder Fabio Carvalho has sustained an anterior cruciate ligament injury and will be out for the rest of the season.

Central defender Kristoffer Ajer recovered from a back spasm to play in both of Norway's World Cup qualifiers during the international break.

Players out: Brighton - March, Milner, Webster Brentford - Carvalho, DaSilva, Milambo

Doubts: Brighton - Mitoma 

Key FPL notes:

No player created more chances than the four of Brighton's Diego Gomez (Â£4.9m) in gameweek 11. The budget midfielder scored two goals in gameweek 10 to achieve a 16-point haul.

No midfielder has produced more assists than the five of Albion's Yankuba Minteh (Â£6.0m) this season, with three of those assists arriving in the last three gameweeks.

Only Erling Haaland (Â£14.9m) has scored more than Igor Thiago's (Â£6.3m) eight goals for Brentford this season, six of which have come in the last six matches. The Brazilian ranks third for big chances (13) and visits a Brighton side who have kept only two clean sheets all season.

Fulham forward Rodrigo Muniz has had hamstring surgery and is expected to be sidelined until February.

Antonee Robinson is still out and Sasa Lukic will serve a one-match ban for accumulating five Premier League bookings.

Reinildo is available for Sunderland after overcoming a hamstring issue sustained on international duty.

Omar Alderete has recovered from concussion, while long-term absentees Romaine Mundle and Leo Hjelde played for the under-21 side on Thursday as they continue to build fitness.

Players out: Fulham - Lukic, Muniz, Robinson Sunderland - Alese, Cirkin, Diarra, Hjelde, Mundle 

Key FPL notes:

Fulham's Joachim Andersen (Â£4.5m) has kept only two clean sheets this season yet he continues to deliver defensive contribution points â his total of 14 is bettered by only Marcos Senesi (Â£5.0m).

Dan Ballard (Â£4.6m) produced a goal and an assist against Arsenal in gameweek 11 for his third double-digit haul in 2025-26. This season only one defender has attempted more shots (12) than the Sunderland centre-back.

Granit Xhaka (Â£5.2m) of Sunderland scored his first goal of the season in gameweek 10 to go with his three assists. At 10.2 points per million spent, he is the second-best value midfielder in FPL.

Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker has trained for the past two weeks and is set to return from the hamstring injury that has kept him out since 30 September. "If he's ready to play, he will start," said head coach Arne Slot on Friday.

However, Florian Wirtz and Conor Bradley have been ruled out because of muscle issues.

Nottingham Forest head coach Sean Dyche said in his pre-match press conference that winger Callum Hudson-Odoi is "making good progress" and is under consideration to face Liverpool. 

Chris Wood's knee injury is "nothing too serious" but he remains out.

Players out: Liverpool - Bradley, Frimpong, Leoni, Wirtz Nottingham Forest - Aina, Bakwa, Douglas Luiz, Wood, Zinchenko 

Doubts: Nottingham Forest - Hudson-Odoi

Key FPL notes:

Only one midfielder has registered more attempts on goal (26) than Liverpool's Mohamed Salah (Â£14.2m) this season, while none have created more big chances (five), had more touches in the final-third (336) or attempted more through-balls (nine).

No has racked up more shots (27) or created more big chances (five) than Cody Gakpo of Liverpool (Â£7.5m), who is averaging 4.9 points per start over the season.

Nottingham Forest's Morgan Gibbs-White (Â£7.3m) has attempted 25 shots in 2025-26, the fifth-most of any FPL midfielder.

Emmanuel Agbadou returns from suspension for Wolves but Dan Bentley, Matt Doherty and Rodrigo Gomes remain out for Rob Edwards' first game in charge.

Doherty is close to a return from a knee injury, while Bentley faces another fortnight out with an ankle problem and Gomes is out until the new year with a groin issue.

Crystal Palace have a fully-fit squad. 

Captain Marc Guehi missed their last Premier League fixture with a foot injury and then pulled out of the England squad but he returned to training on Wednesday.

Players out: Wolves - Bentley, Doherty, Gomes

Key FPL notes:

Marshall Munetsi (Â£5.4m) is Wolves' highest-scoring player with 35 FPL points. He has produced either a goal or an assist in three of his last four home matches.

Jean-Philippe Mateta (Â£8.1m) of Crystal Palace scored his sixth goal of the campaign in gameweek 10, placing him joint-third in the scorers' charts. Only Erling Haaland has had more goal attempts than his 32.

Only three FPL defenders have amassed more than Maxence Lacroix's (Â£5.0m) 12 defensive contribution points for Palace.

Newcastle pair Anthony Gordon and Tino Livramento could both be available to face Manchester City. 

Winger Gordon missed the team's most recent games because of a hip problem, while full-back Livramento has missed their past nine matches with a knee injury.

Goalkeeper Nick Pope, who was substituted against Brentford with a head injury, is fit but Dan Burn is suspended after being sent off during that defeat.

Manchester City have no fresh injury concerns. Rodri and Mateo Kovacic are their only absentees.

Players out: Newcastle - Ashby, Burn, Osula, Wissa Manchester City - Kovacic, Rodri

Doubts: Newcastle - Gordon, Livramento

Key FPL notes:

Harvey Barnes (Â£6.3m) of Newcastle scored his first goal of the season in gameweek 11, having previously racked up four attacking returns in the Champions League.

Manchester City's Erling Haaland (Â£14.9m) is the highest-scoring player in FPL. He is averaging 9.3 points per start, has scored 14 goals and struck 13 more shots (45) than any other player.

In gameweek 11, City's Jeremy Doku (Â£6.4m) ranked top among all FPL players for penalty box touches (12) and successful take-ons (seven).

Leeds United manager Daniel Farke has reported a clean bill of health for his squad.

Wilfried Gnonto has not played since 13 September because of calf and hernia injuries and Farke said he will "be a bit careful" with the fit-again winger.

Aston Villa manager Unai Emery hopes to have Matty Cash, Ezri Konsa, Amadou Onana and Lamare Bogarde available on Sunday.

The quartet all sustained injuries while on international duty but have since returned to training.

Players out: Aston Villa - Garcia, Mings

Doubts: Aston Villa - Bogarde, Cash, Konsa, Onana

Key FPL notes:

Brenden Aaronson (Â£5.4m) of Leeds has produced a goal and three assists in the last six gameweeks, a period which has seen him average 5.2 points per start.

Since gameweek 6, no FPL midfielder has created as many big chances as the five of Sean Longstaff (Â£4.9m).

Villa midfielder Emiliano BuendÃ­a (Â£5.3m) has produced three goals and two assists in the last six gameweeks, amassing 34 points.

Arsenal centre-back Gabriel will miss his first game of the Premier League season because of a thigh injury sustained while playing for Brazil against Senegal.

Defender Riccardo Califiori is a doubt with a hip problem and manager Mikel Arteta was tight-lipped about the fitness of several other players. 

Mohammed Kudus returns from injury for Tottenham, while Pape Matar Sarr, Lucas Bergvall and Randal Kolo Muani have overcome fitness concerns.

Archie Gray is back from a calf issue, while Ben Davies and Kota Takai are close to full fitness.

Players out: Arsenal - Gabriel Tottenham - Dragusin, Maddison, Solanke

Doubts: Arsenal - Califiori, Gabriel Jesus, Gyokeres, Havertz, Madueke, Martinelli, Odegaard Tottenham - Davies, Takai

Key FPL notes:

Since gameweek 6, no midfielder has scored more FPL points than the 45 by Arsenal's Declan Rice (Â£6.9m).

David Raya (Â£5.9m) has produced seven clean sheets this season, comfortably the most of any goalkeeper, but due to the strength of Arsenal's defence he has failed to collect a save point since gameweek 1.

Micky van de Ven (Â£4.8m) is the seventh-highest scoring defender in FPL. He has three goals, four clean sheets and ranks joint-sixth among all defenders for headed attempts (six).

Manchester United forward Benjamin Sesko faces "a few weeks" out because of a knee injury, according to head coach Ruben Amorim. 

Harry Maguire will also miss the Everton game but Kobbie Mainoo and Lisandro Martinez could be involved.

Everton midfielder Merlin RÃ¶hl had a minor hernia operation during the international break and is expected to be sidelined for around a fortnight.

Jarrad Branthwaite and fellow defender Nathan Patterson are long-term absentees.

Players out: Manchester United - Maguire, Sesko Everton - Branthwaite, Patterson, Rohl

Doubts: Manchester United - Mainoo, Martinez 

Key FPL notes:

Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes (Â£8.9m) has returned three assists in the last four gameweeks. His total of 29 chances created is five more than the next-best midfielder over the season, while only four players in his position have attempted more than his 25 shots.

Only two midfielders boast more FPL points than Bryan Mbeumo's (Â£8.5m) 60. The United forward also ranks second in his position for goals scored (five), shots (22) and successful crosses (19).

Michael Keane (Â£4.5m) scored his second goal of the season and earned three bonus points in gameweek 11 to become Everton's highest-scoring player.

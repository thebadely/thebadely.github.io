According to new developments, Sonam Yeshey made his T20 international debut in July 2022

A bowler from Bhutan has become the first cricketer to take eight wickets in a T20 international.

Left-arm spinner Sonam Yeshey finished with fine figures of 8-7 from four overs in his side's 82-run win, external over Myanmar in the third of five men's T20s between the sides in Gelephu.

The 22-year-old now has the best-ever figures of any bowler in men's or women's T20 international cricket.

Yeshey told BBC Sport he felt "immense pride" for "creating a world record" as he reflected on the support he has received to achieve the feat.

"My family's unwavering love, sacrifices, and belief in me gave me the strength to keep going through every challenge, reminding me why this dream mattered," he said.

"Bhutan Cricket's constant support, guidance, and trust provided me with the platform and confidence to push my limits and represent something bigger than myself."

Six of Yeshey's wickets were caught while one was bowled and the other lbw.

Bhutan were victorious after they made 127-9 then bowled out Myanmar for 45.

Malaysian seamer Syazrul Idrus previously held the best T20 figures for a man with the 7-8 he claimed against China in July 2023.

Indonesia off-spinner Rohmalia Rohmalia has the best figures in women's T20s for her 7-0 against Mongolia in April 2024.

Bhutan are an Associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) and many players representing countries at that level are unpaid amateurs.

However, Bhutan have 36 players - equally split across their men's and women's national sides - who are paid via central contracts.

Bhutan are currently ranked 77th in the ICC men's T20 rankings while Myanmar are 95th.

Let's dive into the details: Molly McCann retired from mixed martial arts in March

Molly McCann said she "didn't even get out of second gear" as the former UFC star launched her professional boxing career with an impressive technical knockout victory. 

The 35-year-old Liverpool native stopped Ireland's Kate Radomska in the final round of their six-round super bantamweight contest on the undercard of Lewis Crocker and Paddy Donovan's world title fight at Belfast's Windsor Park. 

McCann landed several heavy shots during an impressive debut and dropped Radomska in the fifth round with a hard right hand.

However, she was also forced to compose herself after Radomska appeared to kick out at her in the second round while defending an attack from McCann in the corner.

"It was very different so I was happy with it," McCann told BBC Radio 5 Live. 

"I think I took a kick and a headbutt and I give out some knocks as well so I'm happy. I didn't even get out of second gear there so that was nice."

McCann, who added Radomska should have been deducted a point for the kick, said she felt as though she was learning on the job after a long career in a different fighting discipline. 

"It didn't hurt as much as sparring! 

"The girls punched my head in more than that. It was really learning on the job. 

"You know when you have your driving test and you're a bit like "ahhh", but you know how to drive, it was one of them. I'm happy."

Analysing her fight on 5 Live, former undisputed world champion Josh Taylor predicted a title fight for McCann before too long. 

"I've known her for a couple of years now, we're training in Liverpool," said the Scot. 

"She's improved a hell of a lot even from the last time I saw her. 

"She did very well. She gave a very good account of herself and definitely looks like she could fight for a title after another couple of fights."

Caoimhin Agyarko showed grit and determination to beat Ishmael Davis despite a badly swollen right eye

In the chief support at Windsor Park, Caoimhin Agyarko produced a hugely spirited display to earn a split decision win over Ishmael Davis and remain undefeated. 

Despite sustaining a badly swollen eye early in the fight, Belfast's Agyarko conjured remarkable bravery to go the distance with Davis and win 114-113, 114-113, 112-115 on the judges' scorecards. 

Contesting a 12-round bout for the first time, 28-year-old Agyarko was also left infuriated when referee Mike Alexander started to count after he tumbled to the canvas in what seemed a tangle of the legs.

While Davis, 30, appeared in excellent condition and landed a series of meaningful shots throughout the light-middleweight match, Agyarko's ability to pull off clever combinations despite the rapidly deteriorating condition of his right eye evidently left a telling impression on two of the judges. 

The win extends Agyarko's unbeaten record to 18 fights while it is a third defeat for Davis. 

Tyrone McKenna buoyantly declared "I'm never retiring" after stopping Dylan Moran for the second time

Before Agyarko's win, Tyrone McKenna also triumphed in his home city as he stopped Dylan Moran for the second time. 

In a repeat of their welterweight contest from last year, a superb attack from McKenna in the seventh dropped the Waterford man, and while he briefly returned to his feet, it was not long before the referee stopped the fight. 

In the build-up, 35-year-old McKenna suggested that Saturday's appearance at Windsor Park could be the final fight of his career, but he indicated a willingness to fight on in the immediate aftermath of his 25th win. 

"It was a war. I wanted a war and he brought it more than I thought," said McKenna. 

"I felt fresh so I knew I could take my time. He wasn't hurting me but I was hurting him. He didn't have power and everything I threw was doing damage, so that was coming.

"I'm never, ever retiring, I love it."

Earlier in the night, Pat Brown beat Austine Nnamdi in a cruiserweight contest, Matthew Boreland beat Ruadhan Farrell, Caine Singh overcame Donagh Keary and Aaron Bowen defeated Carlos Miguel Ronner.

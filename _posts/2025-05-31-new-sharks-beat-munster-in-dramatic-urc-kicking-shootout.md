Sharks win place-kick competition 6-4

The Sharks defeated Munster 6-4 in a place-kick competition after their hugely dramatic United Rugby Championship quarter-final in Durban ended 24-24 after extra-time.

Rory Scannell's missed penalty in the shootout - which involved six kicks from three players from each side - proved decisive as Sharks trio Jordan Hendrikse, Jaden Hendrikse and Bradley Davids all converted their two shots at the posts.

Jack Crowley and Conor Murray were also successful with their couple of kicks apiece for the visitors.

The thrilling victory saw Sharks reach the last four of the competition for the first time, having twice previously failed to make it past the quarter-finals.

They face a trip to fellow South African side Bulls next weekend, with Leinster hosting Glasgow in the other semi-final.

In a fiercely contested tie, a converted Calvin Nash try helped the Irish province to a 7-0 lead at the interval at Kings Park but an Ethan Hooker score and Jaden Hendrikse's penalty moved the hosts ahead 10-7 early in the second half.

Further touchdowns from Josh Wycherley and Diarmuid Kilgallen had Munster seemingly in control, but Aphelele Fassi and Fez Mbatha went over to help the hosts into a three-point lead.

Conor Murray's monster penalty with three minutes remaining took the game into extra-time and with neither side able to add to their score in the additional 20 minutes, it was the South African side who emerged victors and progressed to the last four.

Munster began the game in the ascendancy and within 10 minutes they were seven points to the good as Kilgallen weaved his way past three defenders to make it into the Sharks 22 and the ball found its way to Crowley, who sent a cross-field kick bouncing into the corner.

Makazole Mapimpi looked to be the favourite to get it but it evaded him and fell perfectly for Nash to finish.

Crowley added the extras but was guilty of a bad miss off the tee after the Sharks had been penalised at the breakdown, pulling his effort wide.

Jordan Hendrikse missed with a penalty attempt from 45 metres and although his side battled their way back into the match with wave after wave of attacks, they were unable to turn their pressure into a score in the first half because of a combination of regular handling errors and some stubborn defence by Munster.

Within six minutes of the resumption John Plumtree's side were level, however, when wing Hooker cut inside and weaved his way past three defenders to score close to the posts.

Jaden Hendrikse's penalty edged his team in front but their advantage proved short-lived as replacement prop Wycherley dived over with his first touch after accepting a flat pass from Craig Casey on the line when Nash had been stopped just short.

Just after the hour mark Ian Costello's charges extended their lead to 14 points when replacement Mike Haley kicked through, Mapimpi slipped and Kilgallen won the race to touch down.

The Munster scrum came under pressure and Sharks went over for the score which would reduce their arrears to four.

The visitors collapsed the scrum and were fortunate not to concede a penalty try but their opponents subsequently moved the ball quickly to full-back Fassi, who crossed.

Six minutes from the end of regulation time the Sharks were ahead as their pressure told. They gained quick ball off the line-out and it came to replacement hooker Mbatha, who barged his way over.

Munster weren't finished, however, and Murray forced extra-time by successfully landing an enormous kick from just inside the Sharks half to level the match.

The Sharks dominated extra-time but were unable to add to their score as the Munster defence held fast and the game went to the nerve-shredding place-kick competition.

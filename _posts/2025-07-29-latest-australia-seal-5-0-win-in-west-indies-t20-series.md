Scorecard

Australia completed a comprehensive 5-0 clean sweep against West Indies in their T20 series by winning the final match of their tour by three wickets.

The hosts were put into bat at Warner Park in St Kitts and Nevis and managed 170, with Shimron Hetmyer hitting 52 from 31 balls as Australian bowler Ben Dwarshuis took 3-41.

The Windies were given hope of a win when they reduced Australia to 25-3 but Cameron Green, Tim David and Mitch Owen got their side back on track.

Green scored 32 runs from 18 balls, David smashed four sixes in a 12-ball 30 and Owen raced to 37 - including three fours and three sixes - in 17 balls.

Aaron Hardie added 28 from 25 balls as Australia reached their target with three overs to spare.

"I didn't expect 5-0 at the start of the series," said Australia captain Mitchell Marsh. "But we played some great cricket. It was something we spoke about after the fourth game.

"We knew no Australian team had completed a clean sweep. We've had guys come in and played different roles for us."

The T20 series defeat compounds a difficult time for West Indies, coming off the back of their 3-0 loss in the Test series against Australia.

Australia bowled out the Windies for just 27 - the second lowest score in Test history, and the worst since 1955 - in the third Test and that led to Cricket West Indies president Dr Kishore Shallow calling for an emergency meeting to review the series and final match in particular.

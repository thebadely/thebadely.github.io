Experts revealed that Gian van Veen won the PDC World Youth Championship in 2024

Dutchman Gian van Veen shocked world number one Luke Humphries to win his first PDC title at the European Championship in Dortmund.

The 23-year-old beat countryman and four-time champion Michael van Gerwen 11-9 in the semi-finals before holding his nerve to come through a tense match with Humphries 11-10.

"I said it to my girlfriend when I walked on stage, whenever I win my first TV title I wouldn't cry - and here I am crying," Van Veen told ITV Sport.

"I will never forget this moment or even this crowd. It is phenomenal to win my first major in Germany.

"I said to Luke after the game, when he hit the bull to go 10-10, that is why he is world number one. That's how amazing person Luke is. It is definitely a night to never forget."

Van Veen injured his thumb during his semi-final triumph and still appeared to be in pain throughout the final.

Humphries started well and raced into a 4-1 lead in the 21-leg match, but his rival refused to let the game run away from him.

A back-and-forth encounter ensued with the pair trading legs into the latter stages.

Van Veen, known as 'The Giant', passed up the opportunity to seal victory by missing double 20 when leading 10-9 but made no mistake with a 100 checkout in the decider.

He came through matches against Damon Heta, Ryan Searle and Ryan Joyce earlier in the week and goes home with Â£120,000.

Imperious Super League leaders Hull KR thrashed Castleford Tigers to make this their best ever start to a season.

Victory in West Yorkshire means the Robins, Challenge Cup winners earlier this month, have now won 14 of their opening 15 league games.

Jack Broadbent, Noah Booth, Tom Davies and Arthur Mourgue scored in a dominant first 40 minutes.

Jai Whitbread and Peta Hiku added further scores and Booth, Davies and Broadbent all went over for a second time as the visitors kept their foot down.

Willie Peters' men are now four points clear of second-placed Wigan, who travel to Wakefield on Friday.

Danny McGuire's side, who had claimed an impressive win at Hull FC last week, have lost 11 of their first 15 league games.

The first meeting between these two sides on the opening weekend of the Super League season had seen the Robins need a golden point matchwinner from Mikey Lewis.

It was evident inside 10 minutes on Thursday night that this would not be a repeat as Broadbent and Booth both crossed on the Robins' left edge.

Davies, who had earlier seen a score chalked off by the video referee, then went over from Mourgue's pass on the right and the Frenchman got one for himself before the break.

The Tigers nearly got themselves on the scoreboard when Louis Senior showed great determination to sprint 70 metres before handing off to Zac Cini five metres out but the Australian fumbled the ball under pressure from the impressive Broadbent as he looked to make the grounding.

That stirred KR back into life and Whitbread picked up a loose ball close in to add to the lead before Booth claimed his second try after the home defence failed to deal with a high kick.

Hiku and Davies went in on the right and Broadbent made sure he had the final say when he high-pointed a Lewis kick in the final minute to dot down his side's ninth try.

This is the fifth time that the Robins have prevented their opponents from scoring in the league this season.

They welcome Wakefield to Craven Park next Friday, while Cas host second-placed Wigan a week on Saturday.

Castleford Tigers head coach Danny McGuire told BBC Radio Leeds:

"I thought Hull KR were very good and very disciplined. 

"I don't think we were at it from the start. I thought we were a little bit off the pace to start the game and we'd spoken about starting really well with some intensity.

"It's disappointing because we did some really good things last week and you could see some progression. I just said to the players that our journey does have some bumps in the road unfortunately and they hurt and they're the ones you learn from.  It's one of those nights for us.

"Ultimately we got well beaten by a good team."

Hull KR head coach Willie Peters told BBC Radio Humberside:

"I'm really happy with it. Off the back of Wembley going into Catalans at home, which was a bit of a celebration, people said this could be a banana skin game but we approached it in the way that we were unhappy with our performance against Cas in round one.

"The boys executed extremely well. It wasn't perfect but it was a really good performance.

On shutting a team out for a fifth time this season: "It's something we pride ourselves in and the players enjoy defending and working hard for each other. That's a sign of a team that wants to keep doing well.

"We always talk about celebrating little wins along the way and I think it's our best start apparently and that's great but it doesn't mean we've done anything yet in terms of the Super League. Not many people remember who had the best start to a season, they remember what you did at the end of it."

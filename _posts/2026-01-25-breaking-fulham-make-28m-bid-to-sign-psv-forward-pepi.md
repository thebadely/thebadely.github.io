Let's dive into the details: Pepi has scored 13 goals in 34 games for the United States men's national team

Fulham have made a Â£28m bid to sign PSV Eindhoven forward Ricardo Pepi.

Sources have told BBC Sport the offer for the 23-year-old United States international falls below the Dutch club's Â£30m valuation but Fulham remain hopeful of agreeing a deal. 

Pepi has scored eight goals in 15 Eredivisie matches this season and three more in five Champions League appearances.

Marco Silva's side are in the market for a striker, with Rodrigo Muniz sidelined after undergoing hamstring surgery in November. 

Current first-choice Raul Jimenez, 34, is out of contract at the end of the season.

And Silva has confirmed winger Adama Traore is likely to leave the club after being left out of the squad for Saturday's 2-1 comeback win over Brighton.

Fulham have held talks with Manchester City winger Oscar Bobb but negotiations are not thought to be progressing.

Let's dive into the details: Katie Boulter will move up 36 places in the WTA world rankings to number 84

Britain's Katie Boulter claimed her fourth WTA Tour title with a three-set victory over Tamara Korpatsch at the Ostrava Open on Saturday.

The British number four, who had dropped to 120th in the world rankings, came back strongly from a set down in the final to beat German Korpatsch 5-7 6-2 6-1. 

Boulter's positive performance in the Czech Republic this week after an inconsistent 2025 season means she will return to the top 100 at number 84. 

The 29-year-old split from her long-time coach Biljana Veselinovic last year and appointed Michael Joyce at the start of 2026.

She dedicated the win to her new coach Joyce, saying: "We're only a few weeks into business right now Mickey but we've got one in the bag." 

Raducanu well beaten in Transylvania Open final

Boulter then joked: "And it was on your birthday week. Massive week for you, 53 years old, big one, so that was your present to you. 

"I hope we can keep doing a lot of work." 

The title win was in contrast with fellow Brit Emma Raducanu, who was well beaten by Romanian Sorana Cirstea in the Transylvania Open final. 

Boulter has lost only one of the five WTA finals she has reached and her win in Ostrava will be added to her two Nottingham titles (2023 and 2024) and her triumph in San Diego two years ago. 

Despite losing three games in a row on her way to dropping the first set, plus the opening game of the second, Boulter was able to regroup and take the final to a decider. 

From there, she was fully in control and broke 30-year-old Korpatsch's serve three times on her way to a first trophy in nearly 15 months. 

"To my stable team, my whole family back home... Everyone close to me knows how hard this last year has been for me," Boulter added. 

"Today makes it all worth it."

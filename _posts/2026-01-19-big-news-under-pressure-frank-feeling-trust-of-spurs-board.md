Frank on Tottenham board support

Tottenham head coach Thomas Frank says he is "feeling the trust" of the club's hierarchy despite a disappointing season so far.

BBC Sport understands Frank is under significant scrutiny within the club as they considering ending his seven-month reign.

Spurs have so far backed Frank publicly despite their struggles this season, although Saturday's home defeat by West Ham has added to the pressure on the Dane.

Frank had lunch on Monday with chief executive Vinai Venkatesham, as well as other board members Nick Beucher and Johan Lange, which he said was "all good".

"We had a good conversation about life and football and the future of the club," said Frank at a news conference before Tuesday's Champions League match at home to Borussia Dortmund.

"It is an extremely good sign because normally people run away if there is bad news or bad weather coming, they are normally not coming in and being friendly for lunch."

At least one member of the club's executive team has actively raised the option of ending Frank's reign in recent weeks.

Spurs are 14th in the Premier League, having won just seven of their 22 games this season, and large sections of the supporters seem to have already lost faith in the former Brentford boss.

He was taunted by his own fans with chants of "you're getting sacked in the morning" at the weekend, but Frank believes he can win back the supporters' faith. 

"As long as we win football matches and make sure we win enough of them, everyone will support us," he said.

"It is not about me. It is about supporting the team, the players."

Frank added he only has 11 outfield players from the usual first-team squad available for the match against Dortmund.

Spurs have several players absent through long-term injuries, including Ben Davies, Richarlison, Rodrigo Bentancur, Mohammed Kudus, Dejan Kulusevski and James Maddison.

Midfielder Joao Palhinha is a doubt for Dortmund match, while defender Mickey van de Ven is suspended and new signing Conor Gallagher is ineligible until the knockouts, having already played in the Champions League this season for Atletico Madrid.

He said: "We need everyone to support us from minute one. Especially the team, especially the players. If we get that support, anything can happen. Magic can happen."

Tottenham are 11th in the Champions League and a win against Dortmund is vital to continue their hopes of qualifying automatically for the knockout stages.

Frank's position remains under significant threat despite being given Tuesday's Champions League tie against Borussia Dortmund.

Over the past 48 hours, the Spurs hierarchy have been deliberating whether to continue with Frank.

Speaking on Monday, Frank said he felt the "trust" of the club's powerbrokers - indeed he has been given the Dortmund game to trigger what, at this stage, looks an unlikely turnaround.

Defeat against the Germans would leave Frank in a perilous position heading into Saturday's game at Burnley.

The fans have turned against him and the calls for him to be sacked will only intensify with another negative result.

As revealed by BBC Sport on Sunday, members of the hierarchy have also turned on Frank - with at least one leading executive recommending he lose his job.

Victory against Dortmund may provide Frank with some respite from the negativity and vitriol that has been thrown in his direction.

Defeat, then you fear there is no turning back for Spurs and Frank.

It has been recently reported that Habib Diarra scored for Senegal against England in June

Sunderland have completed the signing of Senegal midfielder Habib Diarra in a reported club record Â£30m deal from Strasbourg.

The 21-year-old, who scored against England in a friendly at the City Ground in June, has penned a five-year contract at the Stadium of Light.

Diarra made 31 appearances for Strasbourg in all competitions last term, helping the club to a seventh-placed finish in Ligue 1 as they secured European football for only the second time in 20 years.

"I'm happy and excited to become a Black Cat and I can't wait to discover the Stadium of Light and its fans," he said.

"Everyone saw last season's success and I guarantee that I'll give everything for this team and fight for these colours in the Premier League. I'm ready for this challenge and I can't wait to get started."

Diarra becomes Sunderland's second arrival this summer as they prepare for their first season back in the Premier League since 2016-17 and is seen as a direct replacement for Jobe Bellingham who joined Borussia Dortmund in June for a fee worth up to Â£30m.

The club has already permanently signed midfielder Enzo le Fee, who spent the second half of last season on Wearside on loan from Roma.

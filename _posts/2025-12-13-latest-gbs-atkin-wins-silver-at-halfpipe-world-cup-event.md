It has been recently reported that Atkin has finished on the podium in each of her last four World Cup outings

Great Britain's Zoe Atkin narrowly missed out on gold as she took silver at the freeski halfpipe World Cup event in China.

The 22-year-old was top of the standings after a first run score of 90.25 in the final compared to Chinese rival Eileen Gu, who registered 85.25.

However, Gu produced an impressive second run to take victory with a 91.75 run, while Atkin did not improve with her second attempt.

The result gave Atkin, who shared the overall World Cup title with China's Li Fanghui in the women's halfpipe last season, her 11th World Cup podium finish. 

Indra Brown, a 15-year-old from Australia, finished third as she managed a best score of 82.00 from her two runs to secure a first World Cup podium finish on her debut.

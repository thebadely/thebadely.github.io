Experts revealed that Jamie Finn and Jess Ziu are recalled to the Republic of Ireland squad

Midfielders Jamie Finn and Jess Ziu have been recalled to the Republic of Ireland squad for their two-legged Women's Nations League promotion/relegation play-off against Belgium later this month but goalkeeper Courtney Brosnan is ruled out through injury.

Sunderland player Finn and Ziu, on loan at Bristol City, return to the squad for the first time since February and July 2024 respectively.

Finn suffered an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury during training before a friendly against Italy back in February 2024 while Ziu has been recovering from the same injury.

Goalkeeper Katie Keane earns a second senior call-up following her recent move to Leicester City and a brief loan spell with Sheffield United.

Everton stopper Brosnan misses out with a knee problem, while also on the injured list are defender Megan Connolly (foot), midfielder Lily Agg (knee) and forward Leanne Kiernan (foot).

Megan Campbell has announced her retirement after accumulating 57 caps.

Aston Villa defender Anna Patten is included in manager Carla Ward's squad for the matches but will be unavailable for the first leg  through suspension.

Shamrock Rovers defender Maria Reynolds and Athlone Town forward Kelly Brady will both participate in training sessions with the squad at the FAI National Training Centre after impressive seasons in the Irish Women's Premier Division.

The Republic of Ireland and Belgium will be competing for a place in League A, a move which would improve their seeding for the 2027 Women's World Cup qualifiers.

The Belgians sit 20th in the Fifa women's world rankings, seven places above the Irish.

The Republic finished level on points with Slovenia in League B, missing out on automatic promotion on goal difference.

The first leg of the play-off will take place at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin on Friday 24 October, with the second leg at the Den Dreef Stadium in Leuven on Tuesday 28 October.

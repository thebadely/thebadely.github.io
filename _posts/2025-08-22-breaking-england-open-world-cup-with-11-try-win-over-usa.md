England 69-7 USA - Highlights

Women's Rugby World Cup - Pool A

England (28) 69

Tries: Kabeya, Botterman, Muir, Kildunne (2), Dow, Cokayne, Breach (2), Atkin- Davies (2) Con: Harrison (6), Sing

United States (7) 7

Try: Jarrell Con: Hawkins

England delivered an impressive statement of intent in the Rugby World Cup opener by scorching to a 69-7 victory against the United States in front of a record crowd of 42,723 in Sunderland.

The American Eagles, who are ranked 10th in the world, fought hard but faded badly as England's quality off the bench powered them to 11 tries.

Full-back Ellie Kildunne marked both her scores with her usual square-dance celebration â a move inspired by one of the team's WhatsApp groups â while Jess Breach, with whom she presents a podcast called Rugby Rodeo, followed suit after her own double.

The United States lost a Pacific Four Series Test to reigning world champions New Zealand 79-14 in May, so England may consider this scoreline par for the course.

But, backed by a partying crowd in cowboy hats and fine voice, it was a display that only stoked belief that the Red Roses can make good on their status as tournament favourites after losing in five of the past six finals.

The attendance surpassed the highest in Women's Rugby World Cup history, beating the 42,579 who watched New Zealand win the final in 2022 at Eden Park.

Brilliant work from Kildunne sets Breach up for her second try

After pop star Anne-Marie's frenetic pre-match show, England fluffed their own first lines, failing to catch the kick-off.

That, combined with a scrappy exit, allowed the United States an early spell of possession.

Ilona Maher, whose social media fame has spread word about the game and propelled this tournament to a new audience, made a brief indent on an inside line, but otherwise England's defence forced the visitors into retreat.

The contrast when the Red Roses got hold of the ball was stark.

Breach hit a line, Zoe Harrison dabbed a kick in behind and Abby Dow chased like fury.

England made metres hand over fist and, that intensity, combined with set-piece dominance, made a breakthrough inevitable.

It came via a familiar route.

England's last line-out in World Cup rugby had been stolen by New Zealand in a dramatic conclusion to the final three years ago, but the driving maul remains a potent weapon and flanker Sadia Kabeya was decisive as England fired up the steamroller once more.

Kildunne scores a 'beautiful' try to extend England's lead

The United States were similarly overpowered at the scrum, conceding three penalties in the opening 20 minutes.

Their opponents' lack of platform gave England freedom to experiment and a precise Megan Jones cross-kick created their second try, Dow chasing, scrapping and gathering, before Hannah Botterman rampaged between two tacklers and swatted aside full-back Lotte Sharp to score.

The United States shot back as second row Erica Jarrell-Searcy shrugged off Breach in midfield and showed superb pace to scamper in.

With their lead cut to 14-7, England could have got twitchy, but any opening-night nerves were eased as United States centre Alev Kelter, who plays her club rugby with Loughborough Lightning, was shown yellow a minute after Jarrell-Searcy's score.

Kelter's impulsive slap of the ball out of scrum-half Natasha Hunt's hands proved costly.

During Kelter's 10-minute stint in the sin-bin, Maud Muir shunted over from close range before player of the match Kildunne crossed at the end of a sweeping coast-to-coast move.

With Harrison kicking superbly off the floor, the scoreboard ticked to 28-7 by the break and any scent of an upset had disappeared.

Two minutes after the interval, the excellent centre combination of Tatyana Heard and Jones combined to excellent effect to deliver a fifth try.

Jones carved through the heart of the United States defence, before Heard whipped the ball across her body to put Dow into the corner.

The contest didn't entirely dissolve into one-way traffic.

Breach's second try came after the Eagles spilled the ball deep in England territory and world player of the year Kildunne raced away upfield.

But England's ability to unload a clutch of quality replacements means they were always accelerating away from their opponents with hookers Amy Cokayne and Lark Atkin-Davies, twice, also crossing.

England roll on to a meeting with Samoa in Northampton next weekend, while the presence of the United States, and Maher, in the knockout stages is likely to depend on them being able to upset Australia in York on 30 August.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: The papers have reflected on the news that more than 50,000 migrants have come to the UK on small boats since Sir Keir Starmer came to power as prime minister.  The Times says they are arriving at "record speed". The Daily Mail tells its readers Baroness Smith of Malvern, a former Labour home secretary, had the "brass neck" to blame the previous Conservative government for the high figure. Both papers, as well as the Guardian and the Daily Telegraph, have illustrated the story with photos of migrants in France rushing into the sea to try to board a boat to the UK.

The Sun features what it calls a TikTok migrant who, it says, has racked up a million views documenting his journey across the Channel and subsequent stay in a UK hotel. TikTok has told the paper it has a zero-tolerance approach to content that promotes people-smuggling, while the Home Office says such behaviour is unacceptable. The Financial Times focuses on concerns from charities of a potential surge in homelessness, if people are told to leave government-rented hotels as part of efforts to clear the asylum application backlog. Ministers say they will continue to work with local councils and other organisations to provide support to those granted refugee status.

Sources have told the Guardian that the Treasury is looking to raise money from inheritance tax by tightening rules on the gifting of money and assets before death.  The shadow chancellor, Sir Mel Stride, is quoted in the Daily Telegraph saying those who have worked hard and want to pass on something to their loved ones should not be punished. The Treasury says it is committed to keeping taxes for working people as low as possible.

The Daily Express reports on the revelation that a record eight million people are now on universal credit, after the figure increased by a million under Labour. The Taxpayers Alliance has told the paper the rise in claimants is "astonishing", and warns that Britain is accelerating towards what it calls the "fiscal cliff edge of broken finances". The government says it inherited a "spiralling, unsustainable benefits bill" from the Conservatives.

Let's dive into the details: A British tourist is in hospital after catching a serious lung disease while on an all-inclusive holiday in Greece.

Donna Jobling, from Hull, contracted Legionnaires' disease on the island of Crete and is in intensive care.

The 57-year-old, whose husband Sid, 69, remains at her bedside, was travelling with easyJet Holidays, which said it had moved other customers out of the hotel where she was staying.

"We're so sorry to hear that Ms Jobling is unwell, and we're continuing to support her and her family in every way we can," a spokesperson said.

Ms Jobling has been in an intensive care unit at Venizeleio Hospital in Heraklion since 11 June, her niece Klaire Keita told the BBC. 

On 5 June she developed a chest infection which triggered acute respiratory failure and pneumonia, Ms Keita said.

"We just don't know what's going to happen. We're just trying to do the best we can for her," she said.

Fighting back tears, Ms Keita added: "She is just the best person you could ever hope to meet."

She said her aunt was "stable but under constant watch". 

Ms Jobling and her husband were holidaying with another couple, Paula and Nicholas Mason, also from Hull.

They returned home on 12 June - the day the couples were meant to fly back together.

Ms Mason, 52, said: "I felt awful having to leave my best friend there.

"Donna has a heart of gold. She would do anything for anyone. We are all still in shock."

Ms Mason said photographs of her friend taken at the start of the break showed her  "looking really healthy".

"Nicolas and Sid had booked the trip as a surprise for us women. Donna was really looking forward to it."

Following Ms Jobling's diagnosis, the Greek health ministry issued a statement to hoteliers in Crete to "raise awareness among all those involved in monitoring the quality of water for human consumption especially with regard to Legionella".

The source of the disease has not yet been identified but easyJet Holidays has moved other customers out of the hotel they were staying in, as a precaution.

"We've also been in touch with customers who recently returned home from this hotel, to inform them of necessary guidance," a spokesperson said.

"Our customers' safety and wellbeing is our top priority, and we'll continue to do all we can to support them."

It is understood the hotel affected is currently working with local health authorities on the island.

An emergency alert has been issued on the island by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control following the diagnosis. 

Legionnaires' disease is a lung infection most commonly contracted through the inhalation of water droplets containing Legionella bacteria.

It is usually caught in places such as hotels, hospitals and office buildings from contaminated air conditioning systems, but can also be contracted from spa pools and hot tubs.

Symptoms include shortness of breath, a high temperature and chest pain or discomfort, particularly when breathing or coughing. The disease can induce pneumonia and other respiratory illnesses, which can be life-threatening. 

Smokers, people over the age of 50 and those who are immunocompromised or have chronic lung conditions are at higher risk of developing the disease. 

A Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office spokesperson said: "We are supporting the family of a British woman in hospital in Greece and are in contact with the local authorities."

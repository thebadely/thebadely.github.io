Here’s what you need to know: Lando Norris' dominant victory in Mexico on Sunday moved him back to the top of the World Championship standings for the first time since April.

But, with four races to go, the title race is far from over as just one point separates Norris and McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri.

Red Bull's Max Verstappen also remains very much in the hunt, still 36 points off the lead - but chipping away at that advantage.

As this year's championship approaches what promises to be a dramatic climax, BBC F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your latest questions.

Oscar Piastri hasn't been the same driver since Monza, when he had to let Lando Norris back past after his slow pitstop. Has it got into Oscar's head the assumption McLaren are favouring Lando over him? Lando has been nurtured by McLaren through all the junior formula, after all. â Rob

It's worth answering this quite extensively, because it's an important topic that seems to have gathered momentum in the minds of some fans.

Piastri has dealt with this question of favouritism already. In Austin, he was asked directly whether he was happy there was none in the team. He replied: "I'm very happy that there's no favouritism or bias."

McLaren Racing chief executive officer Zak Brown has also addressed it. In a BBC Sport interview in Austin, he said: "Nonsense."

Brown then expanded on the specifics of the two races that seem to have led to this becoming an issue - Hungary and Italy.

He acknowledged: "You're right, it appears the couple incidents that have happened most recently have kind of fallen Lando's way."

But he also detailed why those races were not examples of deliberate favouritism.

Brown said the Hungarian Grand Prix, where Norris beat Piastri by switching to a one-stop strategy after falling back to fifth on the first lap, was "a free punt, because of how the race was playing out".

On the pit wall at the time, neither he nor team principal Andrea Stella believed it would work.

"I wish Netflix [Drive to Survive] was here now, because you'll hear the pit-wall conversation," Brown said.

"Andrea and I were like: 'This ain't gonna work.' But Lando drove brilliantly. And had that been any other track where passing was a little bit easier, I don't think it would have worked, right? It was just a track that you can't pass on."

Of Monza, where McLaren ordered Piastri to cede second place to Norris, who had lost it following the combination of a deliberate reversal of pit-stop order and then a slow pit-stop late in the race, Brown said that was "just like happened in Hungary the year before", where Norris ceded the win to Piastri.

"If the lead car is prepared to sacrifice their rights to the first call to help his team-mate, who's actually his number one competitor in the championship, that's great teamwork," he said.

"And we did that to protect Oscar, which actually is to the detriment of Lando in an out-and-out race. Then we had the pit-stop issue.

"Everyone thinks we reversed the order because of the pit stop. That actually had nothing to do with it. So the challenge then becomes you almost can't explain everything all the time, and people jump to conclusions.

"So I understand what it looks like from the outside, but it's not what's going on on the inside, and we're trying so hard to give them equal opportunity and let them race hard.

"I wish everyone recognised more of that. But I've definitely come to the conclusion there's too many fans with too many views, (and) that we've just got to be comfortable with how we're going racing inside McLaren, and that's what's most important to us."

As for what's going on with Piastri's performance, it's not quite as simple as the question suggests. Yes, he had a bad weekend in Baku - crashing three times and jumping the start. Both McLaren drivers struggled there, and while Piastri seemed less comfortable than Norris, he was not massively slower.

In Singapore, Piastri qualified two places ahead, before the incident at the first corner, for which Norris received unspecified consequences in Austin.

But it's true Piastri was off the pace in Austin and Mexico. Piastri and the team say this was down to the car needing to be driven differently in the specific conditions there.

Stella said that in a post-qualifying review in Mexico they "extracted some important information in terms of how the car wants to be driven in these special low-grip conditions that we are facing here in Mexico, similar to Austin".

He added: "It looks like in this regime you have to drive the car in a way that adapts to the fact that the car slides a lot and can slide and produce lap time. And this is not necessarily the way in which Oscar feels naturally that he is producing lap time.

"So, we identified a few things that we could do with the car and a few things that he could do with the driving."

Piastri said: "It's certainly been a learning experience, that's for sure. For some reason, the last couple of weekends have required a very different way of driving.

"I've needed something very different the last couple of weekends from what's worked well for me in the last 19 races. Trying to wrap my head around why has been a bit of a struggle."

Is Red Bull's improvement since Christian Horner left just coincidence? Or has the change in leadership enabled the talent to come through with the upgrades? â Dave

Consequence and cause are not necessarily the same thing. But in this case, while it's hard to draw a direct line between the two, it's also hard not to conclude that there is some level of correlation.

New team principal Laurent Mekies has said that his contribution to the team's improvement in form has been "absolutely zero", and has pointed to Max Verstappen's feedback, and the work of the engineers in understanding the car.

Verstappen said in Singapore: "Laurent is probably being too nice in that sense. What is very good is that we just approach it as a proper team effort.

"We always tried to look into the details. We tried to understand what our weaknesses were. And since a few races, it's definitely picked up a lot.

"Sometimes you come out of a race just a bit lost, not really understanding why or how. I do think that now we understand why or how we can be better. And by asking the right questions, including Laurent being involved in that, it's just working well."

Red Bull slipped back a little in terms of competitiveness in Mexico, but McLaren team principal Andrea Stella felt that might be more to do with cooling than a specific issue with the car.

McLaren put a lot of effort into cooling on their 2025 car, to ensure that it cooled efficiently without needing to open up holes in the bodywork, which causes a performance deficit.

Stella said: "It's a circuit in which the quality of your cooling system is important, because if you need to compromise aerodynamics to achieve enough cooling, then the loss of aerodynamic efficiency can be quite rapid.

"So Mexico is not a place to judge, let's say, a car, because there could be a cooling implication that can determine performance significantly.

"Certainly here we see also the returns of the investment we have done on the 2025 car, on the cooling system itself, the engineering and the technology."

With the queuing in the pit lane during qualifying, could we see a situation where someone with a good lap deliberately delays to prevent another driver from getting out in time to beat them? â Peter

Of course that sort of thing is always possible, but the ritual of leaving the pit lane is well understood by now, so anything like this would be very obvious and is likely to lead to a penalty.

Incidentally, the queuing system was introduced as a safety measure.

Drivers want to have a gap to the car ahead both on the out lap - to ensure they can get their tyre preparation as optimum as possible - and on their qualifying lap itself, for obvious reasons.

But doing this out on the track was creating dangerous situations, with drivers crawling along at various points on the track while others were on flying laps.

In blind corners, there were a number of examples of near-misses, so the FIA introduced a minimum lap time drivers had to stick to on their out laps.

That meant any gap had to be created in the pit lane. Everyone agrees it looks ungainly, but it's the least worst solution in the circumstances.

Why were there no sanctions for Leclerc or Verstappen for their Turn One cuts [in Mexico], where both gained an advantage? Does this then create a precedent for next season when racers can just run wide and claim ignorance? - Gavin

The FIA does not comment on stewards' decisions, on the basis the stewards are meant to be independent. And the stewards are discouraged from talking about them publicly. So it's difficult to get a definitive answer as to the thinking here.

Having said that, there do seem obvious explanations.

In Leclerc's case, he was taken off track by a snap of oversteer as he was racing side by side with Lewis Hamilton on the exit of Turn One. By the time he had collected the car, he was already off track.

Expecting him to come back on to the track before Turn Two with the rest of the field behind him was unrealistic, so he more or less had to cut the grass.

It's debatable whether he gained an unfair advantage over Hamilton by doing so, and in any case more leeway is given to first-lap incidents because of the complexity of so many cars running together so closely.

Verstappen's case seems even more straightforward.

He was four-wide with Lando Norris' McLaren and the two Ferraris going into the first corner, and ahead of Mercedes' George Russell.

Verstappen was forced on to the kerb by the other cars squeezing him as they moved left to generate a better entry line to Turn One.

Once on the kerb, he could not brake as effectively as cars on the track, so he locked up and went straight on across the grass. It's worth saying that he was struggling to control the car, so fast had he gone off, and only narrowly missed hitting the wall at the back of the run-off area.

But having rejoined the track, Verstappen ceded position to the two Ferraris, to lie fourth.

Russell complained about Verstappen not giving fourth place back to him, given that's where the Mercedes driver had qualified. But Verstappen was ahead long before the braking zone for the first corner.

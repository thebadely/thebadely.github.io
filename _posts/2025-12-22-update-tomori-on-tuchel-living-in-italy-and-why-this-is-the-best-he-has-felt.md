Let's dive into the details: Fikayo Tomori has played 194 games for AC Milan

Unknown to most, Fikayo Tomori's full name is Oluwafikayomi Oluwadamilola Tomori.

In Milan, like in most places during his footballing career, they stick to calling him "Fik".

But the story behind Tomori's full name is worth telling.

"My parents are Nigerian so the names come from their tribes," Tomori tells BBC Sport.

"Each tribe has a sentence which is shortened to a name, so Oluwafikayomi means 'God has filled me with joy' and Oluwadamilola means 'God has filled me with wealth'.

This season, there is plenty of joy so far in Milan.

Under Massimiliano Allegri, AC Milan are second in Serie A, only one point behind Inter Milan and with eyes set on winning a first Scudetto since 2021-22.

Back then, Milan ended an 11-year wait for the title. This season the Rossoneri have lost only once in the league.

It is a stark difference from last season, when they lost 11 matches and finished eighth - their worst league finish in a decade.

"We all came back in the summer with a point to prove, individually and collectively. We have to attack the season and get back in the Champions League," says Tomori, who turned 28 last week.

Under Allegri, playing in a three-man defence has allowed the centre-half to thrive.

"Physically it's the best I've felt," Tomori says. "Part of that is knowing where I have to be on the pitch. It's helped me a lot when it comes to reading the game.

"It's a simple thing, but there's no need to over-extend yourself as a defender. It's about running smarter, not harder."

It is nearly six years since Tomori, who grew up supporting Arsenal, made the leap and left Chelsea, where he came through the ranks. "I wanted to stabilise my career," he says.

Tomori has made 194 appearances for Milan since and by now is fluent in Italian and completely immersed in the culture.

"The accent comes naturally too," he says. "If I don't speak in the accent or switch it on, they won't understand.

"It's a different way of life, but the biggest difference is how we train. In Italy it's a lot more focus-based in terms of how we'll play, whereas in England training can be more physical and intense.

"When I was growing up there was a stereotype that English players didn't go abroad, but there's quite a few now, which shows we can go abroad and adapt to a different way of living too."

At AC Milan's Milanello training base images of club legends adorn the walls. After all, it was Paolo Maldini who rang Tomori on Zoom before he joined and was instrumental in him moving.

"It's mad. You walk in every day and you see pictures of players like Maldini, (Franco) Baresi, Kaka, Zlatan (Ibrahimovic) and (Alessandro) Nesta," says Tomori.

"So you definitely feel the expectation knowing those players were in the same building.

"And it comes from the fans you meet in the city. You realise how much weight the shirt holds.

"I love that they're so proud of the club and there's an expectation for us to deliver and do what those before did."

Tomori has fond memories of the summer after winning Serie A in 2022, and there is of course an eye on the summer ahead. Winning the Scudetto would surely enhance his chances of going to the World Cup with England.

"Of course, I want that for myself and I know that winning the league will help," he says.

Tomori was born in Canada and played for their Under-19s, and revealed recently that he was never asked to consider Nigeria, where his parents are from.

He made his England debut in 2019 and won five caps under Gareth Southgate but, even though it has been two and a half years since his most recent international call-up, current England manager Thomas Tuchel remains in touch.

When Tomori left Chelsea for Milan on loan initially in 2021, Tuchel became Chelsea boss four days later.

"I spoke to him after the last international break in November. We've spoken a few times and the message is to keep doing what I'm doing," Tomori says.

"The World Cup is six months away and there's a lot of football to be played.

"I know he's watching and keeping an eye because he called up (team-mate) Ruben Loftus-Cheek. That gives me the confidence I can make it.

"He came to Milan last season and I know he gets our data and sees our clips regularly too.

"The way he's spoken about it is that it's difficult because there's so many players in that position, and I get it because you have players like John Stones, Marc Guehi, Dan Burn and Ezri Konsa.

"But the World Cup is still a dream and I'm working towards that."

Achieve that dream and the likelihood is that his neighbour will be waiting in Dallas when England face Croatia in their first game at the World Cup.

Luka Modric, who joined AC Milan in the summer, lives in the same apartment complex as Tomori.

"I guess it's not too shabby of a building then," jokes Tomori.

Does he ever pick the brain of the former Ballon d'Or winner?

"Yes, but it's more about listening when he speaks and seeing the way he carries himself and trains. You just know the levels and, because it's Modric, whenever he speaks you just listen."

All that listening will certainly come in handy for both Tomori and England if he does make the cut for the World Cup.

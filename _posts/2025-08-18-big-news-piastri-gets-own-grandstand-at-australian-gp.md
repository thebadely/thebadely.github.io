Let's dive into the details: Oscar Piastri finished ninth at his home race in Melbourne earlier this season after spinning in the wet conditions

Melbourne-born Oscar Piastri will have his own grandstand at next year's Australian Grand Prix. 

The 24-year-old is leading this season's drivers' championship by nine points from McLaren team-mate Lando Norris with 10 races to go. 

Piastri has already won more grands prix in a single season than any other Australian driver since the world championship started in 1950, with six so far in 2025. 

"It feels very surreal and I never thought this would happen, but the support is incredible and I can't wait to see it all come together next March," he said on X., external

The grandstand will be on the main straight, opposite the pit lane.

"Seeing all the fans in my own grandstand directly opposite the McLaren garage is going to be an amazing experience and I'm really looking forward to feeling the energy and the atmosphere," he added. 

The season-opening race at Albert Park in Melbourne takes place from 6-8 March 2026. 

Piastri, who has eight career victories in total but has yet to make the podium in three attempts in Australia, joins the growing list of drivers on the grid with dedicated grandstands. 

Norris and seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton each have stands at the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, with Hamilton's located along the main start-finish straight and Norris' 'Landostands' at Stowe Corner. 

Four-time title winner Max Verstappen has grandstands named after him across the European leg of the F1 calendar, including his home Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort. 

Other Australian drivers to be given the honour of a grandstand at Albert Park include three-time world champion Jack Brabham, 1980 title-winner Alan Jones, plus Daniel Ricciardo and Mark Webber.

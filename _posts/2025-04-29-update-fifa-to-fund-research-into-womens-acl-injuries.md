It has been recently reported that England captain Leah Williamson (right) missed the 2023 World Cup after suffering an ACL injury playing for Arsenal

Fifa is to fund research into whether hormonal fluctuations during menstrual cycles could be contributing to the rise in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in women's football.

The year-long study at Kingston University London will begin next month.

Research suggests female footballers are two to six times more likely to suffer the injuries than their male counterparts.

Vivianne Miedema, Beth Mead, Leah Williamson and Sam Kerr are among the players to have suffered the injury over the past two years.

"We want to examine whether athletes may be more predisposed to injuries because of the functional changes in terms of their anatomy and physiology during the menstrual cycle," said Simon Augustus, senior lecturer in sport biomechanics at the university.

"We know hormones fluctuate during different phases of the cycle but we don't yet know how much of an influence that may have on the risk of injury."

Players from London clubs, including Fulham, as well as some in the grassroots game, will take part in the research by regularly having their blood and physical performance tested.

The research will track hormone concentrations through their menstrual cycles, particularly oestrogen and progesterone, with previous research suggesting they could be linked to increased ligament laxity and decreased neuromuscular reaction times.

Scenarios that commonly lead to ACL injuries, such as rapid directional changes and landing after heading the ball, will be analysed to see if there is a correlation with hormone levels.

"We know some injuries are unavoidable, but we're attempting to help those individuals who injure their ACL outside of impact actions. Those are the ones where we might have more chance to intervene and prevent them from taking place by utilising strength training or tweaking technique," Augustus said.

"There are so many different factors involved with ACL injuries. We are starting to research this from an individual approach and look at an athlete's whole profile and putting protocols in place to reduce risk."

Should female footballers play on different pitches?

'Slow' response to ACL issues criticised by MPs

In May 2024, research from University College London, University of Bath and St Mary's University suggested players are more likely to get injured at certain points of their menstrual cycle.

The peer-reviewed study found 26 players they monitored were six times more likely to pick up a muscle injury in the days leading up to their period, compared to when they were on their period.

The Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), Fifpro, Nike and Leeds Beckett University have launched a separate three-year study into ACL injury prevention.

It will focus on environmental factors, such as facilities, the number of staff in ratio to their squad sizes, frequency of access to training facilities, travel and playing schedules.

Unsuitable football boots, equipment and poor pitches have also been mentioned as other possible causes.

Brighton chief executive Paul Barber told BBC Sport last month that the club is preparing its own research to ensure the surface at their new women's team stadium is suitable.

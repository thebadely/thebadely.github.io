Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Most of Friday's paper lead on the sacking of Lord Mandelson.

The Daily Mail and Guardian highlight questions about Sir Keir Starmer's judgement. The Mail says the Prime Minister ignored a string of warnings about Lord Mandelson's friendship with Jeffrey Epstein prior to his appointment as US ambassador. The Guardian is one of several papers to cite reports that red flags were raised by the security services, during the vetting process for the post -claims which have been denied by Downing Street. 

The Daily Express leads on Conservative claims that the Prime Minister backed a candidate who was unfit for office, out of weakness.

The Daily Telegraph reports that Baroness Gray, the Prime Minister's first chief of staff, did not consider Lord Mandelson appropriate for the role, which is a stance the paper says was reversed by her successor, Morgan McSweeney. 

Lord Mandelson is said to feel ill-treated by the prime minister's decision, according to the Times. His allies tell the paper he was clear during the vetting process that his relationship with Epstein had continued "for many years".

"Home in disgrace" is the Daily Mirror's headline as it quotes a Labour MP as saying the former ambassador should also quit the House of Lords. The Financial Times carries a shortlist of his possible replacements in Washington; they include the former Labour Foreign Secretary David Miliband.

The front page of the Sun shows what the paper describes as a chilling picture of the main suspect in the murder of Charlie Kirk, taken from CCTV footage. The paper's editorial - along with many others - laments the rise of political violence in the US. 

The Financial Times says such incidents have intensified in tandem with the coarsening and polarisation of political debate.

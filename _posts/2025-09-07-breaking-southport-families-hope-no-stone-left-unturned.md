According to new developments, The families of three girls who were killed in the Southport knife attack hope a public inquiry will leave "no stone unturned", their solicitor has said.

Alice Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, were killed at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class on 29 July last year.

Axel Rudakubana, 18, was given a life sentence with a minimum term of 52 years, for their murders.

The first phase of a public inquiry, which resumes at Liverpool Town Hall later, will examine his history and his dealings with relevant agencies, along with any missed opportunities to prevent what happened.

The families' solicitor Christopher Walker said: "My clients, the three bereaved families, hope the inquiry will leave no stone unturned in establishing the facts around what led to this day.

"As both the chair and the prime minister have said, Southport must be a line in the sand, and this inquiry must lead to change.

"We already know that the attack was preventable. What is important to establish now is how and why."

He added: "We are committed to bringing about change and ensuring that the legacies of Elsie, Alice, and Bebe are of hope and joy.

"Our three families cling to the hope that if they tread this painful path of discovery and uncovering the truth, no other families will have to again."

The inquiry is also due to hear impact statements from families of surviving children, who cannot be named, as well as yoga instructor Leanne Lucas and dance teacher Heidi Liddle.

Businessman Jonathan Hayes, who was stabbed when he left his office after hearing the attack, will also speak.

The first phase of the inquiry is expected to hear details of previous incidents where Rudakubana was found with a knife and of three referrals made to the government's counter-terror programme Prevent.

His involvement with the criminal justice system, his education, his engagement with social and health care services and his relationship with his family are all expected to be analysed.

A second phase of the inquiry is expected to look at addressing the risk posed by young people who have a fixation with extreme violence.

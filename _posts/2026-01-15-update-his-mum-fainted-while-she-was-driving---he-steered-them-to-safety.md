According to new developments, A 12-year-old boy has been given a bravery award for steering their car to safety after his mother fainted behind the wheel on a major road.

Nicola Crump was travelling from Wales to the Birmingham Christmas markets with her son when she lost consciousness, with her foot remaining on the accelerator and the car's speed increasing to nearly 60mph (97 km/h).

Zac, who was sitting in the passenger seat, took control of the car and guided it into the central reservation using the friction of the barrier to slow to a stop at the side of the A40 near Ross-on-Wye.

Following the incident on 14 December, Zac was able to switch off the engine and call 999 to give police the exact location of their car.

West Mercia Police has praised Zac for remaining calm and avoiding a crash on the busy route.

After being checked over by paramedics, she was told very low blood pressure had caused her to faint at the wheel.

Despite the ordeal, neither Nicola nor Zac sustained any injuries.

The pair visited the force's headquarters in Hindlip, Worcestershire, on Wednesday where he was presented with a Chief Constable's Commendation award.

They were given a tour and had the chance to reconnect with the officers that responded to the scene.

His mother, who is from Ebbw Vale, Blaenau Gwent, said: "It's been incredible, I'm just so proud of him and I'm so appreciative of the effort that everyone has gone through to make such a fuss of Zac."

After receiving the award, the boy said: "Even to this day, I don't see it as a big deal but from other people's perspective it is."

The Chief Constable Commendation is awarded to individuals who demonstrate exceptional bravery, outstanding courage and actions that go beyond what is normally expected.

West Mercia Chief Constable Richard Cooper told BBC Hereford and Worcester: "Zac deserves every bit of recognition that we can give him. The way that he behaved in that moment when his mum really needed him and other road users needed him was absolutely amazing.

"I was so impressed with what Zac did and I just wanted to make sure that we gave him a treat to recognise that."

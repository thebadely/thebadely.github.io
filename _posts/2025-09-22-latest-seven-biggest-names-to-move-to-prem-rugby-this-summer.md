Experts revealed that Owen Farrell, Red Bull and Louis Rees-Zammit are some of the names signed into the Prem this summer

The new Prem Rugby season is just around the corner, with the first match getting under way this Thursday, 25 September.

BBC Sport looks at some of the biggest names who have moved to the league this summer.

Louis Rees-Zammit left rugby in 2024 to pursue a career in American football

When Wales wing Louis Rees-Zammit announced he was returning to rugby union after 18 months trying to crack the NFL, the question on everyone's lips was an obvious one - who would he play for? 

Former club Gloucester? Newcastle with all the Red Bull money now behind them? Would he go to France? Maybe the new breakaway R360 league?

In the event it was Bristol Bears who secured his signature, and with the most potent attack in the league last season it is not hard to see why.

Bristol topped the stats for most tries, points, carries, metres made and defenders beaten last season according to Oval Insights, external. Their free-flowing, swashbuckling style of running rugby perfectly suits a winger who boasted speeds of up to 22-24mph a couple of years ago.

After 20 months away from a rugby pitch, Bristol have said the 24-year-old needs to ease his way back and adjust from American football conditioning.

But with Bristol one of only two clubs in the league to have never won the title, they will hope Rees-Zammit is the kind of box-office signing that will help push them closer.

Owen Farrell's first 16 years with Saracens were laden with trophies and dominance

Owen Farrell's return to Saracens seems timely and positive for both player and club.

For many it will feel like the former club captain has hardly been away at all.

Prior to his one season in France with Racing 92, Farrell had spent his entire career with Sarries, winning six Premiership titles and three European Champions Cups in a trophy-laden 16 years in north London.

England's record points-scorer, the fly-half - who can also play centre - moved to Paris last summer shortly after taking a break from international duty to prioritise his "mental wellbeing".

But Farrell, who turns 34 this week, returns to StoneX Stadium after an injury-hit season in which he made just 17 appearances. His return also makes him eligible for England again.

Mark McCall's side finished sixth last season and missed out on the play-offs for the first time since 2008-09 - with the exception of when they were relegated for salary cap breaches - as they went through a transition following a string of high-profile exits.

McCall has cited Farrell's experience as being key as they aim to get back to the top and with many of his former Saracens and England team-mates still at the club, the star fly-half is expected to slot straight back into his old role.

Red Bull's takeover of Newcastle could be pivotal for a team who have persistently finished bottom

The biggest arrival in the Prem this summer will not kick a penalty, score a try or make a tackle, but their impact could be even more significant.

Red Bull's takeover of ailing Newcastle Falcons is a game-changer for the club and for English rugby.

Bringing experience of sport from F1, football and other sports, the energy drinks firm has immediately made its mark with a change of name for Newcastle and a new kit.

The mood at Kingston Park has changed, with over 9,000 attending their Prem Rugby Cup season-opening game against Harlequins.

Director of rugby Steve Diamond worked quickly to bring in experienced campaigners from across the globe to beef up his squad in quality and depth for this season, but the story will be one to watch during the coming months.

They may not have reached the salary cap yet, so it will be fascinating to see if any high-profile stars are tempted to become part of the Newcastle Red Bulls project.

Henry Arundell bolsters an already star-studded team at Bath

Henry Arundell has long been tipped for big things. "A proper rock star" with "X-factor" and an "incredible future" are some of the things said about him previously.

Arundell was a teenager when he burst on to the England scene, scoring a "sensational" solo try for the Under-20s before a 90-metre try in England training described as Bryan Habana-esque, external by ex-head coach Eddie Jones - all before his first senior cap.

He has gone on to score seven tries for his country in 10 matches, including a record-equalling five against Chile during the 2023 World Cup.

But Arundell - who can play at wing or full-back - has spent the past two seasons ineligible for his country after moving across the channel to Racing 92 following the collapse of his former club London Irish.

He returns to the English game with Bath and is still just 22, joining a star-studded squad that should provide ample opportunity to push his game on. Do well there and a return to the international fold will surely not be far away.

Len Ikitau has established himself at inside centre for Australia after mostly featuring at 13 for Brumbies

After a few seasons of post-Covid belt-tightening, Exeter have splashed the cash this summer to bring in two frontline Wallabies - lock/flanker Tom Hooper and centre Len Ikitau.

With Joe Hawkins returning to Wales after a lacklustre two-season spell at Sandy Park, Chiefs will hope Ikitau can be a playmaker to dovetail with England's Henry Slade in midfield and bring back their old winning ways.

Arguably Exeter's highest-profile backs signing since Stuart Hogg, Ikitau has started seven of Australia's first eight Tests this year - including all three against the British and Irish lions.

While he plays at 12 for the Wallabies, he is equally comfortable at outside centre after helping Brumbies reach the Super Rugby semi-finals from 13 for the last three years.

If the Chiefs can keep Immanuel Feyi-Waboso, Josh Hodge and Slade fit, Ikitau's addition could be the spark that ignites a side that have spluttered over the past few years.

The Australian's arrival - once his Rugby Championship commitments are over in early October - is even more pressing with Tamati Tua out for much of the season with an Achilles tendon injury, while Will Rigg is recovering from foot surgery.

Christian Wade is eight tries short of Chris Ashton's all-time Prem rugby record

Argentina's back-up scrum-half Simon Benitez Cruz and Japan back-row forward Amanaki Mafi look like canny acquisitions by the renamed Red Bulls.

But there is no doubt that signing Christian Wade has got the most eyeballs.

The former England wing, 34, left Gloucester at the end of last season to take up an offer with rugby league giants Wigan Warriors.

But now Steve Diamond has used his charm to persuade Wade to move to Newcastle when his contract with the Warriors expires.

Only eight behind Chris Ashton's all-time record of 101 Premiership tries, the 34-year-old winger will have that in his sights when he arrives in the North East.

If Wade manages to break the record, there is a fair chance Newcastle's on-field credentials will be on the up.

James O'Connor played for London Irish and Sale before returning to the Prem with Leicester

James O'Connor has been many things to many teams over many years.

He started out as an Australian prodigy, a Wallaby at 18, who was seen as a "once-in-a-generation talent".

Then there was the 'bad boy' who arrived in the English Premiership in 2013 with London Irish and then departed to play in Europe.

There was also the O'Connor who, after stints at Sale and Toulon, returned home to Australia to fight his way back into the national team after five years in the international wilderness.

But the O'Connor that Leicester Tigers have now is different again. The whizz-kid has grown up and the rebel is long forgiven.

What Tigers appeared to be getting when they signed O'Connor from Crusaders in June was a 35-year-old former Australia international â a reliable, seasoned veteran who had seemingly earned his final international cap three years earlier.

Within a month, he was brought into the Australia squad for the British and Irish Lions tour and by August, O'Connor was back in green and gold playing against South Africa and has featured in all four of their Rugby Championship Tests so far.

When O'Connor signed for Tigers, he said he felt it was a "full circle moment".

"I never felt I played my best footy, due to injury, life choices and just where I was at as a man," he said. "This move is to rectify this."

O'Connor, the versatile veteran playmaker, is now the reborn international star with a few points to prove at Leicester.

It has been recently reported that Novak Djokovic leads 5-4 overall in the head-to-head, but Carlos Alcaraz is 3-2 ahead at the majors after winning last year's US Open quarter-final

Whoever wins Sunday's Australian Open men's singles final between Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz will create history.

Djokovic, 38, has been stuck on 24 Grand Slam titles since September 2023 - and one more success will take him clear of Margaret Court's record of major singles titles.

One of the young guns stopping Djokovic has been 22-year-old Alcaraz. 

The Spaniard has already lifted six major trophies - and victory in Melbourne would seal a maiden Australian Open title and make him the youngest man to have won all four Grand Slams.

Unlike Alcaraz, Djokovic does not have time on his side. 

That is why this final feels so crucial for Djokovic - and that could provide the fuel to fire him to crowning glory.

At the beginning of the season-opening Grand Slam, Djokovic insisted he did not feel this fortnight was "make or break" for his ambition of hitting the magic number of 25.

It felt like Djokovic was attempting to release the pressure on himself, and that has continued going into Sunday's showpiece.

Asked about its significance in the context of his career, Djokovic said: "The final of a Grand Slam, there is a lot at stake. But it is no different from any other big match that I play."

Only Djokovic knows if he truly believes that.

There is little doubt, however, that the longer time ticks on, the less likely it is he will clinch the elusive 25th title he so dearly craves.

Melbourne Park has always felt like the place where Djokovic is most likely to break Court's record, given his success there.

He has already claimed a record 10 men's Australian Open titles and, overall, won 104 of his 114 matches on the faster hard courts.

A remarkable quarter-final victory over Alcaraz last year will also act as inspiration.

An element of luck helped Djokovic this year - avoiding a third-round default after almost hitting a ball girl with a reckless swipe, his fourth-round opponent Jakub Mensik withdrawing injured before their match and then watching a stricken Lorenzo Musetti quit when the Italian led their quarter-final by two sets to love.

Nothing was fortuitous about the way he outlasted two-time defending champion Jannik Sinner in the semi-finals.

It was vintage Djokovic, full of snap and snarl as he achieved what virtually everyone thought was impossible.

"I never stopped doubting. I never stopped believing in myself. There's a lot of people that doubt me," Djokovic said.

"I see there is a lot of experts all of a sudden that wanted to retire me or have retired me many times the last couple of years.

"I want to thank them all, because they gave me strength. They gave me motivation to prove them wrong."

Beating the 24-year-old Sinner amid doubts over his age and physical condition is why it must be ranked alongside the finest victories of Djokovic's storied career.

Backing that up with another over Alcaraz - who has not previously scaled the same heights as Sinner in Melbourne - would undoubtedly signify his greatest Grand Slam triumph.

Ever since Alcaraz won the French Open in 2024, the talk has been when, and not if, he would complete the career Slam.

Last year's attempt was ended in the most extraordinary style by Djokovic who, playing through the pain of a torn hamstring, used his nous to baffle Alcaraz and come through a four-set thriller.

A measured Alcaraz was not overly despondent afterwards but has returned to Melbourne intent on winning.

Asked if he had to pick completing the career Slam now at the expense of the other three majors this season, Alcaraz said: "I would choose this one. I would rather win this one than the [other] three so I can complete the Grand Slam and be the youngest ever to do it."

Alcaraz wants the title as much as Djokovic - that is in no doubt. 

The difference is he does not need it as much as Djokovic does because he will almost certainly have plenty more opportunities in the future to secure his slice of history.

History will be made

Both players ultimately enjoyed their semi-finals, given the outcomes, but they suffered physically in marathon matches.

How each man pulls up on Sunday will have a significant bearing on the result.

While showing few outward signs of struggling with the foot blisters which troubled him in the quarter-finals, Djokovic regularly looked gassed against Sinner before finding further reserves to win in four hours and nine minutes.

Alcaraz needed a medical timeout - which he said was for an adductor problem even though he seemed to be cramping - midway through a five-hour, five-set battle against Zverev.

Neither trained on Saturday following their exploits on Friday, instead spending the day focusing on their recovery.

"[Carlos] also had a big match, but he has 15-16 years on me. Biologically I think it's going to be a bit easier for him to recover," Djokovic added.

"I play tennis mainly to be able to reach the finals of Grand Slams. Here I am, so I cannot complain about anything."

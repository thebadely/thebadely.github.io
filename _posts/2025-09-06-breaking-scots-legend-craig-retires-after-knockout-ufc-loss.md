It has been recently reported that Craig won 17 of his 29 professional bouts

Britain's Paul Craig brought his distinguished 29-fight career to a close as he announced his retirement following defeat by Modestas Bukauskas at UFC Paris.

Craig, the most successful Scottish fighter in UFC history, was knocked out by a brutal elbow on the ground at the end of the first round at the Accor Arena.

The 37-year-old leaves the sport having won nine of his 21 fights in the UFC with victories over current light-heavyweight champion Magomed Ankalaev and former champion Jamahal Hill.

"This sport, the young eat the old and I'm old. Thank you for the memories," said Craig.

Whether Craig won or lost, his record of just two decisions in 29 fights is evidence of his ability to put on entertaining fights - with most of them ending in a stoppage.

He made a name for himself as grappling specialist in the UFC, with his six wins by submission being the second-most in light-heavyweight history behind Glover Teixeira's seven.

After a five-fight win streak between 2019 and 2022, Craig's form dipped and he came into the contest with Lithuanian-Briton Bukauskus with only one victory in eight bouts.

After surviving until the final 10 seconds of the first round, Craig pulled guard and dropped to the ground - a move which proved to be his downfall.

While Craig looked for his signature triangle choke - a move with which he has finished four of his UFC opponents - Bukauskus avoided danger before dealing the knockout blow with only one second remaining.

A bleeding and dazed Craig was seen to by doctors and was consoled by Bukauskus before getting to his feet.

There he removed his gloves, placed them in the middle of the canvas and thanked the crowd for the memories, who responded with a huge round of applause.

Craig is the second major MMA figure in the UK to retire this year, with Molly McCann hanging up her gloves in March.

UFC star Aljamain Sterling said Craig had an "amazing career" in the UFC, while hevyweight champion Tom Aspinall heaped praise on his fellow Briton.

"Special shoutout to Paul Craig on his retirement has done things in his career that the majority dream of," Aspinall said on Instagram.

Full leaderboard

Tommy Fleetwood carded a six-under 64 to open up a four-shot lead before play was suspended in the second round of the St Jude Championship in Memphis due to severe weather.

Having shot 63 in the opening round, the 34-year-old Englishman followed up superbly with seven birdies.

A bogey on the 18th was the only blemish on Fleetwood's total of 13 under as he put himself in a strong position for a first ever PGA Tour victory. 

After hitting a fine 65, two-time major champion Collin Morikawa is at nine under, along with his fellow American Akshay Bhatia in the opening event of the FedExCup play-offs.

England's Justin Rose was on the 17th tee and among 21 players still yet to finish when play was stopped due to lightning. He was also four shots adrift of Fleetwood.

World number one Scottie Scheffler is in the clubhouse at seven under after firing 66.

Englishman Harry Hall's round of 72 left him on four under - a stroke ahead of Scotland's Robert MacIntyre, while 2022 US Open winner Matt Fitzpatrick is at two under after a disappointing 71, which contained five bogeys.

The second round will resume on Saturday at 13:30 BST.

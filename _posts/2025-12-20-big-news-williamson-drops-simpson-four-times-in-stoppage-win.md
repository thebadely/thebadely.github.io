Williamson beats Simpson after four knockdowns in Leeds

Troy Williamson upset the odds and the Leeds crowd to stop Callum Simpson in brilliant fashion and win the British, Commonwealth and European super-middleweight titles.

Simpson was the home hero at the First Direct Bank Arena on Saturday but was on the back foot for much of the fight, struggling to deal with the smaller man's overhand right hands.

The pressure told in the 10th round as Simpson was repeatedly knocked down and forced to defend the onslaught without a mouthguard.

The referee stopped the contest after the fourth knockdown and a jubilant Williamson claimed Simpson's belts.

"Nobody believes in me more than myself. This is my weight division and I showed it tonight," Williamson said.

"This is deep. I carry this piece of paper with me every single day in my car and I read it to myself four or five times a day. I put it in my sock tonight.

"I signed it on 28 October and it says 'I will become British, Commonwealth and European champion on 20 December. I will knock out Callum Simpson'.

"Tonight, you have got yourself a new champion."

Relive Williamson's big knockout of Simpson in Leeds

Britain's Azim headlines on BBC Two on 31 January

Williamson, 34, becomes a two-weight British champion having also won the belt at light-middleweight - and put a torrid run of results behind him after three losses in his past five fights.

Simpson, meanwhile, fell to his first professional defeat in 19 fights and after being serenaded with "Yorkshire, Yorkshire, Yorkshire" chants by a raucous crowd for most of the night, quickly jumped on the microphone to quell potential trouble in the audience.

The Barnsley native sells most of his tickets personally among his fans and paid tribute to them after the loss.

Simpson was ahead on the judges' scorecards when he was stopped in the 10th.

"I thought I was winning most of the rounds. It was always going to be a tough fight with Troy and I got caught with a very good shot," he said.

"I want to say thank you to everyone who turned out tonight and is still here now.

"I have just been put down and everyone is still here, cheering my name. I will not forget that.

"We've got a rematch. I will get back to work, come back and correct this. Thank you for sticking with me. I will be back."

A rematch could be on the cards in 2026 and Williamson said he welcomed "all comers" in the new year.

"This one is for my baby boy at home," Williamson said.

"He comes up to me every single day and says 'and the new...' I don't even have to tell him.

"I promised him I was bringing the belts back to him in the hotel tonight and I am absolutely over the moon."

Williamson added: "This fight has changed my life. I have always wanted my children to have a better upbringing than I had. 

"I deserve that tonight with a performance of a lifetime. I have changed mine and my kids' lives for the better."

Williamson now has back-to-back stoppage wins

Williamson's family was affected by Hurricane Melissa in Jamaica with his father's business wiped out 

On a night where it was announced Adam Azim would headline on BBC Two on 31 January in London against Argentina's Gustavo Lemos, Ben Shalom named the three fights he wants to make in 2026.

The new year brings new opportunities and Boxxer promoter Shalom is targeting three huge match-ups before the end of the year.

Shalom wants to match light-welterweight Azim with British rival Dalton Smith. 

The Sheffield fighter challenges for his maiden world title at the end of January and has long been linked with a fight with Azim.

Shalom also wants to see Chris Eubank Jr step in the ring with Mexican legend Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez and Welsh star Lauren Price take on three-weight undisputed champion Claressa Shields.

Both Shields and Price are undefeated, with Price a unified champion at welterweight and American Shields currently campaigning at heavyweight, although she has won world titles in five different categories.

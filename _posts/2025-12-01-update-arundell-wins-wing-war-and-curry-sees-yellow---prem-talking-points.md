Here’s what you need to know: Henry Arundell, Tom Curry and Benhard Janse van Rensburg were under the spotlight as the Prem returned after the autumn internationals 

The Prem returned after the autumn international break with a headline contest - Saracens v Bath - but the undercard battle out wide was an intriguing subplot.

Henry Arundell and Noah Caluori, blurring foot speed versus pogo-ing aerial spring, is a box office draw.

Caluori was more prominent early on. His first touch of the ball was in the second minute, a towering claim of a Ben Spencer box-kick. Sixty seconds later, in the build-up to Max Malins' early try, Caluori tapped back an Owen Farrell cross kick over Arundell's head.

Saracens directed another three kicks, and plenty of passes, his way inside the first 10 minutes. The 19-year-old soared to reclaim the restart after Finn Russell had posted Bath's first points from a penalty.

But after that early barrage Arundell, like his team, emerged victorious.

Bath go top with thrilling late win at Saracens

Two pacey finishes - the first an 80m interception, the second the match-winner - took him to six tries in six games, while a clever chip kick helped set up impressive number eight Arthur Green's score.

But just as important to Johann van Graan, who compared Arundell's top-end speed to Springbok great Bryan Habana, was the lesser-seen stuff.

Arundell has made more metres (548) and line breaks (16) than any other player in the Prem so far this season. He is also joint second for defenders beaten (25).

"The main things for a winger is always finishes and he can finish - Henry has out-and-out speed," the Bath coach told TNT Sports.

"But he has worked on his defence both at Bath and with England. We spoke about his aerial work and he has worked so hard on his contact skills, that is the sign of a player who wants to improve.

"He is hungry to play for us and he is hungry to play for his country."

A 14-minute cameo against Fiji will have done little to sate that appetite over the autumn. Wing is a congested position in Steve Borthwick's England squad, but Arundell is edging his way up the queue.

Curry's early hit on Josh Hodge was punished with a yellow card

If Arundell will have wished for more of the international spotlight, Tom Curry could probably have done with a bit less of it.

The England flanker was at the centre of an Anglo-Argentine contretemps last weekend after Juan Cruz Mallia was injured in a tackle, with the Pumas demanding an investigation into Curry's alleged push on head coach Felipe Contepomi in the tunnel.

But, just five minutes into Sale's Friday night meeting with Exeter, Curry steamed into a collision with Josh Hodge, bringing the Chiefs full-back to a hard stop.

Coming from a long way, with a clear view of Hodge, Curry didn't dip much, wrapped his arms even less, and saw yellow.

Exeter go top with late comeback win at Sale

That upright hit, off a full run-up and right on the limit of legality, has become something of a Curry trademark.

In the summer, playing for the Lions, he caught Tom Lynagh with one., external This autumn, another Australia 10 - Tane Edmed - was on the receiving end., external The Malia shot was similar.

When it works, the energy, aggression and commitment become the centrepiece of a coach's team talk.

When it doesn't, Curry places his fate in the referee's hands.

Fine margins. Risk and reward. But a reputation for such incidents might weigh the scales more towards the former.

Van Rensburg has been in the Prem team of the season for the past two campaigns

The Ashton Gate MC was just preparing to announce Benhard Janse van Rensburg as the man of the match when the Bristol centre dropped deep and wide out of the backline and rifled a superb 50:22 to within five metres of Northampton's line., external

Case closed.

As well as that exquisite bit of football, Janse van Rensburg won five turnovers, provided 21 metres of territory off seven carries and put in nine tackles, none more effective than the one that set up the bonus-point clinching try.

Northampton fly-half Fin Smith set off on a run-around line around Rory Hutchison but Janse van Rensburg read it like a billboard, munching Smith, dislodging the ball and sending Kalaveti Ravouvou scampering under the posts., external

Six-try Bristol end Northampton's unbeaten start

Janse van Rensburg, born and raised in South Africa, will become eligible for England on residency grounds next year after World Rugby ruled an under-20s appearance for the Baby Boks doesn't tie him to their senior cousins.

It was a timely reminder that they are few midfielders in the top flight with as complete a game.

Ben Redshaw scored his first Prem tries for Gloucester after a summer move from Newcastle

In a recent YouTube video, Gloucester's Jamal Ford-Robinson and Lewis Ludlow circled the Kingsholm car park, reviewing and rating their team-mates' cars., external

Arthur Clark's recent upgrade to an Audi was put down to the match fees the second row had picked up on England duty in the summer.

"This is what a little stint wearing the badge gets you," said Ford-Robinson.

West Country car dealerships should be on alert.  

Gloucester have a clutch of backline youngsters with the time, promise and paperwork to be picking up Test pay packets.

Seb Atkinson, making his comeback from an injury that ruled him out of the autumn internationals, combines with Will Joseph, who won his one England cap as a teenager in 2022, in a well-balanced centre combination.

Resurgent Gloucester beat Quins for first win

Ben Redshaw, brought in from Newcastle in the summer, is an age-grade regular for England and the 20-year-old cut Harlequins to shreds with a brilliant 11th-minute try.

Both Charlie Atkinson, who played 10 for England A in their two matches last month, and rapid teenager Jack Cotgreave came on late on in Saturday's 26-15 win.

With the likes of Clark, Afolabi Fasogbon and Jack Clement up front, there is the basis of an exciting young England side to play George Skivington's expansive style.

Despite sitting ninth in the table, Gloucester rank third for visits to the opposition  22 and fourth for defenders beaten.

However, word out of Wales, external that electric scrum-half Tomos Williams is set to head to Saracens when his contract expires at the end of the season is a blow that will take all that youthful bounce to recover from.

The arrival of Red Bull as club owners have bumped attendances at Kingston Park, if not results

The Red Bull revolution is still awaiting it's first Prem win.

However, another 10,000-plus sell-out crowd saw them push Leicester and perhaps edge closer to a top-flight victory which has eluded them for more than a year.

Leicester replacement James O'Connor's delicious one-hand offload to free Ollie Hassell-Collins and set up Joaquin Moro's second try was something showy to appreciate in the meantime.

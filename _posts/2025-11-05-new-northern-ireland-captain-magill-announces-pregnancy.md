Let's dive into the details: Simone Magill has won 95 caps for Northern Ireland and was named captain in October 2024

Northern Ireland captain and Birmingham City striker Simone Magill has announced she is pregnant.

The 31-year-old shared the news with her Birmingham team-mates on Wednesday and announced it on social media along with her husband, Mark.

"Something tells me next year is going to be the best one yet," Magill posted on Instagram.

Magill will not feature for Birmingham for the rest of the season or for Northern Ireland in the 2027 World Cup qualifiers, which begin in March.

WSL2 club Birmingham City say Magill will continue "light training" with the team and that the club's medical and performance staff will support her "throughout her pregnancy and beyond".

Amy Merricks, Magill's head coach at Birmingham, said she would "make an amazing parent".

"We're looking forward to supporting her on this journey through her pregnancy and as her baby comes into the world, we're excited to have a Bluenose baby," Merricks said.

"We want to keep Si in and around the environment as much as possible. 

"She wants to remain sharp and play a critical part in this season and we're looking forward to supporting her with her journey."

Magill missed Northern Ireland's Nations League play-off defeat by Iceland at the end of October and last played for Birmingham in September because of a hip issue.

She won the first of her 95 NI caps as a teenager in 2010 and was named captain by Tanya Oxtoby in October 2024.

Magill played a key role in Northern Ireland's qualification for Euro 2022 - her country's first major tournament - but sustained a knee injury in the first match against Norway.

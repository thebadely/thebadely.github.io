In 2013, the late Terry Yorath spoke to BBC Wales Sport before the League Cup final between Swansea City and Bradford City, teams he had managed.

Yorath talked about the shocking experience of being player-coach at Bradford on the day of the Valley Parade stadium fire in 1985, when 56 fans died.

He also spoke about the grief suffered by his family seven years later when his son Daniel collapsed and died because of a genetic heart condition, aged 15.

Yorath died in January 2026 after a short illness.

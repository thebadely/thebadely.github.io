Scheffler 'masterclass' seals Open title

Scottie Scheffler says he is "living out his dreams" after winning the Open Championship at Royal Portrush, but reiterated in his moment of triumph there is "more to life than playing golf".

The American anesthetised his rivals on the final day in Northern Ireland, with a composed exhibition of front-running to maintain his overnight four-shot lead. 

The 29-year-old world number one has now won four majors in three years, as well as an Olympic gold medal, and needs just the US Open to become one of seven men to complete a career Grand Slam.

However, he started this week by questioning why he even plays a sport that has earned him Â£65m in prize money alone.

'What's the point?' - Scheffler's daily golfing wrestle

The Englishman who turned around Scheffler's putting fortunes

Scheffler said on Tuesday it was "not a fulfilling life" and the zealous pursuit of wins is "something I wrestle with on a daily basis".

Speaking in the aftermath of his Open success, he conceded that he perhaps did not make his point as well as he had hoped, but stood by his sentiments.

"We live in a day and age where clickbait is what people look for and you can shorten a five-minute clip into three words," admitted Scheffler. "I think it underestimates what I was trying to communicate. 

"I've worked my entire life to become good at this game and play for a living. It's one of the great joys of my life and to win The Open is a feeling that's hard to describe.

"Am I grateful for it? Do I enjoy it? Oh, my gosh, yes, this is a cool feeling. But having success in life is not what fulfils the deepest desires of your heart. 

"Just because you win a golf tournament doesn't make you happy - but I'm pretty excited to celebrate this one."

'Special moment' - Scheffler wins The Open

Scheffler said he intends to leave for home in Texas later on Sunday and "celebrate with the people that have helped me along the way".

After he tapped in on the 18th an hour or so earlier - and the crowds offered their throaty approval - the first person he looked for was wife Meredith.

Belatedly spotting her, and 14-month-old son Bennett, who was toddling on to the green, Scheffler's typically muted response changed. 

He hurled his hat into the sky, roared with delight, and lumbered with arms outstretched towards them.

The trio embraced before Scheffler retrieved his hat and left the green with a bemused Bennett nestled in the crook of his left arm.

"When I saw my family, that was a pretty special feeling," said Scheffler, who insisted earlier in the week that he would quit golf if it started to impact upon his family.

"It's one that's very hard to describe. It's something I'm very grateful for and something that I'll hold on to for a long time."

Experts revealed that Ask a fan of any team in Scotland who they want their club to sign before Monday's transfer deadline and there will be one name which sticks out.

Tawanda Maswanhise.

With 18 goals in all competitions, it is no surprise there are clubs rumoured to be circling like sharks in the water around the Motherwell forward. 

The Zimbabwe rising star has been a revelation so far this season, currently standing alone as the league's top scorer with Jens Berthel Askou's side trailing Celtic by just two points.

At just 23 years old, his good years are ahead of him and Motherwell are in no mood to sell, with Maswanhise contracted until 2027. The club also hold an option for a further year.

"We have a game on Wednesday [against Dundee] and the business we plan to do doesn't really involve him," Askou said after Maswanhise's double secured a 2-0 win over Livingston.

"I never said he wasn't for sale, but I said we don't have a plan to sell him now."

But how long can Motherwell hold on to their star man? How much would force their hand, and could a big fish be tempted to meet that demand?

Kieron Bowie's exit from Hibs was confirmed last week, with the young Scotland cap joining Hellas Verona in Italy's Serie A.

It took a reported Â£6m fee, external to shift him from Leith, with more money flowing to Easter Road in potential add-ons, but Bowie's numbers pale in comparison to Maswanhise.

"If  Bowie, with nine goals, is going for Â£6m, there's no way Motherwell will say 'we'll accept Â£2.5m-Â£3m'," former Motherwell captain Stephen Craigan said. "Not a chance in a million years.

"He can play wide, he can play centre-forward. And what he's shown is that he can score all types of goals. That'll be the gauge, somewhere close to that [Â£6m mark], if someone wants to pinch him before the window shuts."

Craigan also explained there are other circumstances which suggest Motherwell's hand will not be forced in the coming days when it comes to their in-demand striker.

"There's a couple of things as well," he said. "The Lennon Miller [who was sold to Udinese in the summer] money, there's still a good chunk of that there. If he makes progress, they get more.

"Crowds at Fir Park are up by 1,500-2,000 at home. There's plenty of money sitting about, Motherwell aren't desperate to sell their prized asset.

"There's more benefits to keeping Maswanhise until the summer. If everything progresses as it has been, his value goes up more."

'Maswanhise's time to leave is not now' - Askou

Motherwell fans will be cursing any chat linking Maswanhise away from Fir Park. It is believed no formal bids have been tabled, but he is the name which continuously gets talked about.

Where would Maswanhise go, though? Championship strugglers Blackburn Rovers have been touted, while plenty of pundits have suggested both sides of the Old Firm should take a look at the Zimbabwe international.

Chat around how he could add a dynamic edge to Celtic's misfiring attack has grown on message boards, social feeds and across the media landscape. Especially given his dynamism and ability to play centrally or cut in from out wide.

However, even if Scotland's two biggest clubs came sniffing around, former Rangers striker Rory Loy is not convinced Motherwell would be moved.

"If Maswanhise had scored that amount of goals in the Austrian league, a young player with a couple of assists as well, you'd look at it and go that's a great bit of business [for the Old Firm]," Loy said.

"In the past, Celtic and Rangers could put bids in and Motherwell couldn't refuse them. But the difference this time is Motherwell can get into Europe, and that could make a big difference financially, so they might want to hold on to Maswanhise."

Plundering Motherwell for a forward has worked before for Celtic - think of Scott McDonald's time in Glasgow, scoring 64 goals in 128 games which included a winner against AC Milan. Albeit that was some time ago now.

However, it does not always work. Jake Hastie never made a league appearance for Rangers, while David Turnbull's time at Celtic on the back of a Â£3.25 move ended after struggling for game time.

Wherever he goes, it will be fascinating to see what Maswanhise turns up. He scored just six goals in his debut season at Motherwell following his switch from Leicester City, and was in and out of the team under previous boss Michael Wimmer.

But with the guidance of Askou, it has been a different story. His 13 goals in the league make him more prolific than anyone else in Scotland's topflight, but he is outperforming his expected goals (xG) by 6.5 goals.

He also was named as one of the three most promising talents at the Africa Cup of Nations after shining brightly for Zimbabwe.

Is it the case that this is a purple patch? Has he become a clinical finisher over the summer? Or is he benefiting from Askou's coaching, as are the likes of Elliot Watt, Callum Slattery, and previous loanee Stephen Welsh? A rising tide lifts all boats, after all.

The fact he stood out so much for his nation in Morocco despite not getting much game time would suggest not.

Regardless, the fact remains Maswanhise is Scotland's hottest ticket. What the value is of that ticket, Motherwell fans will be hoping we do not find out any time soon.

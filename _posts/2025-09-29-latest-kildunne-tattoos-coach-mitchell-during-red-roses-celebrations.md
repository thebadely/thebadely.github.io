Experts revealed that Mitchell and Kildunne show off his new body art

Head coach John Mitchell has a permanent and personal memento of England's Rugby World Cup victory after star full-back Ellie Kildunne gave him a celebratory tattoo.

Kildunne fired up a tattoo gun and adorned the inside of 61-year-old Mitchell's wrist with an equals sign and '2025' in honour of their victory over Canada in Saturday's final.

In the dressing room after the final, prop Hannah Botterman had similarly updated the sleeve of her playing shirt, scrawling 2025 below 1994 and 2014 â the dates of England's previous two Rugby World Cup victories â on the sleeve.

Captain Zoe Aldcroft and scrum-half Natasha Hunt broke a self-imposed 13-month alcohol ban in the aftermath of victory, necking some iced cider before the team returned to the Allianz Stadium pitch and celebrated in front of the empty stands.

Their on-pitch celebrations included a rendition of the squad's reworked version of Gala's megahit Freed from Desire, which included the lyrics England's on fire/Watch our back three come alive/England's on fire/Then our forwards gonna drive/England's on fire/coming at us, it's suicide.

England's celebrations then moved on to a private party at the nearby Cabbage Patch pub, which has been renamed as the Red Roses Patch for the duration of the tournament.

Friends and family were joined by former Red Roses with Katy Daley-McLean, Kat Merchant, Claire Allen and Danielle Waterman, all part of the team when England last won the trophy in 2014, leading singalongs from the pub stage.

American Ilona Maher, a social media phenomenon who spent three months with Bristol Bears earlier this year, was part of a nearby party and celebrated with her former Bears team-mates Botterman, Sarah Bern and Abbie Ward.

While Mitchell headed back to the team hotel at 01:30am, Aldcroft led from the front as part of the final group to return, along with Botterman, Hunt, Emily Scarratt and Mackenzie Carson, at 6:30am.

Aldcroft had just 75 minutes sleep before her alarm went off for a day of media and a public celebration event in Battersea.

Prop Sarah Bern told Rugby Union Weekly that there is a tentative plan for the squad to head to Ibiza together before they return to their PWR clubs ahead of the start of the new season at the end of next month.

"If anyone wants to host the 32 of us, we would love to go!" she said.

Asked what her message was to any young fan considering starting to play rugby after seeing the Red Roses success, an emotional Bern was adamant.

"Just go ahead and do it," she said.

"I am a big believer that sometime in the world you don't feel you fit in, but rugby is that place.

"You can fit in if you are tall, short, fast, strong, powerful. No matter what might be separating you from the world, that is where you are going to be included - in rugby.

"I was dyslexic and shy and I didn't excel in traditional classrooms. I was really bright but couldn't do the exams. Sport and rugby gave me my whole life and confidence to create the person that I am now.

"If we can share that with other people in the world then that's all we want to do.

"Get stuck into rugby because honestly you have never had so much fun as you will have had with rugby people. Everyone is welcome in this sport."

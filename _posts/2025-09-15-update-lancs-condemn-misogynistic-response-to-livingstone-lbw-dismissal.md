It has been recently reported that Liam Livingstone was dismissed for 29 as Lancashire lost their T20 Blast semi-final against Somerset

Lancashire have condemned "misogynistic comments" on social media that followed Liam Livingstone's controversial dismissal in the semi-final defeat by Somerset at the T20 Vitality Blast Finals Day.

Livingstone was given out lbw by on-field umpire James Middlebrook, with the decision backed up by third umpire Sue Redfern after the England batter sent the incident for review, claiming to have struck the ball with an inside edge.

A number of comments on social media criticised Redfern's verdict and questioned why a woman should be third umpire for a men's match.

"While the club remains deeply frustrated and disappointed with the decision, Lancashire is equally clear that it does not condone the misogynistic comments that have appeared across social media in response," the club said in a statement on X., external

"Such behaviour is unacceptable, does not reflect the values of our club or the wider Red Rose family, and has no place in the game."

In the same statement, Lancashire also said they had submitted a complaint to the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) about the decision which saw Livingstone given out for 29.

The club said they have "formally expressed disappointment" to the governing body.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: The Manchester synagogue attacker was repeatedly shot after running "aggressively" towards armed police while carrying a knife and wearing what appeared to be a suicide belt, an inquest has heard.

Jihad Al-Shamie, 35, was shot minutes after launching his car and knife attack on Heaton Park synagogue in the city's Crumpsall area on 2 October.

Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66, were killed, while another three men were hospitalised. 

Members of Al-Shamie's family attended the hearing via videolink as the inquest was opened and adjourned at Manchester Coroner's Court earlier.

The court heard Al-Shamie was identified at the scene by fingerprints and "secondary evidence" at the scene, including his mobile phone and car.

Inquests into the two victims, which opened on Wednesday, heard Mr Cravitz was stabbed while Mr Daulby died from a gunshot wound to the chest fired by police.

Al-Shamie, a Syrian-born UK citizen, began his rampage by driving his Kia Picanto at security staff and the external gates of the synagogue as worshippers were gathering for Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the year for Jews.

CCTV footage from the scene showed Al-Shamie driving his car into the gates and external wall of the synagogue at 09:30 BST, striking a security guard, before attacking worshippers and security guards with a knife.

He then tried to storm the synagogue, wearing a fake suicide belt, before being shot dead.

Det Ch Supt Lewis Hughes told the hearing that armed officers responding to the call "discharged several rounds" at Al-Shamie as "he ran towards them aggressively while carrying a knife and wearing what clearly presented as a suicide belt".

He added: "Al-Shamie sustained multiple bullet wounds and collapsed to the ground."

Al-Shamie wasn't pronounced dead until 16:38 BST because of concerns about the belt on his body, the inquest heard.

Det Ch Supt Hughes continued: "Three other victims were very seriously injured, which consisted of a security guard struck by the vehicle, a worshipper completing security duties, outside, who was stabbed, and another worshipper, inside, who also sustained a gunshot injury.

"Whilst all received very serious injuries requiring extensive medical treatment, all are recovering and it is not anticipated that there will be any further loss of life arising from this incident."

The hearing was also attended by representatives from Greater Manchester Police, the government's legal department, Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, the Independent Office for Police Conduct and Counter Terrorism Policing North West.

Judge Alexia Durran, chief coroner of England and Wales, released Al Shamie's body to his family for burial.

She said it was "not the day to test or ask questions of [Det Ch Supt Hughes] about his evidence". 

"There will be time at the inquest hearing to do so," she said. 

Judge Durran adjourned the inquest until February 19, when a pre-inquest review will be held.

According to new developments, Fraser Dingwall and Tommy Freeman have started alongside each other as England's centres in wins over Wales and Australia

It is not a skill listed on many players' CVs.

But Tommy Freeman, with a smile, gladly attributes it to team-mate Fraser Dingwall.

"He kind of gets nailed to put me in a hole â he's very good at that," Freeman tells Rugby Union Weekly.

"Sacrificing himself for the greater good!"

When Dingwall grafts, Freeman thrives. 

As England's starting centre combination, the pair will try to pull off their bait-and-switch special against Wales on Saturday, with Dingwall taking the ball to the line and Freeman taking the glory.

They have been England's 12-13 partnership only twice previously. Freeman is a relative midfield rookie, having spent the vast majority of his career on the wing.

But the pair have a shared history to draw from.

Both came through the Northampton academy and were key figures in Saints' run to the Premiership title in 2023-24 and a Champions Cup final in 2024-25.

"It's very easy to call each other out and tell each other when we're not going so well. And when we are," says Freeman.

"That's massive because the more times you're in that position [alongside each other], the more cues you're picking up.

"Dingers is an awesome communicator. It's just constant, constant noise.

"He's just very good at seeing what's in front and giving you confidence and he can move the ball very well and create some good opportunities for us outside boys."

Dingwall does more than grease wheels, spot space and take shots though. 

In a rare win over New Zealand in the autumn, it was him arcing in under the posts as Ollie Lawrence drew attention and shifted the ball at the last moment.

But, for the most part, he is happy to lean into reputation as a player who makes others shine, rather than living in the spotlight himself.

"You look at the people that we have in the backline, their natural talent around beating people, physicality and all the kind of stuff that they can do - I just feel like my role is a bit how I can bring that out as best as possible," Dingwall said.

"That's not to say that I don't try and better myself constantly and am not trying to become one of these people or do those things.

"But we've got such talent and super strengths within this backs division, it's like: 'How can I aid bringing all of that out?'"

With Freeman, sometimes that involves a gentle reminder that as well as speed, the 24-year-old, who stands 6ft 3in and weighs 16st 3lbs, can use his heft to rattle defences.

Watching back training footage recently, Freeman was surprised by the sight of himself in flight, powerful as well as quick.

"'Am I actually that big?' - those were his actual words," remembered Dingwall.

"He forgets how big he is half the time.

"It's crazy you have to keep saying to him - you're quite a big guy and encourage him to just bring out those attributes, to take people on or go and be physically dominant in contact."

Freeman puts his underappreciation of his own physicality down to being a younger brother to two bigger boys - and a laid-back mindset.

Dingwall will be a constant reminder that he has all the attributes to take route one at Allianz Stadium on Saturday.

Opposite them, the red shirts of Wales will flutter like matador capes.

Freeman barged through some flimsy tackling to score in a 68-14 victory in Cardiff in last year's Six Nations.

As he wagged his finger in celebration at the Principality Stadium stands, Dingwall - having combined with fellow Saint Fin Smith, to fizz the ball wide to seize the space - was already jogging back towards halfway.

England hope that their partnership of contrasting gifts will keep on giving.

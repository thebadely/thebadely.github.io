It has been recently reported that This Diwali, Jamavar Dubai and Good Earth India unite for A Feast in Chahar Bagh, a dazzling collaboration that transforms the MICHELIN-starred restaurant into an enchanting garden of light and abundance. Running from October 16 to 26, the experience reimagines the fabled Chahar Bagh through Good Earth’s exquisite florals, layered tablescapes, and 24-carat accented serveware, creating a dining setting steeped in artistry and heritage. Culinary Director and Executive Chef Surender Mohan curates a four-course tasting menu that pays homage to India’s festive richness, featuring dishes like the delicate Khasta Kachori and the signature Gajrela. A sensory celebration of design, flavour, and tradition, A Feast in Chahar Bagh invites guests to experience Diwali through the lens of refined Indian luxury in the heart of Downtown Dubai.

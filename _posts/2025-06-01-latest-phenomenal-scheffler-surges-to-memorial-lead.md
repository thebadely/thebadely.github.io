Full leaderboard

World number one Scottie Scheffler stormed to the top of the leaderboard with a four-under-par 68 in a "challenging"  third round of the Memorial Tournament in Columbus, Ohio.

The 28-year-old American continued his impressive run of form to go one shot ahead of compatriot Ben Griffin, whom he had trailed by three going into the day.

Scheffler is searching for a third victory from his latest four tournaments and went bogey free on Saturday, making pars on the first 13 holes before finishing in style with birdies at 14, 15, 17 and 18.

That surge gave him the lead on eight under overall.

Griffin had five birdies and five bogeys in his level-par 72.

Canada's Nick Taylor carded a two-over 74 and is three shots off the lead, while Ireland's Shane Lowry has a share of seventh place after a one-over 73.

Scheffler said of his low-scoring round: "I was definitely proud of the way I finished, and it was really challenging.

"Around this golf course, even par, I think, today would have been a pretty solid score.

"I felt like I could have got a little bit more out of the round, but I felt like I was playing nice and just a couple lips here and there would have changed the score a little bit."

Taylor said of the challenge of competing against Scheffler for the title on Sunday: "I'll be trying to chase him down.

"He's obviously playing phenomenal, so I'll have to play some of my best golf to be in the hunt there with the last few holes to go."

'Scheffler's Woods-like mentality should worry chasing pack'

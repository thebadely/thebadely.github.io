It has been recently reported that Stephen Lawrence's father says one of his son's murderers should name the other killers before he can be judged to be safe for release from prison.

David Norris will bid to be released on licence during a public Parole Board hearing on Tuesday, 13 years after being handed a life sentence. 

Only two of the men - Norris and Gary Dobson - who were involved in the racist stabbing of the 18-year-old in Eltham, south London, in April 1993 have ever been brought to justice, with four other suspects never convicted.

His father Dr Neville Lawrence told BBC News: "For me to think that [Norris is] safe to be released, is for him to give the names of the people with him that night."

Police have always believed there were six attackers, as Stephen's friend Duwayne Brooks - who saw the attack - said on the night.

Three of the original prime suspects - brothers Neil and Jamie Acourt, and Luke Knight - have never been convicted and remain free.

A sixth suspect, Matthew White - who was first publicly named by the BBC two years ago - died in 2021 aged 50.

For decades Norris publicly denied involvement in the murder, giving no-comment interviews to police, and claiming he was innocent during his trial.

However, it emerged earlier this year that he had admitted involvement while in prison, telling staff that he had been present, and had hit Stephen but had not stabbed him.

Norris's admission has created an extraordinary situation: he is seeking to be released from a prison sentence for a crime he admits carrying out, while most of those responsible have never been held to account.

Stephen's father told the BBC that Norris should now have to identify the other killers if he was to be considered for release. 

He said: "I wouldn't think that he's generally changed his behaviour and mind, if he doesn't name all the others that was with him."

Dr Lawrence said he also wanted to know if Norris remained racist, saying that if he had not changed then he "shouldn't be out in the public because that means another family is in danger of losing one of their loved ones".

After Stephen was murdered, police secretly filmed Norris expressing violent racist fantasies, saying he wanted to torture black people.

Dr Lawrence said he thought it was "essential" to hear Norris's views about "how he feels about people of different colours and race, and if he is still having that hatred for people from other countries".

If he could ask Norris questions directly, Dr Lawrence says he would ask: "Are you regretting some of the things that you said, and are you actually a changed person?"

He continued: "My life has been turned upside down by these boys, young fellas, who went out on the street looking for somebody to kill. Unfortunately, Stephen was in their sight."

Over three days this week the Parole Board will listen to evidence about Norris, before deciding whether he is safe to be released on licence.

Norris is expected to give evidence on Tuesday and may read a statement about the murder.

The Parole Board will hear evidence from prison staff who have dealt with Norris, and psychologists who have assessed him, as well as impact statements read on behalf of Stephen's family. 

Few parole hearings have been heard in public since the law changed two years ago. 

The Met Police ended its murder investigation in 2020, but a BBC investigation has led to an independent review of the case, which began last month.

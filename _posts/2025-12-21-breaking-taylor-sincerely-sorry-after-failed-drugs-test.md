Experts revealed that Dom Taylor was ranked 65th in the world at the start of the tournament.

Dom Taylor says he is "sincerely sorry" after a failed drugs test meant he was excluded from the PDC World Darts Championship.

Englishman Taylor, who beat Oskar Lukasiak in the first round at Alexandra Palace, was tested in line with "ongoing anti-doping procedures", the Darts Regulation Authority said on Friday.

Taylor said he apologises for "blatant lying" and that he will be "back to prove himself".

The 27-year-old said his mental health had been affected by a series of personal traumas, including the anniversary of his daughter's death.

He was given a one-month suspension in January after failing a drugs test during the previous year.

After defeating Lukasiak, Taylor said he had "rebounded back" and described the earlier suspension as "the biggest let down of my life".

On Facebook, Taylor wrote: "I need to apologise for blatant lying to you all in my interview after my win against Oskar last week, as I have been lying to myself and everyone else around me.

"I did complete and finish the course that I was required to do at the end of last/beginning of this year, along with everything else I was required to do and sanctions."

A potential two-year ban was reduced after he proved the substance was not performance-enhancing and was taken outside of competition, while also committing to completing a three-month treatment programme approved by UK Anti-Doping.

Taylor had been due to play Jonny Clayton in the second round, with Clayton receiving a bye to the third round following Taylor's suspension.

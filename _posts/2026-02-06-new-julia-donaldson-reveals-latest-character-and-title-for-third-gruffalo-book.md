Here’s what you need to know: Children's author Julia Donaldson has revealed the new title and lead character of her much-anticipated new Gruffalo book. 

Gruffalo Granny - the third in the popular series about the fictional monster and his family and friends - will be released in hardback and audio book on 10 September.

Twenty years in the making, it will see the introduction of the new family member, while old favourites from the first two books will also return for "an exciting new adventure", publisher Macmillan said.

The announcement was made on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday. Donaldson - who creates the stories alongside illustrator Axel Scheffler - said: "It's always a challenge to write a sequel".

A picture of the new character, released later on Friday, shows her carrying a handbag, notebook and pencil.

"I've had this idea for the best part of two decades, but I've just been so busy writing other things," Donaldson told Today. "And now of course I'm a granny myself, so maybe that's what spurred me on."

Axel Scheffler added: "I've been saying for more than 20 years there won't be a sequel, and it's taught me to never say never. 

"It was a complete surprise for me, but Julia came up with such a wonderful story and I got very excited about it."

The Gruffalo was first published in 1999, with its follow-up, The Gruffalo's Child, following five years later. 

Both books tell a tale about an adventure in a woodland full of animals, with the story told in rhyming couplets.

The first two books have sold more than 18 million copies in 115 languages and dialects around the world.

In a statement announcing the book, Donaldson explained: "I actually had the basic idea for the story a long time ago, but couldn't think how to develop it.

"It was only when the National Literacy Trust, whose work I'm very impressed by, used the first two books as part of their Early Words Matter programme that I was spurred on to get my idea out of the cupboard and see once and for all if I could turn it into a really satisfying story.

"To my surprise, I managed to do just that!"

The London-born author added that she was "of course delighted" when Scheffler came back on board with his "brilliant sketches".

"I really hope that children - and adults too - will enjoy the new story, as I know what a wonderful experience shared reading can be."

In 2009, the original story - about a clever mouse fooling a series of predators while strolling in a deep dark wood - became an Oscar-nominated animated short film on BBC One, with James Corden, Rob Brydon and Helena Bonham Carter providing some of the voices. 

Two years later, The Gruffalo's Child was also animated, earning a Bafta nomination, with Shirley Henderson taking the role of the young monster. 

The third book in the series, which was announced in April last year, will see the return of the fox, snake, owl and of course, the courageous mouse.

The only line from the book which is known so far is:

"The Gruffalo said to his daughter one day, 'Your Gruffalo granny is coming to stay.'"

German animator and illustrator Scheffler admitted he had always, until recently, "denied the possibility of another visit to the deep dark wood".

"Until one day out of the blue there came a wonderfully clever and inspired new text by Julia," he said.

"How does she do this? Could I decline? Of course not!"

He went on to confirm that he had, in fact, "drawn the odd Gruffalo and his daughter over the last 20 years", and was therefore "not completely out of practice" when the new story arrived - in need of illustration.

"I'm also very happy that the Gruffalos will get involved in some charitable activities to reach even more young readers with support from the National Literacy Trust," he added.

Macmillan Children's Books have said they will introduce Gruffalo Granny to the public by projecting images of the new character in locations in both Glasgow and London on Friday evening.

Alison Ruane, the publisher's managing director, stressed that "the impact" the Gruffalo characters have "had on families around the world can not be underestimated".

She added how pleased they were it was being released in the National Year of Reading.

Donaldson and Scheffler's other titles include Room on the Broom, Zog, Stick Man and The Snail and the Whale, Tiddler and A Squash and a Squeeze.

The BBC's biggest Donaldson TV adaptation to date, The Scarecrows' Wedding, aired on Christmas Day 2025, and was viewed by 8.7 million people in total in the first 28 days on both BBC One and iPlayer.

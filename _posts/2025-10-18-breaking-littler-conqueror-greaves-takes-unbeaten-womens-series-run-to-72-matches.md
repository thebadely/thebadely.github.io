Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Beau Greaves is top of the Women's Series rankings

Darts sensation Beau Greaves extended her remarkable winning run in the PDC Women's Series to 72 matches with victory in the latest two tournaments in Wigan on Saturday. 

The 21-year-old from Doncaster announced on Friday that she would compete in the PDC World Championship, days after beating world number one Luke Littler in the World Youth Championship semi-finals. 

Her focus switched back to the women's game this weekend and a run of four tournaments over two days  - two on Saturday and two on Sunday - to bring the PDC Women's Series to a close.

Greaves beat Fallon Sherrock 5-4 in both of Saturday's finals, taking her tally to 11 consecutive tournament wins. 

Saturday's double means she has now won 16 of 22 tournaments in the PDC Women's Series this year.  

The three-time WDF women's world champion will be joined by Sherrock and fellow English player Lisa Ashton in competing at the PDC World Championships, which start at London's Alexandra Palace on 11 December. 

She will also compete in the PDC's Grand Slam in Wolverhampton in early November, before facing defending champion Gian van Veen of the Netherlands in the youth final at Minehead later next month.

The Women's Series concludes in Wigan on Sunday with the final two events of the 24-tournament season.

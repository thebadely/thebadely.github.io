Experts revealed that Governing bodies and leagues have called on the UK government to introduce tax relief for the live broadcast production of women's sports.

Before Wednesday's Budget, the Women's Super League, Premier Women's Rugby, Sky and ITV are among those to have signed a letter to Chancellor Rachel Reeves saying "the time is right to act now".

In the letter, which is also signed by the England and Wales Cricket Board, the Football Association, Rugby Football Union and England Netball, the organisations said the tax relief would "boost participation, create jobs and support growth".

Similar tax relief, known as an expenditure credit, is already in place for some creative industries in the UK and can reduce a company's corporation tax bill.

In the letter, which has been seen by BBC Sport, the organisations say the tax relief would help support new events; increase coverage of underrepresented sports; enhance production quality of broadcasts and help create greater visibility for women's sports.

"We believe this proposed expenditure credit would kickstart this decade of change and have an immediate impact in helping drive the visibility of our amazing sportswomen as well as providing the foundations for long-term growth across women's sports production," the letter states.

"While broadcasters have increased investment and innovation in coverage, there remains an underproduction of programming relative to women's sport's wider economic and societal benefits."

According to new developments, It was the pioneering vision of a Stranraer businessman in 1970 that would go on to produce some of Scotland's most successful curlers on the world stage. 

Hamilton "Hammy" McMillan and his wife Janet, purchased the North West Castle hotel in 1961, and quickly extended the accommodation from 12 bedrooms to 30. 

But it was a savvy business move and a niche addition six years later that saw the creation of the world's first hotel featuring an in-built ice-rink. 

Since opening 56 years ago, Stranraer's ice-rink has made an indelible mark in the world of curling by churning out multiple European, World and Olympic champions. 

Hammy's son - also called Hammy - won five European championships, while Vicky Wright brought home the Olympic gold from Beijing in 2022. 

Now, two of Hammy's grandsons have their sights set on Olympic glory at the winter Milano Cortina games.

Hammy McMillan Jr and his cousin Grant Hardie will join fellow Stranraer local Bobby Lammie as part of Team GB, led by skip Bruce Mouat. 

Gail Munro, the daughter of Hammy Sr, is the youngest of five children. 

She was just four years old when the ice-rink was built and it has played an integral part in her life - she's been the manager for almost 20 years.  

She said it was local curlers who first sparked the idea for a rink, as they were tired of travelling 50 miles to Ayr or, even further, to Glasgow to enjoy their sport. 

As a proud businessman, Hammy was also fed up of seeing the curlers leaving his bar to spend money elsewhere during their competitions. 

''They would say to my dad, 'Hammy, we wouldn't need to go away if you would just build us an ice-rink'. 

''Next thing, my dad had plans submitted and six months later we had an ice rink. Here we are, 56 years later and producing world champions."

From the first foundations being laid in 1819, it seemed that the hotel was destined to become synonymous with ice. 

It was built by the Arctic explorer Rear Admiral Sir John Ross, whose nephew James Clark Ross would later discover the magnetic North Pole. 

But it was 160 years later that the hotel would be put well and truly on the map - this time for curling accolades. 

Success at the 1979 world junior championships was the beginning of Stranraer's long record of producing some of the best curlers in the game. 

''Dad only began curling at the age of 40, yet managed to go on and win the senior Scottish championships," said Gail. 

"Two different teams won world junior championships in 1980 and 1981, so there were eight local curlers at the top of the tree back in the early 80s.

''In 1999 my brother- also called Hammy - won the elusive world championships and the success just seemed to snowball."

Four years ago Team Mouat - featuring Stranraer's McMillan Jr, Hardie and Lammie - just missed out on the gold medal in Beijing, but they are determined to go one better this time round. 

The team is a formidable force, having now clocked up a record breaking 12 grand slams, four European championships and two world championships. They are currently ranked number one in the world.

''We're super excited and the aim is to get the gold," Hammy Jr told BBC Scotland News. 

"It was amazing what mine and Grant's grandfather did, to have the initiative to build a four-sheet ice rink for the community in Stranraer. 

"It's been amazing, and the community that's down there is just fantastic."

The ice-rink has never been used for skating - it is unapologetically committed to serving curlers only. 

However, keeping the hotel a success has not been without its challenges. When the Irish sea ferry terminals in Stranraer were closed in 2011- to be moved six miles along the coast to Cairnryan - visitor numbers in the town dwindled. 

But the owners have capitalised on its unique facilities to entice visitors from all corners of the world.

''For 50 years we have offered weekend competition packages, where you enter a rink and you get thrown into a competition," said Gail.

"You arrive on a Friday night and you have a full board package, your curling is included and we entertain you with a dance on the Saturday night as well. 

''We have anything from 12 to 24 teams taking part almost every weekend throughout our season for 24 weekends, the place is just thriving and buzzing."

Stranraer is one of three towns in south-west Scotland that consistently produce a steady stream of elite curlers. 

There are rinks in Dumfries and Lockerbie which are able to boast an impressive list of past and present champions in both the men's and women's games. 

So why is this region of fewer than 150,000 people responsible for producing 50% of this year's Team GB Olympic curlers? 

Munro believes it is down to accessibility and inspiring the youngsters. 

''People do look up to the curlers," she said. "They are down there on the ice playing club curling as if it's normal, then they go away and the next weekend they're playing at European and World level.'

''One of the professional curlers came back to play a club game last month and one of the young 13-year-old boys was starstruck. 

"Euan Kyle gave him his brush - well that boy couldn't sleep that night, he had to take his brush to bed, it really was lovely."

She added: "They're an inspiration to the next generation coming through.'' 

After more than 50 years, the McMillan family sold the hotel to new owners in 2023, and Munro says they fully support curling in Stranraer. 

The hotel is now gearing up for the beginning of the 2026 games, with the hotel set to host "watch parties" if any of the teams make it to the medal matches. 

Grant Hardie said he was grateful for his grandfather's achievements.

"Unfortunately my grandfather is no longer with us," he said. 

"But the amount of curlers that would go away and have success on the world stage and come back and thank him every time, and you know we're the same. 

"Without him building the ice rink, our parents would never have played it and we would never have got involved. 

''I'm sure him and my granny were very proud to see us doing well on the world stage. It'll be nice to have our granny out there in Cortina supporting us.''

Grant's mum, Fiona Hardie, will be joining the team in Italy, alongside Hammy and Bobby's parents. 

She said she has no doubt that her dad's legacy will be the mark he has left on curling. 

''My dad always encouraged young curlers and he was so proud of his grandsons and granddaughter," she said.

"My mum and dad would go everywhere to watch them and mum is coming out to Cortina with us. Dad would be so proud."

The McMillan family members continue to have a close relationship with the hotel. 

As manager of the ice-rink, Gail's passion lies with ensuring the game continues to  thrive in Stranraer and encourages everyone, of all ages and abilities, to give curling a go.

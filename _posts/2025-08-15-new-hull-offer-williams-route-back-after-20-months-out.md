Here’s what you need to know: Brandon Williams has signed a one-year deal with Championship side Hull City

Hull City have signed former Manchester United full-back Brandon Williams on a one-year contract with an option to extend for another 12 months.

The 24-year-old, who made his debut at United in 2019, has spent 20 months out of football following a loan spell at Ipswich Town during the 2023-24 season.

During that time Williams was sentenced to 14 months in jail, suspended for two years, after being convicted for dangerous driving.

After spending the pre-season training with the Tigers and impressing in home friendlies against Sunderland and Getafe, Williams has been handed a route back in by head coach Sergej Jakirovic.

The full-back said it has been a tough road back to the professional ranks after being out of top-level sport.

"It feels good to be back in the team environment and back on the pitch," he told the Hull City club website, external. "Everyone has been very welcoming. It's been a good few weeks but I'm just happy I'm here now and can focus on the football.

"I had a couple of very honest meetings with the manager. We know it's going to be a process to get fully back up to speed, having that time out. It had been 20 months since I played or was involved with a team.

"I appreciated the manager's honesty. Now, it's down to me to work hard and get as many games as I can."

Williams said he returns to football in a different place from where he left it.

"It was very difficult [taking a break from football] â mentally and physically. It's been a long road back, but probably something I needed. Now, I'm back here a different person," he said.

"I've grown up a lot and I'm ready to just focus on the football. I've missed it. I'm hungry, I'm fiery. I know what quality I can bring to the team. As soon as I get back to that, I'm sure I'll be an asset to the team."

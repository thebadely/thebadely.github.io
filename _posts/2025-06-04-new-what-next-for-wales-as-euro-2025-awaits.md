Here’s what you need to know: Wales record cap holder Jess Fishlock helped stem the tide after a one-sided first half in the 4-1 loss to Italy

It was hardly the ideal send-off.

In what was Wales' final game before their first appearance at a major finals, Rhian Wilkinson's history-makers had a painful reminder of how tough it can be at the top level with a 4-1 Nations League defeat against Italy.

But a spirited second-half reaction in Swansea, a stunning Jess Fishlock goal and the self-awareness of head coach Wilkinson means that Wales will not dwell too long.

After all, with little less than a month to go before their opening game against the Netherlands in Lucerne on 5 July, they do not have the time.

But what lies in store for Wales between now and their European Championships bow?

And what happens next for the women in red before it all gets under way in Switzerland?

Wales must learn from painful defeat - Wilkinson

Wales suffer big loss to Italy as Euro 2025 looms

Highlights: Wales 1-4 Italy

Wilkinson and her fellow coaches will waste little time in analysing their final Nations League results, Wales having lost controversially in Denmark last week before the shocker against the Italians in Swansea.

A camp debrief is planned in the next few days, not just looking back at the tactical aspects but the logistical too.

Conversations with fellow staff and â in some cases â players will follow as Wales look to learn lessons and move on quickly.

Updates will also be required on some of the injuries suffered during the week. Rhiannon Roberts is thought to have picked up a groin problem on the eve of the game in Odense, but the noises are positive the centre-back will be fit for Switzerland.

Wales will also await results of a scan on exciting 18-year-old defender Mayzee Davies who suffered a suspected knee injury early in the 1-0 defeat to Denmark, with concern over the extent understandable.

Jess Fishlock tells the story of the rise of Wales' women's side

Having gained vital minutes following a two-month injury lay-off â not to mention her wonder goal - Fishlock will now return to the United States and club side Seattle Reign, as will captain Angharad James. 

The National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) side have three fixtures before the division breaks for the summer, with the 38-year-old Fishlock able to get further into her inspirational stride before Switzerland.

Meanwhile, back in south Wales, the Football Association of Wales (FAW) will open the doors to its training base in the Vale of Glamorgan for domestic players for two optional training camps.

Starting next week, with another the following week, players will be offered training days with coaches should they feel the need.

It is not a necessity, with some players recognised as needing downtime rather than more workload, and some who have featured less regularly eager for extra sessions. Conversations between individuals and coaching staff will help form the decisions.

Kayleigh Barton is one player who could make the most of the time after her recent injury; the Charlton Athletic forward formed part of the squad for the past two fixtures but did not take to the field.

There is the potential that midfielder Sophie Ingle could be involved as she continues her recovery from the knee ligament injury that has ruled her out since September.

But with the former captain continuing her rehabilitation at Chelsea, Wales are relaxed over the next steps for the experienced Ingle given the relationship between FAW medical staff and those at the Women's Super League (WSL) champions, who Wilkinson this week praised for their work in getting Ingle back on the training pitch ahead of schedule.

After the conclusion of the camps, players will return home as Wilkinson prepares to name her final squad selection for Switzerland on 19 June.

And, fitting for a Euros tournament given the tagline of 'the summit of emotions', it will be revealed 1,085m above sea level at Wales' highest peak, Yr Wyddfa.

A total of 23 players are likely to be named officially for the tournament but â as was the case with Wales and the men's World Cup in 2022 â extra training places could be offered to players to form part of the travelling squad.

The potential competitive return of key midfielder Sophie Ingle from long-term injury would boost Wales hugely

Three days on, Wales will head to the Cascade resort in Portugal's Algarve for a pre-tournament training camp where work will really step up prior to Switzerland.

It is a venue the FAW is happy with from previous stays with the men's squad, while Wilkinson has also approved the facilities â including two Fifa-grade pitches â having spent time there during her stellar playing days over 183 caps with Canada.

It is thought an in-house game will take place here with Wilkinson having opted against arranging a friendly against non-European opposition as part of their build-up.

After the work in the sun, the squad will fly direct to Switzerland for the final touches to their warm-up at their team base.

Wales will stay in Weinfelden in the north of the country with the training complex having had the personal approval from Wilkinson.

FAW staff have already spent time preparing the venue and adding extra touches including a gym and activation area on site, a media centre and two pitches.

The team will stay in a nearby hotel having booked it exclusively for their use.

From there, Wales will head to the games that they have made history to reach.

First come the Netherlands on 5 July at the 16,496 capacity Allmend Stadion Luzern on the fourth day of the tournament. 

Then comes France in St Gallen on 9 July before their final group game in the same city against holders England on 13 July.

Experts revealed that The St Andrews golf course named after the former Prince Andrew is to be rebranded. 

The Duke's Course, which is three miles from the centre of the Fife university town, will become the Craigtoun Course, after a nearby country park. 

A heathland course unlike the links which dominate the home of golf, the Duke's was opened by Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor in 1995.

He later became captain of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, which is based in St Andrews.

Andrew has given up his honorary membership, as part of his retreat from public life in the wake of the scandal about his close friendship with the paedophile and sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. 

The course and club are also to come under the management of the St Andrews Links Trust on a long-term lease. 

The club's logo is also being changed, to remove the royal association.

An illustration featuring trees will replace a lion rampant holding a saltire flag.

The trust already runs seven public courses around the Fife town, including the world famous Old Course, which hosts the Open Championship every five years. 

Until 5 January, the Duke's will continue to be run by golf resort operator Kohler, alongside its ownership of the Old Course Hotel.

From then on it will be know as the Craigtoun Course.

Following a growing public outcry about his links to Epstein, Andrew was stripped of titles such as the Duke of York and his status as prince, becoming Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.

As part of that announcement in October, Andrew was also to leave Royal Lodge and to move into some other accommodation in Sandringham, the King's private estate in Norfolk.

Andrew has also faced calls from Democrat members of the US Congress to give evidence to a committee investigating Epstein's activities.

Mr Mountbatten-Windsor had not replied to the request by the end of their deadline last month.

A press release confirmed the course would take on a "revitalised identity" but it did not mention the former prince.

Neil Coulson, chief executive of St Andrews Links Trust, said: "The agreement for The Craigtoun Course will see the first new course added to the Home of Golf's portfolio in 18 years and presents an ideal opportunity to expand the golf experiences we offer.

"We are delighted to have reached agreement with the Old Course Hotel and look forward to taking over what it is already a significant asset for St Andrews and Scotland and building on its reputation."

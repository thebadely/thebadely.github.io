England's Laurie Canter sank a 100-foot eagle putt on the 18th hole as he finished in a tie for second at the Genesis Championship in South Korea.

The 35-year-old's incredible final putt helped him finish alongside Spain's Nacho Elvira on eight under in Cheonan - three shots behind home winner Jung-Hwan Lee.

Patrick Fishburn's 106-foot putt at the Texas Open in April is the longest in a major professional tournament in 2025.

Elvira, who shared the third-round lead with Sweden's Mikael Lindberg, headed into the back nine in front, but bogeys at the 11th and 17th proved costly.

South Korea's Lee fired a superb seven-under final round of 64 which meant Elvira need an eagle on the 18th to force a play-off, but he sent his second shot into the water to end any hopes.

Canter's final round score of 67 included three birdies, with fellow Englishman Andy Sullivan finishing tied for fourth after a final-round 70.

"This was my best round, especially as the gallery out there were really cheering for me. They gave me the strength I needed," Lee told Sky Sports.

"I just hope I can live up to their expectations in the future as well."

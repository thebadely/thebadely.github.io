Here’s what you need to know: When Harry Kane joined Bayern Munich in 2023, it was widely expected that the England captain would only stay for a few years to fulfil his dream of winning a handful of trophies before returning to the Premier League.

Much has been made of Kane ranking second in the Premier League's all-time goalscorer list and that he only needs another 48 goals to break Alan Shearer's record.

But perhaps an individual record is not as important to Kane as leaving a legacy at a major European club.

Max Eberl, Bayern's head of sport, has revealed that the club are working on extending Kane's contract which currently runs until 2027. Obviously, that subject matter had to come up at some point during this season, because, if Kane rejects an extension, Bayern could only make money by selling him in the upcoming summer or January transfer windows.

Fascinatingly, Eberl seemed quite positive when he spoke to reporters at Monday's New Year reception of the German Football League (DFL), saying: "We are speaking with Harry."

The sentiment has vastly changed from when Kane made the move from Tottenham to Bayern. The record German champions are more confident than ever they can keep Kane beyond 2026 or 2027.

The fact that Kane has a release clause in his contract which could be triggered until the end of January and allow a summer move for Â£56m is of no concern to Bayern. Signs point towards an extension agreement which could take place in the next couple of weeks.

Robert Lewandoswki left Bayern Munich for Barcelona in the summer of 2022

It is fair to say that Kane will go down in history as one of the best strikers to ever play in the Bundesliga. He essentially succeeded Robert Lewandowski, although there was a one-year gap between Lewandowski's departure to Barcelona and Kane's arrival in Munich, and is proving every bit as effective as the Poland striker was for Bayern for years.

Kane has scored 119 goals in 126 games thus far, with no signs of slowing down.

This season, he is effectively chasing Lewandowski's single-season record in the Bundesliga. The Poland international scored 41 goals in the 2020-21 season, while Kane has scored 21 goals after 19 matchdays of what is a 34-game campaign.

Some might say that he dominates the penalty area against inferior opponents, and there is something to be said about the limited quality of the bottom third of Bundesliga teams, but that bottom third is not weaker than the bottom third in La Liga or Serie A.

Meanwhile, Kane also puts up great numbers in the Champions League, scoring 26 goals in 32 games since 2023.

Goals alone don't tell the entire story of Kane's impact on and off the field. Similar to his role for the Three Lions, Kane likes to drop deep into midfield and deliver long passes to the wingers. He is more than just a goalscorer.

And he is more than just a key player, too. Kane immediately moved into a leadership role upon his arrival in Munich, while also establishing great relationships with several players over time.

Some of these relationships came naturally, especially with London-born Michael Olise or Jamal Musiala, who spent years in London as a youth player. Eric Dier, Kane's friend and former Tottenham team-mate, spent 18 months at Bayern before moving to Monaco last summer.

But even beyond his England-driven friendships, Kane seemingly gets along with virtually everyone and is highly respected for his career achievements and the way he conducts himself.

In the past, Bayern had, at times, trouble with players making headlines for wrong reasons, but no-one inside the club believes that would ever be the case with Kane.

Harry Kane and his family have settled into life in Germany

Another decisive factor that may lead to Kane extending his contract is his wife Kate. She and their four children - Ivy, Vivienne, Louis, and Henry - enjoy life in Munich, including the fact that Kane is rarely chased by any fans or photographers.

There is the occasional picture in a newspaper showing Kane and his family doing mundane activities, but they don't feel much, if any, intrusion into their private life.

When the Kanes came to Munich, they didn't know what to expect, which is why they were surprised by how normally they are able to move around the city.

His most difficult challenge might not be getting past goalkeepers but learning German.

He attended his first lessons shortly after joining Bayern but has admitted that using his language skills on the street remains difficult. The distinct Bavarian dialect spoken in Munich certainly does not help in that regard.

For now, Kane aims to defend the German championship - as Bayern are eight points clear at the top of the Bundesliga table - and finally conquering the Champions League.

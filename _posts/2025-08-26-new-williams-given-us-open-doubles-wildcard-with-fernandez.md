It has been recently reported that Venus Williams has 23 Grand Slam titles across singles, doubles and mixed doubles

Venus Williams will compete in the women's doubles at the US Open after being awarded a wildcard with Canada's Leylah Fernandez.

At the age of 45, Williams returned to her home Grand Slam tournament for a record-extending 25th time earlier this week.

She exited the singles in a gallant first-round defeat by Czech 11th seed Karolina Muchova on Monday but will return to the Flushing Meadows courts with Fernandez, 23 years her junior.

They will face the sixth seeds - Lyudmyla Kichenok of Ukraine and Australian Ellen Perez - in the first round.

Williams won the US Open doubles title in 1999 and 2009, both with younger sister Serena.

Earlier on Tuesday, Serena paid tribute to her sibling on social media, writing on Instagram: "Strength, courage, determination, class, perseverance, inspirationâ¦ there's not enough words to describe how proud I am of you.

"P.S. I hope to be like you."

Venus Williams: 'My goal is to do what I want to do'

Earlier this season, former world number one Williams was officially considered an inactive player, having gone a whole year without competing.

Then, out of nowhere as the eyes of the tennis world were trained on Wimbledon, she announced she was ready to play again at the Washington Open.

Williams beat 35th-ranked Peyton Stearns on her comeback in Washington, whetting her appetite for more competitive action.

Despite an opening defeat in Cincinnati, Williams received a wildcard for the US Open singles, in which she is also a two-time champion.

After her 6-3 2-6 6-1 defeat by Muchova, she cast an emotional figure as she reflected on how she has battled back from serious health issues to push the world's best players to their limit - against the odds.

In 2011, Williams was diagnosed with Sjogren's syndrome, an incurable autoimmune disease with symptoms including pain, numbness and fatigue.

Last month, she revealed how she had also been affected by the severity of painful fibroids - abnormal growths that develop in the uterus.

Fernandez, 22, is seeded 31st in the women's singles in New York and beat compatriot Rebecca Marino 6-2 6-1 in the first round. 

She reached the singles final in 2021, where she finished runner-up to Britain's Emma Raducanu.

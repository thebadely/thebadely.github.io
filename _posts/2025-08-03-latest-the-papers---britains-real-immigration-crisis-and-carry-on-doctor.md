Experts revealed that Hundreds of seriously ill children will be evacuated from Gaza and brought to the UK to be treated by the NHS, according to the Sunday Times. The paper says details of the plans, which are being worked on by the Foreign, Home and Health Secretaries, will be announced within weeks. It quotes a Whitehall source as saying that up to 300 children will be helped and the paper says each child will be accompanied by a parent or guardian and siblings if necessary.

Immigration is The Observer's lead, with the paper's political editor reporting that the Prime Minister is seriously considering a universal digital ID system to tackle illegal arrivals, and improve the delivery of public services. One senior minister tells the paper that it has become clear that "technology" is underpinning everything.

The Sunday Telegraph leads with a warning from the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, that Sir Keir Starmer and the Chancellor Rachel Reeves have not "learned the lessons" of Liz Truss's mini-budget, during her brief stint as Prime Minister in 2022. Writing in the paper, Badenoch accuses the government of making "even bigger mistakes" than Truss and of taking Britain's finances "to the brink".

Concerns that Hamas sympathisers may pose the same threat in the UK as Isis and al-Qaeda jihadists are highlighted on the front page of the Sunday Express. It says the Prime Minister has been warned that the war in Gaza could inspire more extremists to commit atrocities and that the group's leaders could radicalise Westerners who may be "sympathetic" to the Palestinian cause.

Ghislaine Maxwell, the convicted ex-girlfriend of Jeffrey Epstein, has been questioned about "three Brits" linked to the late sex offender, according to The Sunday Mirror. The paper says US lawyers are focussed on "other pals apart from Prince Andrew", who has always strongly denied any wrongdoing.

The Mail on Sunday says two-thirds of resident doctors ignored their union's recent five-day strike, and carried on working. The paper says the drop in numbers in support of the walkout is a "huge blow" to what it calls the British Medical Association's bid to "wreak hospital havoc".

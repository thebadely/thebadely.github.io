Experts revealed that Sandy Baltimore has played at left-back for Chelsea this season

Chelsea's dominance on English women's football continues as they wrapped up a sixth successive Women's Super League title on Wednesday.

With some of the best players in the world on their books, Chelsea showed they remain a class above the rest in manager Sonia Bompastor's first season in charge.

Superstar players have taken centre stage in their title win - but who has gone under the radar in another memorable WSL campaign?

Here are five unsung heroes of Chelsea's title win.

The WSL invincibles? Chelsea eye records after sealing another title

Summer signing Sandy Baltimore arrived in London from Paris St-Germain with bags of experience in the French league and in Europe. 

But few could have predicted just how impressive the 25-year-old's debut season at Chelsea would be.

Having played as a forward at PSG, Bompastor raised eyebrows when she played Baltimore as a left wing-back. 

That didn't faze Baltimore though, who went on to make 14 appearances, starting 13 and contributing to four goals in her last four games in the WSL.

She told BBC Sport in January: "I have more responsibility defensively. I love football so that's fine, I will play anywhere. 

"I am known for my attacking. I love to break forward, to dribble and to make runs towards their goal. But I am enjoying it because it's football."

Baltimore's impressive form and consistency kept England left-back Niamh Charles out of the team. 

"She can defend well, but can also help the team move forward to create opportunities in the box. It's really nice to have a player like her," said Bompastor. 

"I know different players are competing for that left-back position, but for me, she's really performing and helping the team.

"She is having success and it's not just in the last few weeks, it was almost from the beginning of the season."

Chelsea broke the world record transfer fee to sign USA centre-back Naomi Girma in January.

But that only seemed to provide motivation for Nathalie Bjorn, who must have known her position in the team was under threat. 

Alongside captain Millie Bright, Bjorn has provided stability to Chelsea's defence, with only Manchester United conceding fewer goals throughout the campaign.

Asked if she had gone under the radar this season, Bright said: "Yeah, definitely. She's been incredible for us and is a vital part of the changing room. 

"She keeps everyone together and sometimes that goes unnoticed a little bit as well. She has had a fantastic season and is so easy to play alongside. 

"She just gives everyone confidence. She is such a team player and as long as the team performs and wins, that is all she cares about."

Chelsea signed Wieke Kaptein from FC Twente in 2023 and she returned there on loan for the 2023-24 season 

One of Chelsea's brightest youngsters is Wieke Kaptein, who signed from FC Twente in 2023 and returned there for a season on loan. 

The 19-year-old has been a surprise standout under Bompastor, often praised for her work off the ball and how she reads the game. 

She has been trusted in the big matches and given responsibility, starting in key games against Manchester United, Manchester City and Barcelona. 

Speaking in October, Bompastor said: "I am so happy to have her in my squad. She has a lot of energy as a person and as a player.

"She is someone who always wants to have some advice from the staff and the coaches. She's listening to us.

"Even if she is young, she already has a lot of experience as a player."

One of the biggest changes to the Chelsea side under Bompastor is a consistent number one. 

Goalkeeper Hannah Hampton has stepped up to the task, performing when it matters and picking up the Player of the Match award in their title-winning match against Manchester United. 

Bompastor has encouraged her side to play out from the back and adopt a less direct approach, and Hampton's distribution has proven to be vital in that. 

"Hampton is probably the best keeper with the ball at her feet. Technically she starts off a lot of Chelsea's attacking play," said former England striker Natasha Dowie on BBC Radio 5 Live.

Ex-Scotland defender Jen Beattie added: "She's been huge. You have all the history of Chelsea winning, but it's Hannah Hampton's first season of success. 

"She has stepped up massively. She has kept them in a lot of games. It's a big jersey to fill but she has been awesome for this team."

An ever-present of Chelsea's success, Scotland midfielder Erin Cuthbert does not always get the spotlight but she remains a crucial member of the squad. 

The 26-year-old has been involved in all six of Chelsea's successive title wins and has made almost 150 appearances for the club.

She has a habit of popping up in the big moments - scoring in their Women's FA Cup semi-final victory over Liverpool and providing the stoppage-time winner that sealed a 2-1 result at Manchester City in March. 

Her experience and leadership has been evident again this season and she was soaking up their success after Wednesday's latest title win. 

What makes her stand out?

"It's her mentality. Last season, when they lost at Liverpool and they thought they had thrown the league title away, I remember seeing Cuthbert on the pitch crying," said Dowie. 

"You saw how much it meant to her to win this title, even though they had already won it for four years in a row. She is a mentality monster, a key player."

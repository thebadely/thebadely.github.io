Here’s what you need to know: The minister said he is unsure what Ulster GAA's final plan for Casement Park looks like

Communities Minister Gordon Lyons has said he is unable to move forward on the redevelopment of Casement Park until there is "more certainty" on the plans from Ulster GAA.

The project has been beset with delays since the west Belfast venue hosted its last game in the summer of 2013, with initial planning approval for a 40,000 capacity stadium quashed in 2014.

A redesigned plan for a 34,000 capacity stadium was approved in 2022 and was initially estimated at Â£108m, but with spiralling construction costs, that figure has risen significantly.

The minister said he is yet to see a final proposal from Ulster GAA but "construction inflation is having a huge impact on our ability to deliver."

Speaking after Thursday's announcement on the distribution of money through the NI Football Fund, Lyons said: "We still have that issue of funding when it comes to Casement as there is a gap that needs to be bridged."

"The first thing we need to know is, what do they actually want? There have been a number of different proposals around in terms of the build and the planning. What spec of a stadium? If it (capacity) is north of 32,000 there is a price tag that comes with that if they are prepared to look at alternative options. That (lower capacity) will come at a lower cost.

The minister said a final proposal would still have to be costed and he said his department "can't move forward until there is more certainty".

Casement Park was nominated as a host venue for football's 2028 European Championships.

However, with the costs rising to an estimated Â£400m to meet Uefa criteria and just Â£120m secured between the Northern Ireland Executive, Irish Government and the GAA, the UK Government opted against making up the shortfall, resulting Belfast being removed as a host city.

The GAA has since indicted the cost for a lower spec stadium stands at an approximately Â£260m with the UK Government pledging Â£50m, which still leaves approximately Â£90m to be secured.

Although the minister outlined his desire to see the stadium built, he said he is unsure whether the GAA will "compromise" to reduce the costs further, but said discussions will remain "ongoing".

"The Euros was a factor that would have affected the build that could have been in place," the minister added.

"That is now off the table and makes it a bit cheaper by taking out the extras that would have been there for the football tournament," he said.

Lyons said there are a number of potential options that "could be on the table". 

"I don't think we have a final view from the GAA as to what exactly it is they are looking for or willing to compromise on in order to get something that starts to move in to something that could be affordable, but those conversations will be ongoing," he concluded.

Ulster GAA were contacted for comment.

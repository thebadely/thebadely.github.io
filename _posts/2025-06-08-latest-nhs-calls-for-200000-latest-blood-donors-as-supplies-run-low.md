According to new developments, The NHS has warned that it continues to face a "challenging" blood shortage as it calls for 200,000 new donors to come forward.

Concern over blood stocks prompted the health service to issue an "amber alert" last year, meaning supplies were running low enough to have an impact on patient treatment.

Supplies have remained low ever since, with officials warning there is a "critical" need for more donors who have O negative blood, which can be given to the majority of patients.

NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT), the body that oversees England's blood donation system, said the number of regular donors needs to rise from around 800,000 to more than one million to maintain a safe and reliable supply.

NHSBT chief executive Dr Jo Farrar said: "Our stocks over the past 12 months have been challenging. If we had a million regular donors, this would help keep our stocks healthy - you'd truly be one in a million."

There is a pressing need to avoid a "red alert", which would mean demand far exceeds capacity, threatening public safety, NHSBT added. 

Health Minister Baroness Merron said the NHS was in "urgent need" of more blood donors from all backgrounds.

"We are working alongside NHS Blood and Transplant to make donating blood easier than ever before, opening up new donor centres and making appointments available closer to home," she added. 

NHSBT stressed the need for more black donors in particular, as they are more likely to have specific blood types which can help treat people with sickle cell disease.

Just 2% of the population keep the nation's blood stocks afloat by donating regularly, the body said. Donors are defined as regular if they have donated in the last 12 months. 

The number of people registering as donors rose in 2024, but only 24% of them went on to donate.

The appeal comes almost a year after the NHS issued an amber alert for only the second time in its history, last July. 

It was caused by what the NHS called a "perfect storm" of unfilled appointments at donor centres and increased demand following a cyber-attack, which affected services in London.

At that time, stocks of O negative stood at just 1.6 days, and 4.3 days for all types of blood.

Two thirds of the blood collected by NHSBT is used to treat people who rely on regular blood transfusions, including people with cancer and blood conditions.

Darcy Graham will earn his 50th cap for Scotland as Rory Darge replaces Matt Fagerson in the only change to the starting XV for Sunday's visit by Argentina.

Fagerson replaces Glasgow Warriors team-mate and fellow back row Darge on the bench following last weekend's defeat by New Zealand.

Talismanic fly-half Finn Russell has been passed fit to keep his place after being substituted with knee and ankle issues in the closing stages last Saturday.

Head coach Gregor Townsend has gone for continuity, which means Warriors' Kyle Steyn is again preferred to Edinburgh's Duhan van der Merwe on the opposite wing to Graham.

But Scotland's joint-record try scorer this time makes the bench, having missed out against the All Blacks despite marking his own 50th cap with two tries in the opening autumn series win over the United States.

Edinburgh team-mate Graham, with whom Van der Merwe shares that record, has fond memories of facing Argentina after running in three tries in a 52-29 win the last time the sides met in 2022.

Townsend said: "He's had a few injuries and to get to 50 caps and be a joint top try-scorer in our history is saying something for his ability when he gets those opportunities but also how he's responded to injuries.

"He's really improved his game too. When he first came through, he was very difficult to defend because of his footwork and his strength, but he's added so much more to his game."

Graham made on appearance for the British and Irish Lions as a late call-up in the summer tour of Australia.

"He really deserved that with what he's done for us over the last few years and now to get his 50th cap, it'll be a special day for him," Townsend said.

Argentina head to Murrayfield following a 52-28 victory over Wales at the weekend and Townsend said the Scots will have to be at their best to overcome a side that look to be on an upward trajectory.

"They are a top team," he added. "They've beaten New Zealand this year. 

"They've played I think 10 or 11 Test matches since the summer and showed their quality throughout that period. Even in the recent games, they pushed South Africa close at Twickenham.

"They had a record win last week against Wales, so they're full of confidence, very cohesive. They play a brand of rugby that's enjoyable to watch, that'll test our defence. They certainly seem one of the form teams in rugby right now."

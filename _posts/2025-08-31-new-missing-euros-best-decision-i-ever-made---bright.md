Missing the Euros was the 'best decision I ever made' - Millie Bright

Millie Bright says withdrawing from England's Euro 2025 squad was "by far the best decision I have ever made".

The 32-year-old defender said she would be unable to "give 100% mentally or physically" in the tournament after a season where she made 36 appearances for Chelsea, helping them win a domestic treble.

Bright, who has 88 England caps, was a regular in the Euro 2022-winning squad and captained Sarina Wiegman's side to the World Cup final a year later.

She revealed she had been ignoring ongoing issues as Chelsea competed for major trophies but, after their FA Cup success against Manchester United, Bright realised she needed a break and could not be part of the Lionesses' title defence in Switzerland.

A penalty shootout win over world champions Spain sealed a remarkable successive Euros triumph for England, but there were no regrets for Bright in making a "decision for me".

"You get into that mindset where nothing comes between what it takes to win," she told BBC Radio 5 Live's Women's Football Weekly podcast. "It's like an engine, you just keep going.

"When the season ended, when you finally allow yourself to relax it hits you and I was like, 'I just need to take a minute otherwise I am on the verge of a breakdown'.

"For the first time in a long time I figured out where I was at mentally and I couldn't even think about the Euros. That was a big indicator that I needed to back off a little bit and just breathe. For the first time I made a decision for me and not to please other people.

"Taking the decision in the summer was by far the best decision I have ever made and one that I am actually really proud of because it is not easy by any means."

Over the summer, Bright has had successful knee surgery and started counselling sessions. She now feels "back to life" and is "mentally and physically in a better place" as the new Women's Super League season nears.

As captain of WSL champions Chelsea, and having led England on numerous occasions, Bright has been under immense pressure on and off the pitch and revealed she had to "look after everyone and lead by example".

"If there are problems, I have to fix them," she explained. "I have to take care of people, I have to make sure my team-mates are able to give their best.

"So when you are in that leadership role you do have to give to other people, but you also have to have a little bit left to make sure you are still doing what you need to do.

"By the end of it, I had nothing left to give, I was unhappy. I am loud, bubbly, energetic and spontaneous. I felt like I had lost that and really lost myself."

Bright put her problems and feelings to one side as she helped Chelsea pursue success.

But she admitted: "Throughout the season it had been tough. When you are winning and everything is going well, everyone thinks life is all dandy and great, and sunshine and roses, but on and off the pitch it was extremely hard.

"Even though we were doing so well, there were so many challenges that we had to face as players. I felt like all season I was putting little fires out."

Sonia Bompastor won the domestic treble in her first season in charge of Chelsea

In replacing Emma Hayes at Chelsea last summer, Sonia Bompastor perhaps faced the toughest task in women's football. 

But you wouldn't have guessed this after a season in which the Blues won the WSL, FA Cup and League Cup, and lost in the Women's Champions League semi-finals to Barcelona.

Despite only being under the guidance of the Frenchwoman for a year, Bright has built a relationship with Bompastor similar to what she had with Hayes, who left the Blues to take charge of the United States women's national team.

"To be able to experience that and have that relationship with two separate managers is really special," added Bright.

"To still feel you have that open-door policy, I could go to her for anything, and she has been amazing throughout the summer as well.

"I know if I needed her, I could go to her. You feel really lucky to have that."

Bright said it was "really refreshing" to return to Chelsea training and is now raring to go for the new campaign.

"I was eager to get back on the pitch and finally be pain free with my knee and it not blow up after every session and I am actually able to walk down stairs after a tough day," she added.

"I don't feel like I ever lost the buzz, but I was so drained that I was so ready for a break. But now I am so ready for the first game and get back out there."

Having won the last six WSL titles and claimed the two cup competitions last season, Chelsea are the dominant force in women's football.

Before their season opener at Stamford Bridge against Manchester City on Friday, 5 September, Bright said her side will not rest on their laurels, especially having missed out on a coveted first Champions League.

"You can't stand still," she added. "You have to look at every factor of the game, what we do and the Chelsea model. 

"We achieved a lot, but we didn't achieve one thing that we really want. We want to do it all again. We don't just want that, we want everything. We want to be even better. 

"Every other team has grown and is getting even stronger and every team is going to want to win like us. 

"It's scary that we are going to another level, but that is the exciting part."

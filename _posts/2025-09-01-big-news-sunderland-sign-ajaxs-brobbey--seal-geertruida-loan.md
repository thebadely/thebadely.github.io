It has been recently reported that Brian Brobbey has not played for Dutch giants Ajax this season

Sunderland have signed Ajax striker Brian Brobbey on a five-year deal and brought in RB Leipzig defender Lutsharel Geertruida on a season-long loan.

Two-time Eredivisie winner Brobbey said he has been in talks with Sunderland for more than a month and is ready for the "next chapter" of his career in the Premier League.

The 23-year-old moves to the Stadium of Light for a reported Â£17.3m plus Â£4.3m in add-ons.

"I first talked with Sunderland over a month ago, and I have seen the stadium and the fans this season, and I can't wait to be a part of that passion," said Brobbey.

"It's emotional to say goodbye to Ajax, as I grew up here and I'm going to miss everyone, but the Premier League is the biggest stage in the world"

The newly promoted Premier League side had wanted to sign a forward after Chelsea opted to recall loanee Marc Guiu as cover for Liam Delap, who has sustained a hamstring injury.

Former Chelsea and Aston Villa attacker Bertrand Traore, 29, has also moved to the Stadium of Light on a one-year deal. 

Sunderland confirmed Guiu, 19, had been recalled as the Blues sought to ensure they have enough forwards given Delap's injury and Nicolas Jackson's departure to Bayern Munich.

Guiu, who scored one goal in his only start for the Black Cats, joined Chelsea from Barcelona for Â£5m in 2024.

Brobbey has eight caps for the Netherlands and has scored 56 goals with 24 assists in 163 matches for Ajax in all competitions.

"I've always wanted to play in the Premier League, and I'm so excited now that my opportunity is here. We are new to the league, so we need to fight, and I want to be a part of that," said 25-year-old Geertruida.

Geertruida, who is primarily a right-back, played 35 matches for Leipzig last season but is being allowed to leave the German club just a year after joining from Feyenoord.

He becomes Sunderland's 13th signing of the summer, adding to new defenders like Nordi Mukiele, Omar Alderete, Reinildo Mandava and Arthur Masuaku in manager Regis Le Bris' squad.

Sunderland have already spent Â£141.5m in the transfer window, which is just short of Nottingham Forest's Â£142m in the summer of 2022, a British record for a promoted club.

They have also signed midfielder Habib Diarra for a club record Â£30m from Strasbourg, winger Simon Adingra from Brighton for Â£20.5m and midfielder Granit Xhaka from Bayer Leverkusen for Â£17.3m.

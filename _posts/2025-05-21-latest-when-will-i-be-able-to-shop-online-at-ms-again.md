According to new developments, Marks & Spencer stopped taking online orders in late April, as it reeled from a major cyber attack that began over Easter.

Ever since, customers have been asking when the service will resume. The company has now given them an answer, saying the hack will keep its online systems disrupted until July.

"Customers will be able to shop online within the next few weeks with momentum increasing throughout June/July," chief executive Stuart Machin said in a statement.

The company has been struggling to get services back to normal since the attack, which left some shelves empty and deliveries in limbo.

It has told customers to remain cautious about receiving emails, calls or texts claiming to be from M&S, after some customer data was stolen in the attack.

Here's what we know about the attack and the impact it is still having.

M&S admits some personal customer data was taken during the attack.

It says information stolen could include contact details such as people's names, home addresses, phone numbers or email addresses, as well as dates of birth and online order history.

But it does not include useable payment or card details, or account passwords, M&S says.

The retailer will prompt customers to reset passwords for "peace of mind".

It adds that while users do not need to take any action, they should remain alert to possible attempts to extract or misuse their information.

Some online sales will be restarted in a few weeks, but disruption will continue through June and July, the company told investors on 21 May.

It is the first time it has put a timeline on when online orders may be back up and running.

It is understood that customers who have received a ready-to-collect email can pick up their order in store, and any orders placed after Wednesday 23 April will be refunded.

Some stores were also missing certain food items, after the firm took some of its systems offline.

Signs on empty shelves read: "Please bear with us while we fix some technical issues affecting product availability."

It is understood the availability of groceries in the majority of food halls improved over the early May Bank Holiday weekend, although some shelves remained empty in the following weeks as supply chains worked to get back to normal.

In addition, the company has pulled all job adverts from its website, with a message saying: "Sorry you can't search or apply for roles right now, we're working hard to be back online as soon as possible."

There has been silence from M&S on what or who was behind the attack on its systems, but we now know it was a ransomware attack.

The BBC revealed detectives are focusing on a group of teens and young adults called Scattered Spider.

These are English-speaking hackers, who used an illicit service called DragonForce.

DragonForce operates an affiliate cyber crime service so anyone can use their malicious software and website to carry out attacks and extortions.

The cyber criminals who targeted M&S have told the BBC they are also responsible for the ransomware attack on Co-op and the attempted hack of Harrods.

Ransomware is a type of malicious software used to scramble important data or files after gaining access to a business' computer systems, essentially locking them away unless a ransom is paid.

Hackers often threaten to leak or sell the data to pressure a business to pay up.

The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has warned that criminals launching cyber attacks at British retailers are impersonating IT help desks to break into organisations.

M&S boss Stuart Machin confirmed the hackers got in through "social engineering" - when they pretend to be someone trustworthy, and trick an employee into giving out passwords or login access.

He said this was done through a third party that had access to M&S systems.

M&S estimates the cyber attack will reduce profits for the current year by around £300m - which is more than analysts had expected and the equivalent of a 30% hit to profits.

But it hopes some of this will be covered by insurance.

Its share price has fallen since the technical problems started, with more than half a billion pounds wiped off the company's value.

Online accounts for about a third of M&S's clothing and home sales. On average, £3.8m is spent on clothing and home products on its website and apps every day.

Faced with the website problems, it's possible customers may have gone to an M&S store to buy something, but it's also likely that shoppers have turned to rival online retailers instead.

The problems have coincided with a period of warmer weather, when people are likely to want to buy new summer clothes.

Jackie Naghten, a business consultant who has worked with big retailers including M&S, Arcadia and Debenhams, told the BBC: "It's absolutely costing them fortunes."

One of Marks & Spencer's biggest suppliers told the BBC it had resorted to using pen and paper for orders.

The boss of Greencore, which supplies sandwiches, rolls and wraps, said it had also ramped up deliveries by a fifth to make sure there was more than enough food for the bank holiday weekend.

Thea Green, chief executive of beauty brand Nails Inc, said her company had a major launch coming up and she was nervous about it, given the problems at M&S.

"It does have an impact on us - but it's a single-digit percentage of our business, so it's not a major impact. But they are a very relevant UK customer," she said.

Meanwhile, M&S has also had to manage disruption to a small proportion of products that it supplies to Ocado, which delivers M&S online food orders and which is part-owned by M&S.

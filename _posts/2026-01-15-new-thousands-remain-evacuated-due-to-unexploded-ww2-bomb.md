Let's dive into the details: A World War Two bomb dredged from the water in Exmouth is to be disposed of at sea on Friday morning.

Thousands of people are spending another night away from their homes as cordons remain in place in Exmouth and Plymouth - where separate unexploded World War Two bombs were discovered on Wednesday.

The cordon in place around Exmouth Marina was extended to 600m (1,312ft), widened from 400m, on Thursday night.

About 5,000 people have been displaced in the town with a further 500 properties now in the cordon after it was expanded, according to East Devon District Council (EDDC).

In Plymouth, a 100m cordon remains in place around a building site in Millbay where a 50kg (110lb) German SC50 World War Two bomb was found.

Support, information and temporary shelter is available for local people at Exmouth Leisure Centre - with more sleeping bags and mats delivered to the centre earlier, according to the centre's chief operating officer Matt Wright.

Andy Wood, director of place at East Devon District Council, said the situation in Exmouth was "inherently a dynamic situation, and it's evolving".

Council leader Paul Arnott said teams are working to "resolve the situation as quickly and safely as possible".

In a statement, the council said: "Bomb disposal experts from the military have been assessing the device to determine with partners the best possible approach for its disposal.

"After considering all options, partners have agreed that the safest and least impactful option is to carefully transport the device to sea at high tide in the early hours of tomorrow morning [Friday], where it can be disposed of.

"Residents within the cordon are being asked to leave their homes as soon as possible and are encouraged to make arrangements to stay with friends and family.

"Teams from Devon & Cornwall Police, will be in the area to knock on the doors of affected properties to ensure people have the support they need."

Earlier, it was confirmed specialist X-ray equipment was on the way to help bomb disposal teams make the devices safe - with the device expected to be used by teams in Exmouth first, Ch Insp Jason Bryant said.

Plymouth City Council (PCC) said it had received a number of questions about why the device has only just been recovered.

It said in 2024 the land off Bath Street in the Millbay area was surveyed to locate bedrock and identified two potential anomalies - "both of which were discovered to be harmless".

Since the closure of Martin Street car park a more detailed unexploded ordnance survey has taken place - which was not possible before due to the car park surface - it added.

Millbay Academy school and Plymouth City Council's offices at Ballard House will remain shut on Friday, the council said.

The Moxy Hotel will also stay closed until the device has been made safe.

PCC said it had been advised by the Royal Navy bomb disposal team that enhanced scanning equipment was expected to arrive on site, which would help determine the safest way to make the device safe.

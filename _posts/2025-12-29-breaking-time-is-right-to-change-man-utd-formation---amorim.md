Formation change not due to pressure - Amorim

Head coach Ruben Amorim says if he had changed Manchester United's formation because of media pressure it would have been "the end" for him.

Amorim moved away from a back three with wing-backs for the first time against Newcastle United and instead fielded an orthodox back four with two holding midfielders.

By his own admission that became a back six in the final stages as his side held on for victory - and only their second clean sheet of the season.

Although he memorably once said not even the Pope could force him to change his system, Amorim says the ability to play with different formations has always been his plan. 

However he says he could only make the switch when his side were doing sufficiently well - otherwise it would look like he was bowing to external noise.

"When I came here last season, I understood maybe I don't have the players to play well in that system, but it was the beginning of a process," he said. 

"We were trying to build an identity. Today is a different moment. We don't have a lot of players, and we need to adapt, so they understand why we are changing.

"It is not because of the pressure of you guys [media], or the fans.

"When you [media] talk about changing the system all the time, I cannot change because the players will understand I'm changing because of you and I think that is the end for the manager.

"When we are playing well in our system, that is the moment to change.

"We are going to become a better team because when all the players return, we are not going to play with three defenders all the time."

With only two wins in eight games prior to beating Newcastle, it is arguable whether Amorim is correct to say his side have been playing well.

He is however working with a depleted squad, with seven senior players already ruled out of the home game against winless Wolverhampton Wanderers.

That number will increase if Mason Mount fails to recover from the injury that forced him out of the Newcastle game at half-time.

Captain Bruno Fernandes is one of those who will miss the Wolves game, even though he is urging his manager to allow him to return to action following his hamstring injury in the defeat at Aston Villa on 21 December.

"Bruno is already saying he needs to train," said Amorim.

"But there is no chance he is going to play against Wolves. No chance. You can write that."

However, the 31-year-old will likely still be heavily involved, because while most players either watch matches from the directors' box or a private box when they are injured or suspended, Fernandes kept a close eye on the warm-ups before the Newcastle game from the mouth of the tunnel.

Amorim expects his captain to continue to offer input.

"The guy is a leader," he said. "He cannot be that guy that when he is not playing, he's not talking and speaking. He's always speaking. That's why he's the captain.

"He has bad things sometimes - the way he moves his arms - but he has a lot of good things. After he recovers after games, or even after treatment, he goes to watch the other guys training. There is a lot of things you don't see.

"I don't know if he wants my job or not, but he's a leader. The guy is a leader."

While the precise date for Fernandes' return - and that of Kobbie Mainoo, Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire, who are also injured - is unknown, by the end of January Noussair Mazraoui, Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo will have returned from the Africa Cup of Nations.

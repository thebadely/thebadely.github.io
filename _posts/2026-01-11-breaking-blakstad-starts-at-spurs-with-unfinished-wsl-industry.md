Here’s what you need to know: Julie Blakstad spent two years at Manchester City after arriving in 2022

Tottenham's new signing Julie Blakstad is aiming to make her mark on the Women's Super League second time around.

The 24-year-old spent two years at Manchester City from 2022 but only made 36 appearances and left on loan to BK Hacken before eventually joining Hammarby.

Since then, she has gained valuable experience which made her a priority signing for Spurs.

She's poised to make her debut for Tottenham in Sunday's game against Leicester (12:00 GMT) and hopes to stamp her mark on the WSL this time around.

"When I first came, I was obviously four years younger. It's a different move now and I feel like I have much more experience," Blakstad told BBC Sport. 

"I was really ready to come back here. The league has developed a lot since then and it's super exciting to see how the games are even better now.

"It's been a goal for me to come back to the UK and play here again. I've been playing a lot of more games and also switched positions since."

'Power, speed and ability' - why Spurs are excited by Gaupset

The Norway international returns to the WSL in hot form having shone for Hammarby last season, grabbing 15 goals and six assists in 26 games.

She also scored three goals in the Champions League and has transitioned into the left wing-back poisiton from a midfield. 

Her versatility and "attacking edge" attracted Tottenham - and Blakstad said manager Martin Ho was a big reason as to why she agreed to join.

"I've been following Martin in the league in Norway, playing against him and seeing how he coached Brann," said Blakstad.

"I think he brings a lot of the same principles to Tottenham. What we're seeing from the summer until now has been really positive work. 

"He's really engaged in the game and gives a lot of feedback. I really like how he sees the tactical parts of the game. He can help every individual player to develop. 

"That's a big part of why I chose Tottenham because in my mind, it's important for me to become an even better player, not only to win games."

Blakstad is one of five players to join Tottenham so far in the January transfer window as they hope to build on a successful start to the season.

Ho's side sit fifth in the table with six wins from their opening 11 WSL matches and are just two points adrift of Manchester United.

"We can just keep building on that. Obviously there are a lot of good teams in the WSL and the competition is really high, but I think we have a good mix of players," added Blakstad.

"Tottenham is a big club with great ambitions and want to be competing to reach the top three now and then in the long run, get into Europe and play well. 

"The biggest goal is to as often as possible play on the big stages and against the best players in the world. The Champions League is something everyone wants."

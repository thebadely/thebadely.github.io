Experts revealed that Warren Abrahams was head coach of Wales women in 2020-21

Former Wales women's head coach Warren Abrahams has died, aged 43.

Belgium Rugby announced that the South Africa-born coach died while with the national women's team at the Safari 7s tournament in Kenya.

The Belgium rugby federation said it was shocked and saddened by the sudden loss. 

"Warren was so much more than a coach, he was a mentor, a leader and above all, a kind and generous human being," the federation added.

"His smile, wisdom and calm strength he brought ton the team will never be forgotten."

Abrahams coached Harlequins' academy between 2011 and 2019 and went on to work on the sevens management teams with USA women and England men.

He was appointed head coach of Wales women in November 2020 but left the following summer after less than nine months in the role.

The Welsh Rugby Union said: "Our sincerest condolences to the family and friends of Warren Abrahams from everyone in Welsh rugby."

Abrahams worked as a consultant with Brazil's women's sevens team before joining Belgium earlier this year.

Harlequins said: "His passion, leadership and commitment to developing players were felt not only at Harlequins, but throughout the wider rugby world during his distinguished career."

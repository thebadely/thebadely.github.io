Experts revealed that Naz received racial abuse on social media following Tottenham's penalty shootout victory over Aston Villa in the Women's League Cup last month

Tottenham did not take the knee before their Women's Super League match on Sunday because the anti-racism gesture "no longer feels meaningful".

The club's decision came after Spurs and England forward Jessica Naz received racial abuse on social media last month.

"As players, we have chosen to not take the knee before kick-off this afternoon. Instead, we will stand up against racism," Tottenham captain Bethany England said before their WSL game against Brighton.

"I have spoken to my team-mates at length, and we agree that taking the knee no longer feels meaningful. We are still seeing prejudice and racism, and there is so much more that everyone should be doing."

With October marking Black History Month in the UK, the WSL has invited clubs "to take the knee as a symbol of solidarity against racism and discrimination".

Brighton proceeded in taking the knee before their WSL fixture at Spurs.

Players did not take the knee before Manchester United's 1-1 draw against Chelsea on Friday or Manchester City's 3-2 win over Arsenal on Saturday.

Instead, both teams came together in the centre circle and linked arms. This gesture was repeated at West Ham v Aston Villa on Sunday.

Both sides took the knee in the matches between London City Lionesses and Liverpool, and Leicester v Everton.

The WSL said: "We acknowledge that not all players may choose to take the knee over these games, which follows the approach the Lionesses took in the summer. 

"We have always been player led and we support each individual choice in how they mark the occasion in a way that feels right for them."

England stopped taking the knee at Euro 2025 after defender Jess Carter revealed she had been targeted with racist abuse on social media throughout the tournament.

The Lionesses stood before kick-off rather than taking the knee, with the substitutes standing arm-in-arm on the touchline in a show of solidarity with Carter.

Speaking about Spurs' decision not to take the knee, Tottenham striker England said: "This is not a tick box - this is people's lives, people's feelings. It needs to change.

"We will wear T-shirts during the warm-up which carry our message. This is our way of making a stand that this isn't acceptable, we stand with those who are still being subjected to such horrific abuse.

"We stand together against racism."

Naz said she was "done being quiet" after she was the target of racial abuse following Tottenham's penalty shootout victory over Aston Villa in the Women's League Cup on 24 September.

Spurs head coach Martin Ho said he had a "lot of empathy" for the 25-year-old and that she is being supported by the club.

"Jess is good. She is the same character - a bright personality with a smile on her face, enjoying what she does. She's got a good group of players and staff around her and a wonderful club that gives her that support," he said on Friday.

"We have to make sure we keep pushing as a collective to put things right."

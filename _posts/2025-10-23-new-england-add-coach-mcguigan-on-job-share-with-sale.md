Hereâ€™s what you need to know: McGuigan was part of an England coaching set-up that won back-to-back Tests away to Argentina in the absence of a raft of a British and Irish Lions

Sale coach Byron McGuigan will join England's coaching staff as part of a job share until the end of the season.

Former Scotland wing McGuigan, who oversees Sale's defence, will concentrate on the contact area and working with the back three on skills and tactics when on England duty.

McGuigan, along with Bath attack coach Lee Blackett, was seconded to England for their successful tour of Argentina and the United States earlier this year.

Both McGuigan and Blackett are now part of a rejigged England set-up with Blackett having stepped into the attack role full-time, Richard Wigglesworth switching to defence and Joe El-Abd working with the forwards.

"Byron is a knowledgeable and driven coach with a real passion for improving players," said England head coach Steve Borthwick.

"He has an excellent understanding of the game, both as an international player and now as a coach. I'm looking forward to the impact he'll make during the autumn."

"It was a huge privilege to be involved during the summer, and I'm excited to be back to contribute to the team," said McGuigan.

"I'm very grateful to Sale for supporting me in taking on this opportunity alongside my club role. It's a fantastic chance to continue developing as a coach while contributing to both teams."

While England's recruitment of head of performance Phil Morrow was delayed last season after an initial proposal to split his time between the national team and Saracens was rejected by other top-flight clubs, McGuigan's arrangement is more straightforward.

Unlike Morrow, who has influence over medical treatment and selection issues for England's centrally-contracted players, McGuigan coaching role is seen as a development opportunity without any potential conflict of interest.

McGuigan retired as a player in 2023 after seven seasons and more than 100 appearances for Sale, and only became their defence coach in November.

"Byron is a coach who is so recently removed from playing that he's able to tap into the emotions of the players and understand what they're feeling," said Sale director of rugby Alex Sanderson.

"He can inspire intent from the players because it's only been a couple of years since he was at the coal face himself.

"He inspires the lads to want to put their bodies on the line but layered on to that, his game intelligence, his rugby IQ and his understanding of defensive shape, particularly in the wider channels, is excellent. "

Born in Namibia and brought up in South Africa, McGuigan won 10 caps for Scotland, who he qualified for through his mother, scoring three Test tries.

England take on Australia on 1 November before Tests against Fiji, New Zealand and Argentina complete their autumn campaign.

Here’s what you need to know: Northern Ireland were in the World Cup of Darts final for the first time

Northern Ireland won the World Cup of Darts for the first time with an epic victory over Wales in a final-leg decider.

Daryl Gurney and Josh Rock were in tears after overcoming two-time champions Gerwyn Price and Jonny Clayton 10-9 in Frankfurt.

The winning pair, playing together for the first time, picked up a team first prize of Â£80,000 after keeping their composure despite missing four tournament darts.

"Me and Daryl said when we team up for the World Cup, we'll win it and we did. We've won for our country, we've made history," said Rock, 24.

Gurney, 39, said: "Josh's power scoring was amazing and I was there to clean up the finishing. I've never been so proud of this man and myself."

Clayton, fifth in the PDC's Order of Merit, and Price, who is 11th, held the rankings advantage over the 17th-ranked Rock and Gurney (25th).

But Northern Ireland started brighter and Rock missed two attempts at a double which would have put them 4-1 ahead, before Clayton checked out on 142 to level the match at 3-3.

The Welsh duo pushed ahead to lead 7-5 but their opponents rallied to win the next four legs.

They missed four attempts to clinch the trophy and Wales levelled at 9-9, but Northern Ireland threw first in the decider and Gurney nailed double eight in an 11-dart leg to seal victory.

The 2020 and 2023 champions Wales had fought back against the Dutch pair Danny Noppert and Gian van Veen to win 8-5 in their semi-final.

After four titles in the first eight editions of the tournament, the Netherlands had high hopes of a first triumph since Michael van Gerwen and Raymond van Barneveld's 2018 success.

The Dutch opened up a 4-2 lead on Wales before being pegged back to 5-5 after missed doubles from Noppert and it proved a turning point, with Price sealing victory in style by hitting double 20 twice.

Northern Ireland reached the final with a 8-1 demolition of hosts Germany, who had posted a shock last-16 victory on Saturday over the English pre-tournament Luke Littler and Luke Humphries.

Gurney averaged 105 as Martin Schindler and Ricardo Pietreczko were beaten.

Northern Ireland started Sunday with a comeback victory over the Republic of Ireland, represented by Keane Barry and Willie O'Connor, in their last-eight tie.

Barry and O'Connor were 5-4 up before Rock and Gurney reeled off four consecutive legs to secure an 8-5 victory.

"It was a fantastic game and a great advert for Irish darts," said former World Grand Prix winner Gurney. "Big credit to Keane and Willie - it takes four to make a great game."

Germany beat 2022 champions Australia in a decider after Australia's Damon Heta missed a match dart at double top in the penultimate leg.

Schindler confirmed the host nation's place in the last four with his first attempt at double 12.

Wales posted a three-dart average of 99.66 in their 8-4 win against Hong Kong.

The Dutch had not lost a leg in their first three matches in Frankfurt, including an 8-0 thrashing of Scotland in the last 16.

A streak of 16 consecutive legs won was ended when Czech pair Karel Sedlacek and Petr Krivka broke throw in the opening leg of the quarter-final, but the Dutch duo won eight of the next nine legs to complete another convincing victory.

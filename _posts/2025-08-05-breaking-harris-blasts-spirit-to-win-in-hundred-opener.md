Scorecard. Table

Grace Harris hit a stunning unbeaten 89 from 42 balls as London Spirit began their title defence with a boundary-laden 17-run win over Oval Invincibles in The Hundred.

The Australian put on 100 with Cordelia Griffith, who made 50 from 29 balls, as Spirit posted 176-5 - their highest total in the women's competition - at Lord's.

Facing a daunting chase, Invincibles lost captain Lauren Winfield-Hill second ball but regrouped with former Australia skipper Meg Lanning leading the charge.

Despite a 77-run third-wicket stand with Marizanne Kapp and Lanning's stunning 85 from 51 balls giving them a glimmer of hope, Invincibles came up just short on 159-4.

The 15 sixes in the match were a record for the women's tournament, Harris' antics gave Spirit an 8-7 edge in that category but, more importantly, the win in the season opener.

London Spirit's Grace Harris smashed six of a record 15 sixes in the match

Harris came in 28 balls into the innings with Spirit 40-2 and Griffith having already showing plenty of positive intent.

The 31-year-old, back with Spirit after a previous stint in 2023, soon joined in - clubbing Australia team-mate Amanda-Jade Wellington for six fourth ball.

She continued to attack Wellington but that almost proved her downfall as she offered a chance at long-off on 22 but the catch went down - an error duly punished by Harris.

The half-century came up from 28 balls - Spirit's second quickest in The Hundred - and while Griffith fell the ball after matching that feat, Harris powered on.

Back-to-back sixes off Sophia Smale followed and Tash Farrant - who claimed two wickets on her return to the franchise tournament after injury ruled her out of the past three editions - received the same treatment.

Invincibles managed to keep her off strike late in the innings to deny Harris the chance of a century but her six sixes equalled the competition record for an individual innings and took Spirit to a formidable total.

For much of the chase it looked as though Spirit would defend the runs with ease but a magnificent knock from Lanning, assisted by Kapp, kept it interesting.

Even after Issy Wong bowled Kapp with a fine yorker, Lanning kept going and hit a series of towering sixes over the leg side.

But with seven balls remaining, the 33-year-old fell attempting to add her sixth maximum - England's Wong again with the crucial wicket - and Spirit could breathe that bit easier as they saw out the game.

It's up to Old Trafford on Wednesday as Manchester Originals take on Southern Brave in another double-header.

Here’s what you need to know: Darrell Clarke walked onto the pitch to clap the home fans at full-time after losing to Swindon 

Bristol Rovers have sacked manager Darrell Clarke after 10 straight defeats in League Two saw them slip into the relegation zone.

The latest came on Saturday as the Gas were thrashed 3-0 at home by neighbours Swindon in the M4 derby, leaving them 23rd in the table, trailing Harrogate on goal difference.

Clarke, who led Rovers to successive promotions in his first spell in charge in 2015 and 2016, has failed to stem the tide after the club was relegated from League One last season. 

He said before the Swindon match that he understood that not winning games as a manager meant you would get sacked, but that he was not "a quitter". 

His assistant Jon Stead has also been relieved of his duties.

"The club would like to place on record our sincere thanks to Darrell and Jon for their hard work and efforts," a Bristol Rovers statement said.

"Darrell's legacy at the club is assured and he will always be warmly welcomed at the Memorial Stadium.

"The process to recruit a successor is under way and the club will be making no further comment at this time."

Swindon win at Bristol Rovers on Holloway return

Rovers were booed off by their fans at full-time following defeat by the Robins, in what was their fifth consecutive home league loss. 

They have the scored just three goals and conceded 27 during their losing run - which stretches back to the first weekend of October - and possess the worst goal difference in the division of -23.

Clarke, 47, was appointed in place of Inigo Calderon in May.

And, after losing the first three league games of the season, he seemed to have worked similar magic to his first spell in charge with a run of five wins and two draws that led them towards the play-off places.

That proved to be a false dawn in October, when a narrow defeat at leaders Walsall, where they led at half-time, began their unwanted run of defeats, including 4-0 hammerings by Milton Keynes Dons, at home, and Crawley Town and Barnet away.

Clarke led Bristol Rovers to two promotions during his first spell but his return has been difficult

Clarke also led Port Vale to League Two play-off success in 2022 but he lost his previous job, at Barnsley, last season after a poor run of form.

His departure also means the Gas are searching for a fifth permanent manager in just over two years since the Kuwait-based AlSaeed family purchased a controlling stake in the club from previous owner Wael Al-Qadi.

Speaking at the end of November prior to their 1-0 defeat by Notts County, Clarke said he had the backing of the club's owners, but patience has run out.

Supporters also made their feelings known towards the ownership during the Swindon defeat, unfurling a banner in the South Stand reading "speak up or sell up" with reference to the lack of communication from the club hierarchy. 

Posters bearing the same message have also been placed on lamp posts in the streets around the Memorial Stadium.

The departure of Darrell Clarke is sad but inevitable. 

Sad because he's a club legend for what he achieved in his first spell in charge, but despite the genuine excitement of his return in the summer he has been unable to stop a sinking ship from plumbing new depths.

And inevitable because 10 successive league defeats is a club record. 

Rovers have been hampered by injuries - but they have the worst goal difference in League Two - scoring 15 goals and conceding 38.

But, on reflection, it would appear the problems at Bristol Rovers are deeper rooted than the head coach.

Recruitment in recent transfer windows will be questioned, while supporters are becoming increasingly frustrated and concerned about the lack of communication and leadership from the club owners.

Now the Gas are searching for another head coach, with relegation to the National League a very real threat heading into 2026.

Let's dive into the details: Mark Wood has taken 119 wickets in 38 Tests for England

Fast bowler Mark Wood has been ruled out of England's Ashes tour and replaced in the squad by Matthew Fisher.

Wood only returned to action in the first Test in Perth after eight months out following knee surgery.

The 35-year-old subsequently suffered swelling in the same left knee and was forced to miss the second Test.

England were initially hopeful he could play a part in the remaining three Tests, but the Durham man is now due to go home at the weekend.

"Gutted to be out the remainder of the Ashes," wrote Wood in a post on Instagram.

"After extensive surgery and months of work and rehab to get back into the Test arena, my knee just hasn't held up.

"None of us expected this. I came here with high expectations about making a big impact. I'm desperately disappointed that despite yet more injections and intensive medical treatment it has become clear that the flare up in my knee is worse than feared.

"I'm really sorry that has left me unable to perform as expected but it is not for want of trying."

However, he said he will attempt to make another comeback.

"Whatever happens I will continue to push the limits to get back again," Wood added. "It has been a tough road these past few months but I remain determined to give it another proper go.

"I still believe we can turn things around. Never give in. Come on England."

Who is Matthew Fisher and could he play in the third Test?

It is a huge blow to the tourists - who are already 2-0 down - and to Wood, whose international future is now in doubt.

One of the fastest bowlers to ever play for England, Wood has taken 119 wickets in 38 Tests since making his debut in 2015.

He was part of the team that won the Ashes in 2015, lifted the 2019 50-over World Cup and was in the England squad that won the T20 World Cup in 2022.

His career has been blighted by injuries and the Perth Test was the end of a 15-month absence from Test cricket, firstly because of an elbow injury, then the knee problem.

Wood bowled 11 overs at Perth Stadium, without taking a wicket. He has travelled with the rest of the England squad to their mid-series break in Noosa, but will not be part of the group for the third Test in Adelaide, beginning on 17 December (23:30 16 December GMT).

Surrey's Fisher, 28, won his only Test cap on a tour of the West Indies in 2022. He has been part of the England Lions squad on their tour of Australia.

Considered adept at bowling with the Kookaburra ball used in Australia, Fisher gets the nod ahead of Josh Hull.

Sonny Baker and Tom Lawes would have been other options, but both were ruled out of the Lions squad with injuries.

Meanwhile, Australia's Josh Hazlewood has also been ruled out of the remainder of the series.

Hazlewood, 34, initially missed the first two Tests with a hamstring problem and has now suffered an Achilles tendon setback.

However, Australia coach Andrew McDonald confirmed captain Pat Cummins is set to make his comeback when the hosts reveal their squad for the third Test on Wednesday.

With Cummins due to return from a back problem and off-spinner Nathan Lyon likely to play in Adelaide after being left out of the day-night in Brisbane, Australia will make at least two changes to their team.

Seamers Michael Neser and Brendan Doggett are the candidates to be left out.

Australia could also recall batter Usman Khawaja after the opener struggled in the first Test with a back injury, then missed the second.

McDonald said Khawaja could return at number five, leaving a new opening partnership of Travis Head and Jake Weatherald intact.

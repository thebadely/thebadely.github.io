Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Wing Josh Adams (left) will work under his former Cardiff boss Matt Sherratt (right) with Wales

Wing Josh Adams believes Cardiff's loss is Wales' gain after "fantastic" Matt Sherratt's appointment to the national management team.

The Blue and Blacks start a new era on Saturday when they host Lions (19:45 BST) in the opening round of the United Rugby Championship (URC).

Assistants Corniel Van Zyl, Gethin Jenkins, Jonny Goodridge and Scott Andrews will have greater responsibility after head coach Sherratt left the Arms Park to become Wales' attack coach.

He has become a full-time member of head coach Steve Tandy's staff after being caretaker boss in the Six Nations and on the summer tour to Japan.

Cardiff wing Adams, who has 63 Wales caps and played in the third Test for the British and Irish Lions against South Africa in 2021, has given the appointment his seal of approval.

"As a squad I guess we were expecting it. He was the main candidate for the job after the summer and Six Nations," said Adams, who joined Cardiff from Worcester in 2019 and signed a new deal in April.

"We are just pleased for him, I certainly am. As a player you want to progress to higher honours and it's no different for a coach.

"He is a fantastic coach, one of the best I have worked with, and Wales have made a terrific appointment."

Sherratt returned to Cardiff for a second spell as backs coach in 2021 and was appointed as successor to Dai Young two years later.

He guided the club to a 10th-placed finish in 2024 and last season they came ninth, missing out on the play-offs by a point despite the club enduring the turmoil of administration and a Welsh Rugby Union takeover.

"I know the amount of emotional energy he has put into improving this place and fighting for the club," said Adams.

"Whenever there were board meetings or meetings with the union, he always fought hard for what he though was best for the club and Cardiff.

"We have benefited massively from having him in the role because the place is far better now than it was when he took over as head coach.

"He's done a terrific job and I am glad he is national attack coach, because Wales will benefit from that."

Sherratt's departure was confirmed on Monday, just six days before the URC opener against Lions.

Adams is confident that the loss of the head coach will not hit Cardiff's hopes of improving on last season.

"He made a conscious effort to improve our training days and habits," said Adams.

"It takes a while to break a bad habit and create a new one. What he has implemented is here to stay and there is a great group of senior players who hold everybody accountable to those standards.

"The foundations that he has laid are solid and I wouldn't say that any hard work will be undone because he has moved on."

Adams says forwards coach Van Zyl has stepped in "seamlessly" as Cardiff hunt a successful first block of the URC in which they face Lions, Connacht and Edinburgh at home and Munster and Dragons away.

They open up against a Lions side who finished 11th last season and were runners-up in South Africa's Currie Cup.

"The Lions are a team that graft hard for each other, that's evident when you watch them," said Adams.

"They don't have the superstars of the South African franchises but they are a tough side and we will have to be close to our best to get something from the game."

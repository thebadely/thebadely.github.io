Let's dive into the details: Jack McMillan won Olympic gold as part of GB's 4x200m freestyle team at Paris 2024

Great Britain finished third at the European Short Course Swimming Championships after Jack McMillan, Duncan Scott and Lauren Cox won golds in Lublin.

The 17-strong British team which travelled to Poland finished with a total of 11 medals after six days of competition.

McMillan claimed the men's 400m freestyle title, before finishing second to team-mate Scott in the men's 200m freestyle final.

"Coming into this I was in really good shape. But to actually do it on the stage, on the day, is very special," McMillan said.

"It just gives me more confidence, the training I am doing is clearly working, so that's good to know at the start of this block heading towards the 2028 Olympic Games."

Cox triumphed in the women's 100m backstroke as Britain finished with three golds - only table-toppers Italy (nine) and the Netherlands (seven) amassed more.

Freya Colbert, 21, contributed two medals with her third-place finishes in the women's 200m and 400m freestyle events.

Meanwhile, Ellen Walshe became the first Irish woman to win gold at the championships as she won a thrilling 200m butterfly final.

Great Britain topped the medal table at the previous staging of the championships in 2023, with nine golds and a total medal haul of 23.

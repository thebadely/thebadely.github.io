According to new developments, A man has died after falling from a height at an Oasis concert on Saturday, the Metropolitan Police has said.

Police said officers and medics at Wembley Stadium in London responded to reports that a man in his 40s had been injured at 22:19 BST. 

The man "was found with injuries consistent with a fall" and was pronounced dead at the scene, a spokesperson for the force said. 

Oasis said in a statement they were "shocked and saddened" to hear of the death of a fan.

They added: "Oasis would like to extend our sincere condolences to the family and friends of the person involved."

The man reportedly fell from an upper tier. 

Police said the stadium was busy and they "believe it is likely a number of people witnessed the incident, or may knowingly or unknowingly have caught it on mobile phone video footage". 

The Met has asked anyone who may have information to get in touch via 101.

It added that the investigation would be passed to the Health and Safety Executive in the next few days.

Oasis's performance was scheduled to begin at 20:15 and end at 22:15, according to timings on Wembley Stadium's website.

On Sunday, the band dedicated Live Forever to everyone "who can't be here".

Liam Gallagher told fans: "This one's for all the people who can't be here tonight, but who are here if you know what I mean, and aren't they looking lovely. Live Forever."

The band began the Oasis Live '25 reunion tour in July. Saturday's concert was part of seven sold-out reunion concerts at Wembley Stadium, which has a 90,000-person capacity across three tiers. 

Noel and Liam Gallagher are marking the end of an almost 16-year split with their tour.

Wembley Stadium said in a statement that medics, police and the London Ambulance service had attended to the injured man. 

"Despite their efforts, the fan very sadly died.  Our thoughts go out to his family, who have been informed and are being supported by specially trained police officers," it said. 

The band will next appear in Edinburgh for three gigs on 8, 9 and 12 August and then take their tour to Ireland, Canada, the US and Mexico before returning to Wembley on 27 and 28 September.

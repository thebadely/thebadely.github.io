Dramatic draw against Australia keeps USA quarter final hopes alive

Women's Rugby World Cup - Pool A

USA (5) 31

Tries: Tafuna 3, Sagapolu, Jarrell-Searcy Cons: Hawkins 3

Australia (14) 31

Tries: Miller 2, Halse 2, Karpani Cons: Wood 3

The USA and Australia produced the game of the Women's Rugby World Cup so far as they drew a Pool A thriller that leaves both teams still in with a chance of making the quarter-finals.

Australia led 14-5 at half-time in York thanks to tries from their dynamic backs Desiree Miller and Caitlyn Halse.

USA flanker Freda Tafuna crossed for the first of a hat-trick of tries but McKenzie Hawkins failed to add the conversion after taking too long over her kick.

Prop Keia Mae Sagapolu and player of the match Tafuna scored in quick succession as the Eagles fought back to lead early in a pulsating second half.

Rapid left wing Miller, with her fifth try in two games, and a second excellent finish from 18-year-old full-back Halse helped Australia open up a 26-17 lead.

Tafuna completed her hat-trick with another powerful finish from close range, and two minutes later lock Erica Jarrell-Searcy put the USA in front for a second time, sparking jubilant celebrations before Hawkins' attempted conversion kick bounced off both posts and fell short.

The Wallaroos responded yet again with a try from prop Eva Karpani that brought the scores level with five minutes to play.

Jo Yapp's side would have snatched victory and a place in the quarter-finals but Samantha Wood missed a relatively simple conversion attempt as the match finished all square.

Both teams picked up three points from the game - two for the draw and an extra point for securing a try bonus - to leave both in with a chance of reaching the knockout stage.

Australia have eight points from two games to the USA's three. 

The Wallaroos face World Cup favourites England in their final match in Brighton on Saturday, knowing a bonus point would clinch their place in the last eight.

Given England's impressive form that might prove beyond Australia, leaving Yapp's side relying on points difference to go through as runners-up.

If Australia lose heavily, the USA could qualify if they secure a big bonus-point win over Samoa that enables them to overhaul the massive 135 points difference between the teams.

Sione Fukofuka's side play first next Saturday and could put extra pressure on Australia with a commanding win in York.

England booked their place in the quarter-finals earlier on Saturday with a record 92-3 victory over Samoa in Northampton.

USA star player Ilona Maher said she was proud of the team's fighting spirit as well as the entertainment the teams provided, but felt they should have won.

"The mood is disappointment because we were so close," she said. "But also excitement because there is more to play for in that we're not going home just yet.

"We're definitely proud of the fight. We were in it the whole time. We had ourselves a game, it was exciting to watch, exciting for people in the stands and watching at home.

"I just know that it was really good rugby, even with the conditions. It was super wet out there."

Australia head coach Yapp described her emotions as "a bit disappointed, a bit flat" after missing out on victory.

"We let them into the game in that second half and our penalty count allowed them access to our half, and when they're in there, they're hard to stop," Yapp said.

"Ultimately our discipline really let us down. At times, we weren't accurate with our launch plays as well. We'll always reflect and look to bounce back - the girls have got a big game next week."

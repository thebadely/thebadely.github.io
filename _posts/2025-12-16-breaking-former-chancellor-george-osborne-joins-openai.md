Experts revealed that Former chancellor George Osborne is joining artificial intelligence (AI) giant OpenAI.

He will lead its "OpenAI for Countries" programme, which is aimed at helping governments increase their AI capacity.

Announcing his new London-based role, Osborne said it was a privilege to be joining the company.

"I recently asked myself the question: what's the most exciting and promising company in the world right now? The answer I believe is OpenAI," he said on X.

The announcement follows news that government-level negotiations between the UK and the US over a tech deal that included greater co-operation in AI have faltered.

OpenAI's chief global affairs officer Chris Lehane said Osborne's decision to join the company reflected "a shared belief that AI is becoming critical infrastructure – and early decisions about how it's built, governed, and deployed will shape economics and geopolitics for years to come."

OpenAI for Countries is designed to work with governments "to ensure that global AI systems are built on democratic values", Mr Lehane wrote on LinkedIn. So far the programme has engaged with more than 50 countries.

He said Osborne will work with governments to help develop AI infrastructure, build AI literacy and use AI to improve public services.

"In his new role, George will help to expand existing partnerships and build new ones," Mr Lehane added.

Osborne, who co-hosts a podcast and is also chair of the British Museum, said he joined the firm after conversations with OpenAI's chief executive Sam Altman and chief operating officer Brad Lightcap. 

He said the pair are "exceptionally impressive leaders and that they care very deeply about their mission to ensure the power of artificial intelligence is developed responsibly, and the benefits are felt by all". 

Osborne added: "That's exactly what the OpenAI for Countries initiative intends to achieve, helping societies around the world share the opportunity this powerful technology brings."

Osborne said he was leaving his current role at investment bank Evercore, which was a "huge wrench".

He was also previously editor of the Evening Standard newspaper from 2017 to 2020.

Osborne's new job was first reported by the Financial Times.

The announcement comes as Downing Street insisted it remained in active conversation with the US government over a major tech deal.

The deal, unveiled in September, included £31bn in planned spending from tech giants including Nvidia and Google.

But reports emerged that "broader disagreements" between the US and UK had stalled negotiations.

Osborne's appointment also comes amid a boom in AI investment - and growing jitters of a potential AI market bubble.

Earlier this month the Bank of England warned of a potential "sharp correction" in the value of major tech companies, adding growth in the AI sector would be fuelled by trillions of dollars in debt over the next five years.

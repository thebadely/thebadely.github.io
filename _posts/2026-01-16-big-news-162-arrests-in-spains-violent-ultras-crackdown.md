Here’s what you need to know: Police in Spain say they recovered material hidden in bushes that would have been used to attack rival groups

Spanish police say they have "neutralised" dozens of arranged meetings between groups of violent football ultras this season.

The National Police announced they have made 162 arrests of individuals linked to radical football groups so far in the 2025-26 campaign.

They say they have stopped "numerous planned clashes" between rival sets of ultras, including an interception of a planned clash involving Atletico Madrid and Sevilla groups in early November.

The National Police say they recovered "material hidden in bushes" that would have allegedly been used to attack rival groups.

Another example provided was of 14 individuals being arrested before an alleged planned "meet-up" between ultras from city rivals Sevilla and Real Betis, prior to the two teams playing in La Liga.

The 162 arrests have come as part of 15 operations across Spain throughout the season.

Police said they had "a policy of 'zero tolerance' against extremist and violent behaviour".

"Most of the detainees are involved in crimes of tumultuous brawl, public disorder, injuries and belonging to a criminal group," they added.

"The predominant profile of the detainees corresponds to men, between 18 and 40 years old, with previous records in crimes related to public order, and linked to radical factions of different ideologies."

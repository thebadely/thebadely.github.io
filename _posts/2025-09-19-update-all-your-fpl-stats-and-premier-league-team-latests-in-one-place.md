Premier League predictions 2025-26: BBC Sport pundits pick their top four

What's new in the Premier League this season?

Sutton's predictions v The Coral, Starsailor, Picture Parlour & AI

Liverpool head coach Arne Slot was tight-lipped on whether Alexander Isak, who made his debut against Atletico Madrid in midweek, will start in the Merseyside derby.

"All I know is Alex probably felt his body more than ever before after the 60 minutes he played so let's see how he recovered today then we will see about the line-up," he said on Friday.

Curtis Jones is back in contention, having missed the wins over Burnley and Atletico Madrid with injury.

Everton boss David Moyes says defenders Jarrad Branthwaite and Vitalii Mykolenko are "making progress" from their respective injuries.

Branthwaite hasn't played yet this season due to a hamstring injury while Mykolenko has a groin issue.

"They are making progress and we'll see. We've got a couple of other knocks within the camp but we'll see how they are, " said Moyes.

Doubts: Everton - Vitali Mykolenko, Jarrad Branthwaite 

Key FPL notes:

Despite starting at right-back for the third match in a row, Dominik Szoboszlai (Â£6.5m) still managed to rack up more shots (six) last weekend than any other Premier League player.

Mohamed Salah's (Â£14.5m) late penalty against Burnley in Gameweek 4 was a landmark goal for several reasons; not only did it take him to outright fourth on the all-time Premier League scoring leaderboard, with 188 goals, but it was also the Egyptian star's first league match-winner for Liverpool in the 90th-minute or later.

Everton's Jack Grealish (Â£6.8m) created a joint-high five chances last weekend, as well as registering more touches in the opposition's penalty area (19) than any other Premier League player.

Brighton's Jack Hinshelwood, who picked up an ankle ligament problem in the defeat by Bournemouth last weekend, faces a prolonged spell on the sidelines.

Maxim De Cuyper, who went off with a knee injury in that match, will be given a late fitness test.

Mats Wieffer is fit again after a minor knee issue.

Tottenham's Dominic Solanke remains out with an ankle injury but is back in training, head coach Thomas Frank has revealed.

Summer signing Kota Takai will also return to training next week after a foot injury.

Players out: Brighton - Jack Hinshelwood, Solly March, Adam Webster

Players out: Tottenham - Dominic Solanke, Kota Takai, James Maddison, Dejan Kulusevski, Radu Dragusin, Yves Bissouma 

Doubts: Brighton - Maxim De Cuyper 

Key FPL notes:

Yankuba Minteh (Â£5.9m) finally delivered on his promising underlying stats last weekend, registering a first assist of the season with a well-placed cross for Brighton against Bournemouth.

The pacey midfielder was central to much of the Seagulls' threat, having three shots of his own from inside the box.

Tottenham have kept an impressive four clean sheets in their last five matches in all competitions, including a midweek Champions League win over Villarreal. A lot of that is thanks to Guglielmo Vicario (Â£5.1m), who has made at least four saves in every league match so far.

Xavi Simons (Â£7.0m) registered a first assist for his new club in the league last weekend, with one of his seven crosses.

Burnley midfielder Lesley Ugochukwu is suspended after his red card against Liverpool last weekend.

Nottingham Forest defender Murillo will be given a late fitness test after limping off in the defeat by Arsenal last weekend.

Nicolas Dominguez remains sidelined after knee surgery but should return to full training next week.

Players out: Burnley - Lesley Ugochukwu, Jordan Beyer, Connor Roberts, Zeki Amdouni

Players out: Nottingham Forest - Ola Aina, Nicolas Dominguez

Doubts: Burnley - Jacob Bruun Larsen 

Doubts: Nottingham Forest - Murillo 

Key FPL notes:

Jaidon Anthony (Â£5.5m) is, impressively, the Premier League's third-highest performer for non-penalty expected goal involvement (NPxGI) so far. The Burnley winger blanked in Gameweek 4 but has two goals and an assist to his name.

Elliot Anderson (Â£5.5m) put in another strong display for Forest last weekend despite the Tricky Trees losing to Arsenal, registering a season-high 15 defensive contributions.

The only Forest player to register more touches in the final-third against Arsenal than Anderson was Dan Ndoye (Â£6.1m), who managed 23 in that match. None of the tricky Swiss winger's teammates have had more touches in the penalty box this season than his 13, either, with Ndoye currently his team's joint leader for attacking returns (two).

West Ham's Tomas Soucek is suspended and could be replaced by French midfielder Soungoutou Magassa, who made his Hammers debut as a second-half replacement against Tottenham last weekend.

Aaron Wan-Bissaka will miss out again with a stomach problem.

Callum Wilson, whose five appearances this season have all come from the bench, could make his first West Ham start.

Niclas Fullkrug, who suffered a calf injury during the international break, could make his return after being an unused substitute last weekend.

Crystal Palace welcome Adam Wharton and Eddie Nketiah back into the squad, with the former "ready to start" according to manager Oliver Glasner.

Back-up goalkeeper Walter Benitez is out after dislocating a finger in the midweek penalty shootout win over Millwall.

Players out: West Ham - Tomas Soucek, Aaron Wan-Bissaka 

Players out: Crystal Palace - Walter Benitez, Ismaila Sarr, Chadi Riad, Cheick Doucoure

Key FPL notes:

Jarrod Bowen (Â£7.7m) has attempted 10 shots in West Ham's first four matches, at least four more than any other teammate.

James Ward-Prowse (Â£5.9m) has been West Ham's key creator this season, having racked up 10 key passes in 317 minutes of football.

Jean-Philippe Mateta (Â£7.6m) has accrued the second-most shots on target (six) across the league this season.

Leeds goalkeeper Lucas Perri remains sidelined, with Karl Darlow again set to deputise.

Daniel James is a doubt with a muscle problem while Wilfried Gnonto is battling with a calf issue.

Wolves forward Jorgen Strand Larsen, who hasn't played for almost a month with an Achilles problem, is back in training and could feature but will not play for 90 minutes.

Head coach Vitor Pereira has no other injury worries.

Players out: Leeds - Lucas Perri

Doubts: Leeds - Daniel James, Wilfried Gnonto

Doubts: Wolves - Jorgen Strand Larsen 

Key FPL notes:

Rodrigo Gomes' (Â£4.5m) six shots are the most of any Wolves player in 2025-26 so far. 

Anton Stach (Â£5.0m) has fired off 10 shots and created 11 chances this season, the most of any Leeds asset. That makes Stach the only Premier League player to reach double figures for both metrics so far.

Joe Rodon (Â£4.0m) is Leeds' leading player for FPL points (20) and defensive contributions (39) over the first four Gameweeks.

Manchester United's Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha are fit to return, after missing last week's derby defeat with injury.

Diogo Dalot remains out after picking up an injury on international duty with Portugal, and Lisandro Martinez is also still sidelined as he recovers from knee surgery.

Chelsea's Cole Palmer is fit to face Manchester United after fears that he might have suffered a groin injury in Wednesday's Champions League defeat to Bayern Munich.

Several other players will be assessed after Friday's training session.

"We haven't had a session since the game on Wednesday, we have some doubts but we will see after today's training session," said head coach Enzo Maresca.

Maresca said that former United player Alejandro Garnacho "is ready to start" after two appearances as a substitute.

Players out: Man Utd - Diogo Dalot, Lisandro Martinez

Players out: Chelsea - Levi Colwill, Liam Delap, Dario Essugo, Mykhailo Mudryk

Doubts: Chelsea - Benoit Badiashile, Romeo Lavia

Key FPL notes:

Reinstated to Manchester United's line-up in Gameweek 4 following his benching in the previous league match, Patrick Dorgu (Â£4.5m) created more chances (three) against Manchester City than any of his Red Devils team-mates.

Against Brentford in Gameweek 4, Cole Palmer (Â£10.4m) netted his first Premier League goal from open play since January. Chelsea's talismanic attacker, who came off the bench just minutes earlier as he continues to recover from a groin injury, managed five shots in 41 minutes against the Bees, three of them from inside the box.

Joao Pedro (Â£7.8m) has the Premier League's joint-highest tally of attacking returns after the first four rounds of matches, with five (two goals, three assists).

Fulham have no fresh injury concerns

Alex Iwobi picked up a knock in the victory over Leeds last Saturday but is back in training and avaialable for selection.

Brentford's Kristoffer Ajer, who came off against Aston Villa in midweek as a precaution after taking a blow to the knee, will be fit to face Fulham.

Paris Maghoma and Gustavo Nunes are building towards full fitness after hamstring injuries but remain sidelined.

Players out: Brentford - Paris Maghoma, Gustavo Nunes

Key FPL notes:

Sasa Lukic (Â£5.0m) has created seven chances across Fulham's first four matches, at least three more than any other teammate.

Brentford right-back Michael Kayode (Â£4.5m) has a growing reputation for long throw-ins, having peppered yet another opponent - Chelsea - with them last weekend in a match that eventually was tied following a similar effort by a teammate; suggesting the tactic will remain a key aspect of the Bees' game plan in the future.

Speaking of Brentford's late equaliser versus the Blues last weekend, it was Kevin Schade (Â£7.0m) who flung in that particular long throw leading to Fabio Carvalho's (Â£4.9m) goal. Benefitting from a formation tweak that saw him deployed in a front two, the German forward had already scored a goal of his own in Saturday's London derby with one of his four shots in the box, his highest single-match tally of the campaign.

Bournemouth midfielder Ryan Christie is fit again after missing last week's win over Brighton.

BafodÃ© DiakitÃ© is also in contention to make his first appearance since the end of August.

Enes Unal and Adam Smith remain sidelined with respective knee and hamstring injuries.

Newcastle new signing Yoane Wissa is likely to to be out until next month with a knee injury.

Anthony Gordon is serving the final game of a three-match suspension.

On striker Nick Woltemade, who started on the bench against Barcelona, manager Eddie Howe said: "We're going to have to look after Nick. It's hard enough for him to come into a new league - you can see the physical effects he felt [against] Wolves - and the quick turnaround in games here."

Players out: Newcastle - Yoane Wissa, Jacob Ramsey, Anthony Gordon

Players out: Bournemouth- Enes Unal, Adam Smith

Key FPL notes:

Apparent penalty-taking duties add another string to Antoine Semenyo's (Â£7.5m) bow. With Justin Kluivert (Â£7.0m) - last season's go-to guy from 12 yards - yet to start a match for Bournemouth in 2025-26, Semenyo stepped up to convert from the spot after crafty teammate Evanilson (Â£7.0m) was felled in the box; it marked the in-form Ghanaian attacker's second goal involvement that afternoon against Brighton and his fifth attacking return (three goals, two assists) in four matches.

Nick Woltemade (Â£7.0m) scored on his Newcastle debut to help his new side beat Wolves last weekend, and could get a run of undisturbed starts up top with fellow newcomer Yoane Wissa (Â£7.5m) ruled out through injury.

Newcastle have been one of the Premier League's most defensively solid sides so far this season, with only Liverpool managing to score against Nick Pope (Â£5.0m) and co thus far. The 33-year-old shot-stopper has kept three clean sheets, two of them away from home, with the Magpies also currently boasting the league's lowest expected goals conceded (xGC), at just 2.09.

Sunderland's Enzo le Fee and Dan Ballard are both available for selection after injury but Luke O'Nien, who has a shoulder injury, remains "a few more weeks away", according to head coach Regis Le Bris.

Aston Villa midfielder Boubacar Kamara could start on Sunday after making his comeback from a hamstring injury against Brentford in midweek.

Victor Lindelof, who picked up a minor injury when making his debut as a late substitute last weekend, is back in training and should be available.

Players out: Sunderland - Luke O'Nien, Leo Hjelde

Players out: Aston Villa - Ross Barkley, Youri Tielemans, Amadou Onana, Andres Garcia

Key FPL notes:

Sunderland have conceded only three goals so far this season, level with the likes of Chelsea and Newcastle and one fewer than both Liverpool and Manchester City. New No 1 goalkeeper Robin Roefs (Â£4.5m) has had a big part to play in that, making a total of 13 saves to help the Black Cats earn two clean sheets from four attempts.

Aston Villa finally scored their first goal of the 2025/26 season, courtesy of deadline day signing Harvey Elliott's (Â£5.4m) effort, in Tuesday's Carabao Cup outing at Brentford.

Villa have at least looked a little better in defence than attack, keeping two clean sheets from their four league matches so far. England international Ezri Konsa (Â£4.5m) had a near-flawless midweek game against the Bees, with 100% passing accuracy, dribbles, long balls and ground duels, and remains an integral part of that solidity.

Arsenal trio Ben White, Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard have a chance of making the game but a late decision will be taken after training on Saturday.

Defender William Saliba is also hoping to return to the matchday line-up but will also have a fitness test at the weekend.

Mikel Merino and Viktor Gyokeres both suffered head injuries in Tuesday's Champions League win over Athletic Club but are fit.

Manchester City will not decide until Sunday whether Rodri will be fit enough to start his third game in a week.

Manager Pep Guardiola said the midfielder "didn't feel comfortable" during training on Wednesday but played "extraordinary" in the Champions League.

Players out: Arsenal - Kai Havertz, Gabriel Jesus

Doubts: Arsenal - Ben White, Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard, William Saliba

Players out: Manchester City - Omar Marmoush, John Stones, Mathis Cherki, Mateo Kovacic 

Doubts: Manchester City - Rodri, Rayan Ait-Nouri

Key FPL notes:

Only Erling Haaland (Â£14.2m) was afforded more big chances last weekend than Viktor Gyokeres (Â£9.0m), who netted his third goal in Arsenal colours to help down Nottingham Forest. The Swedish striker managed eight touches in the penalty box during that match.

Erling Haaland has four goals and two assists in six Premier League appearances against Arsenal, although City have not beaten the Gunners since the 2022/23 campaign.

Starting his first match of the season, Phil Foden (Â£8.0m) headed in City's opener last weekend and was also a workhorse off the ball, registering a match-high 13 defensive contributions.

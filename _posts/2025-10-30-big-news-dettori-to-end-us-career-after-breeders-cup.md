It has been recently reported that Frankie Dettori's career victories include 23 British Classics and over 280 Group One races

Frankie Dettori says he will retire from riding in the United States after the Breeders' Cup in Del Mar, California on Saturday. 

Dettori, 54, first announced plans to retire in 2022 but made a U-turn and switched to riding in the US instead, where he has been based for the past two years. 

Posting on social media, Dettori said he will retire completely after riding in a few races in South America.

"From the bottom of my heart, thank you to everyone who has supported me throughout this incredible journey," he wrote on X., external 

"It has been an honour to compete at the highest level of this sport for over four decades. I'm deeply grateful to my family, the owners, trainers, stable staff, and of course the supporters who have made my career possible." 

The Italian has several rides at the two-day Del Mar meeting, which starts on Friday, with his last set to be on Argine in the Breeders' Cup Mile at 23:05 GMT on Saturday.

Dettori has ridden 15 winners in the Breeders' Cup, with his most recent in 2023 with Inspiral. 

He made his farewell to British racing at Champions Day at Ascot in 2023, sealing a double victory with King Of Steel and Trawlerman.

Dettori, who was awarded an MBE in 2001, rode his maiden winner in Italy in 1986 and his first in Britain a year later, before being crowned champion apprentice in 1989. 

He was British champion on three occasions in 1994, 1995 and 2004, has won 23 British Classics and in 1996 triumphed in all seven races on the card in one day at Ascot. 

In March, he filed for bankruptcy having been unable to reach agreement with His Majesty's Revenue and Customs over a long-running case of tax avoidance.

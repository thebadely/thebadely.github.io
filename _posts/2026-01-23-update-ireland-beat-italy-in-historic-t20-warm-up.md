Matthew Humphreys took 4-16 as Ireland defeated Italy in the first of three T20 internationals between the sides.

Chasing Italy's 118, Ireland reached their target with three balls and three wickets remaining.

This match in Dubai marked the first time Italy's men have played against an ICC full member nation in a T20 series, and they were put in to bat after Ireland won the toss.

Italy made an impressively strong start, reaching 55-1 in 5.3 overs before losing captain JJ Smuts, who was bowled by Barry McCarthy.

Anthony Mosca was Italy's top scorer, with his 22-ball knock of 35 ended by Humphreys in the seventh over.

The left-arm spinner also dismissed Grant Stewart, Marcus Campopiano and Jaspreet Singh - the latter two from consecutive balls in the 15th over - while Mark Adair claimed the final wicket of Crishan Kalugamage as Italy were bowled out in 18.1 overs.

Despite losing opener Paul Stirling to a second-ball duck and Ross Adair for 12, Harry Tector's 41 and 34 from Lorcan Tucker put Ireland in a strong position in their reply.

George Dockrell, Gareth Delany and Mark Adair fell cheaply late on, but Ben Calitz and McCarthy helped Ireland over the line.

The three-match series in the United Arab Emirates, which forms part of both teams' preparation for the T20 Cricket World Cup in February, continues on Sunday.

Ireland will face co-hosts Sri Lanka in their World Cup opener on 8 February and will also face Australia, Oman and Zimbabwe in Group B.

First-time qualifiers Italy have Group C matches against Bangladesh, Nepal, England and West Indies.

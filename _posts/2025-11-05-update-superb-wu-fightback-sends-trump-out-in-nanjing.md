Here’s what you need to know: Judd Trump has not won a ranking event since his victory at the UK Championship in December 2024

China's Wu Yize produced a sensational comeback to knock world number one Judd Trump out of the International Championship in Nanjing.

Defending champion Ding Junhui and world number three Neil Robertson also exited the tournament at the last-16 stage on Wednesday.

Ding was beaten 6-2 by 2025 Masters winner Shaun Murphy, while world number 60 Zak Surety - who made a 147 break in his previous match - was a 6-3 winner against Australian Robertson.

Trump, 36, was 4-0 in front at the mid-session interval of his fourth-round match but was limited to only 18 more points as Wu, ranked 22nd in the world, won the next six frames in succession to reach the quarter-finals.

The former English Open and Scottish Open runner-up, 22, made five breaks of 80 or more - including a 109 in the sixth frame - on his way to victory.

Trump has had a mixed start to the season but he reached the final of the Northern Ireland Open in Belfast last month, losing in a deciding frame to fellow Englishman and close friend Jack Lisowski.

However, it is approaching a year since Trump's most recent ranking title at the UK Championship in York in December 2024.

Wu's quarter-final opponent will be England's Barry Hawkins, who ended in-form Lisowski's winning run with a 6-4 success.

Lisowski, who defeated Ronnie O'Sullivan in the third round on Tuesday, knocked in century breaks in three consecutive frames as he fought back from 4-0 behind to draw level with Hawkins.

But the former World Championship runner-up restored his lead with a break of 75 in the ninth frame before confirming his place in the next round.

World champion Zhao Xintong of China and England's four-time Crucible winner Mark Selby will meet in one of the other quarter-finals, following 6-1 wins against China's Si Jiahui and Scotland's Anthony McGill respectively.

Murphy's reward for beating Ding is a quarter-final meeting with John Higgins, who came through a last-frame decider to see off Scott Donaldson 6-5.

Stephen Maguire completed the quarter-final line up by beating home player Jiang Jun 6-4 to set up a clash with Surety.

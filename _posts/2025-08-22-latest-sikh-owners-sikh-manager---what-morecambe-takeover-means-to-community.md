According to new developments, Ashvir Singh Johal is taking up his first managerial position at Morecambe, after previously coaching at Leicester City, Wigan Athletic and Notts County

When Morecambe's takeover by Panjab Warriors was finalised this week, they became the first professional football club in England to be owned by Sikh investors.

Then, when 30-year-old Ashvir Singh Johal was hired in place of former manager Derek Adams, he became the first Sikh boss of a professional British club.

With around half a million Sikhs in the UK, and a further 25 to 30 million around the world, many eyes are now turning to a small seaside town in the north-west of England.

BBC Sport spoke to Panjab Warriors, Sikhs in football, and an expert to explore what these breakthroughs mean to a community that has typically been underrepresented in British football.

The clue is in the name - Panjab Warriors are keen to put their identity at the forefront of their work at National League club Morecambe. When they gave their first interview as owners to the BBC this week, the group made clear that they feel the ideals of Sikhism lend themselves to positive ownership in football.

"Punjab, the land of five rivers, is our native land," said Gurpreet Singh, the group's head of communications. "For us, our heritage, our culture and our faith are our core principles. They make us who we are.

"And it is these principles â discipline, trustfulness, compassion - that we want to bring to Morecambe."

Morecambe chief executive Ropinder Singh said: "There is no better marriage than Punjab and football.

"The doors are open for everybody. The idea is that we want to change the narrative that football ownership is an unethical process."

The group members claim they will be able to bring with them fans from across the country and around the world from the Sikh diaspora who share those values.

"People back home in Punjab will be very proud of the fact that Sikhs are running a club here," said Jagbir Jhutti-Johal, professor of Sikh studies at the University of Birmingham.

"I think Sikhs in America, Canada, etc, will be watching closely. And those in the UK, even if they might be fans of Liverpool or Manchester United, will also be rooting for Morecambe.

"I think Panjab Warriors will be held to account by the community, who will be watching and thinking, 'how are they leading this club? Are they really living up to the values and Sikh traditions?'"

Johal has replaced former Morecambe boss Derek Adams, who led the club to the third tier for the first time in their history, in a move which has led to split reactions from fans

Practising Sikh men often make their faith visible by wearing the turban and growing out their beards. The practice of keeping uncut facial hair, as members of the new ownership group do, is a symbol of respect for God's creation.

The clear representation of Sikhs running a professional English club, with a Sikh manager in the dugout, is a source of inspiration for some in the wider community.

"The identity is significant," said Preetam Singh, who founded Stretford Sikhs - Manchester United's first official Sikh supporters' club. It was formed last season with the goal of creating a safe space for Sikh fans.

"Ashvir [Johal] wears a patka [head covering] and has a dadhi [beard], so the clear image of a Sikh is now out there on a big stage. People notice, they ask questions, they learn. Even his name and appearance alone can spark understanding - and that's going to have a massive impact."

The first major wave of Sikh migration to the UK began in the 1950s, after World War Two.

"When the first generation of Sikhs, our parents and grandparents came, their main goal was to work, earn a solid living and get settled within the UK," Jhutti-Johal explained. "They wanted their children to be in professions like medicine and law that would provide them with a livelihood and allow them to better themselves.

"Up until the early 2000s, not many Sikhs really engaged with football. They were fans, yes, but we didn't see them entering into football professions as players, referees or other things.

"However, that second and third generation has grown up and had children, and now if we have talented footballers or artists, we encourage them to do well in those professions and allow them to thrive, and that then increases the visibility of the Sikh community."

Former referee Jarnail Singh is now an assessor in the English Football League

Somebody who has already played a role in increasing Sikh visibility is Jarnail Singh, the first turban-wearing referee in English league football, who received a lifetime achievement award at the Asian Football Awards in 2012.

"For the South Asian community, and especially the Sikh community, I think it's absolutely superb where we actually have broken the glass ceiling in terms of going into management," Singh said in response to Johal's hiring.

"When most Asians walk along the street, you can't say 100% they are Sikhs. But wearing the patka and the turban, it's a sign and saying to everybody, 'yes, I am a proud Sikh'. All I can do is wish him all the best on behalf of myself, the family and the Sikh community out there.

"It just gives everybody the drive to know that one of our Sikhs has reached the pinnacle as a manager, and he'll be a great role model for everybody to follow and say 'don't let the colour of your skin or your religion or how you look stop you from doing what you want to do'."

Johal may not have set out to break down barriers, but his appointment sets an example to Sikhs, South Asians and other underrepresented groups in British football that they can play a significant role.

"At the moment, Ash has got a job to do," said his father Kulvinder. "He's not purposely gone out to be a role model. He is chasing his dream to be a coach.

"This is another milestone in a career that began when he was 15, 16 years old. He has the determination to get to where he wants. It's also his resilience, his focus.

"Ash is a very intellectual individual. He could have been anything in this world and he would have made it a success. He chose coaching. And I think in a few years' time he will be at the pinnacle of where he wants to be.

"If along the way he happens to become a role model for other people in the community, if this allows others to chase their dreams, then that can only be a good thing for the UK as a whole."

Here’s what you need to know: Police are investigating whether a man accused of stabbing 10 people on a train is linked to an attack on a 14-year-old boy and to two reports of a knifeman at a barbers' shop.

Cambridgeshire Police said it was reviewing the incidents following the knife attack on the London-bound LNER train after it passed through Peterborough on Saturday.

On Friday the teenager was stabbed in the city and a man was reported to be at a barbers' shop carrying a knife. The shop made a second report the next day.

Anthony Williams, 32, of no fixed abode, was charged with 10 counts of attempted murder relating to the train stabbing and a count of attempted murder in connection with an attack in London on Saturday.

A man was left with facial injuries following the attack at about 00:45 at a station in Silvertown.

Cambridgeshire Police said in all three incidents a "crime was raised" and investigations launched.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer has praised police, first responders and the "heroic" actions of the driver and the members of staff aboard the train when the "vile and horrific attack" took place. 

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood also paid tribute to the "breathtaking bravery" and "heroic acts of the passengers and train crew who intercepted the attacker".

At about 19:10 on Friday, a 14-year-old was stabbed by a man with a knife in Peterborough city centre.

Police said the victim was treated at Peterborough City Hospital for minor injuries and later discharged.

Cambridgeshire Police said: "The offender had left the scene when the call was made and despite a search of the area by officers and a police dog, the offender was not identified."

Also on Friday evening, a man was seen with a knife at a barbers' shop in the Fletton area of Peterborough.

Police said the incident took place at 19:25, but was reported to officers two hours later at 21:10, by which time the man had left the shop.

Officers were not sent, the force added. 

The same barbers' shop called the police at 09:25 on Saturday to report that a man carrying a knife was at the shop. 

Officers arrived at the site within 18 minutes and searched the area, but were unable to locate or identify the man.

Cambridgeshire Police said: "We are currently reviewing all incidents in the timeframe to understand whether there were any further potential offences.

"British Transport Police retain primacy for the overall investigation, which will include these three incidents."

Cambridgeshire Police referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), as it typical in these cases. 

The IOPC, however, said it would not be investigating the incident as "it did not meet the criteria for a valid referral".

Scunthorpe United footballer Jonathan Gjoshe, 22, and Nottingham Forest fan Stephen Crean were travelling on the LNER train from Doncaster to London King's Cross when they were injured during the attack at about 20:00 GMT.

Mr Gjoshe was slashed across the bicep and had been operated on, his club said.

Mr Crean has been hailed a hero after he confronted the train attacker, going face to face with him in the carriage.

He described how he "tussled" with the man, who was shouting at him as he slashed him on the head and hand.

He said he was determined to confront the attacker to give another passenger time to close the door of the buffet car, where other passengers had gathered. 

In the House of Commons earlier, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: "There's no doubt that their collective action, their brave action, saved countless lives and I know the whole country is grateful for that."

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said earlier that one member of the train crew "ran towards danger" and confronted the knife-wielding attacker.

His actions stopped the attacker from advancing through the train, she added.

MPs also praised the quick reaction of train driver Andrew Johnson, a former Royal Navy officer.

Mr Johnson contacted the control room to get the train diverted from the fast track to the slow track when the alarm was raised.

It meant it could stop in Huntingdon, which allowed emergency services to quickly access the scene.

Mr Johnson said: "As train drivers, we hold a lot of responsibility. We practise our emergency response and keep up to date with our knowledge of the route, so if needed, we know exactly where to stop and what to do.

"The action I took is the same as any other driver. 

"I think my colleagues onboard were the real heroes and I'd like to pay tribute to their bravery."

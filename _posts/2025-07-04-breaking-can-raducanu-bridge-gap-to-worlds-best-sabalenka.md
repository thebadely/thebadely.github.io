Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Emma Raducanu is looking to beat a top-four player for the first time in her career when she faces Aryna Sabalenka in the Wimbledon third round

Let's not get carried away just yet.

On Wednesday, Emma Raducanu produced one of her best performances "in a long time" to beat 2023 champion Marketa Vondrousova and move into the Wimbledon third round.

But backing up that victory to reach the last 16 will probably require an even better display from the British number one on Friday.

Standing in her way is Aryna Sabalenka, the world number one and overwhelming favourite for the women's singles title.

Raducanu has made sound progress to climb back into the world's top 40 this season, but the evidence has shown there is still a clear gulf between the 22-year-old and the leading stars.

Both of her Grand Slam appearances this season were ended in ruthless fashion by five-time major champion Iga Swiatek - Raducanu winning only one game at the Australian Open and three at the French Open in a pair of demoralising defeats.

Coco Gauff, who went on to win the Roland Garros title, also proved too much of a step up in class for Raducanu on the Rome clay.

The challenge for Raducanu is discovering how she can test the very best.

"I think I need more weapons. I think I need to be able to hit the ball with better quality more often," Raducanu, the 2021 US Open champion, told BBC Sport before facing Sabalenka.

"I think I need to serve better. I think I need to hit better on the move. There are a lot of things I need to do better.

"Beating a top player like Marketa, who has won this tournament, was obviously a really positive thing for me and a really good marker.

"But I need to bridge the gap to the very, very top."

With her powerful serve and lights-out baseline game, Sabalenka has become the dominant player on the WTA Tour over the past 18 months.

The blistering nature of her shots translates to any surface and is why she has reached at least the quarter-finals in each of the past 10 Grand Slams she has played.

At Wimbledon, where Sabalenka has reached the semi-finals on her most recent two appearances, the faster courts suit her first-strike tennis.

This means she uses her serve and return of serve to quickly get on top of her opponents in the points.

Wimbledon's statistical insight tool calculates 39% of Sabalenka's shots are attacking, compared to an average of 24% in the women's draw.

"The last few years she's just been so consistent and solid," said Raducanu, who made the fourth round at the All England Club in 2021 and 2024.

"I just have to try to control my side as best as possible and, I guess, be smart.

"But, at the same time, I need to take my chances if I have any because I can't play passive against her.

"She can take the racquet out of your hand and just dominate if you give her that chance."

After being outclassed by Swiatek and Gauff on hard and clay courts, Raducanu feels the Wimbledon grass represents her best chance of pushing Sabalenka.

Since teaming up with coach Mark Petchey earlier this year, Raducanu has also looked to use her serve and forehand more aggressively.

The statistical analysis also shows she is more attacking than average in the women's draw - with 27% of her shots classed that way by TennisViz.

But she knows she cannot be "overly aggressive" and needs to use craft too.

Raducanu's return also needs to be on point against one of the best servers in the game.

The sliced backhand will be an important tool to take the pace out of Sabalenka's groundstrokes.

Her athleticism can also help Raducanu be more of a counter-puncher against the Belarusian and potentially draw mistakes.

"Raducanu's defence against Vondrousova was outstanding, albeit Vondrousova doesn't attack as much or with the same firepower as Sabalenka," said TennisViz's Phil Newbury.

"The slice could be key here. Sabalenka's 'steal score' - which calculates how often a player has won the point when they are defending during it -  was just below the draw average in her second round.

"It suggests if Raducanu can force her way into Sabalenka's defence, there could be positive rewards for her."

Raducanu feels she has a better chance of beating one of the leading players at Wimbledon than at the other majors.

As well as being comfortable on the grass, feeling "at home" is helping her play with more freedom.

Having a tight-knit and trusted group around her is a key factor in the progress she has made this season.

Petchey is a trusted ally who used to coach her as a teenager, while long-time confidante Jane O'Donoghue continues to provide support while on a career break from her finance job.

Raducanu has also been able to hang out with friends at Wimbledon and was seen taking selfies with them on the All England Club balcony after beating Vondrousova.

"I had the same sort of routine last year. I just really cherish these moments because we know how hard it is week to week playing on the tour," she said.

"When we're here in this sort of environment feeling at home, it's so special."

According to new developments, It's that time of year when winter viruses take hold, and a cacophony of coughs fill households, offices and public transport.

Often people turn to cough medicine for a fix. But does this work, or are homemade remedies like honey and lemon just as good?

Jacky Smith, a professor in respiratory medicine at the University of Manchester,  spoke to Radio 4's Sliced Bread to unblock fact from fiction.

Most coughs come from colds, and cold viruses usually need to work their way through you naturally. Cough medicines can't treat the underlying virus but they can soothe your throat and reduce the tickly sensations that make you cough.

If it's a dry cough then choosing balsams or sickly-sweet syrup-based soothing agents like glycerol, can help "coat your throat" and protect against the dryness, says Prof Smith.

But paying more for these isn't worth it with cheaper supermarket-own brands just as effective as the big names, she says.

The one thing to look out for on the label though is sugar content which as you'd expect with sweet syrups is often very high. Sugar-free cough medicines could be a better option if that's a concern.

Cough medicines often also advertise that they contain certain "active ingredients". These can include dextromethorphan, which claims to suppress your cough reflex - although Prof Smith says the impact is minimal.

Dosing is always important she adds, but especially with dextromethorphan which can be addictive. "You certainly wouldn't want to exceed the doses advised on the label," she says.

Levomenthol - an ingredient found in some cough syrups for chesty coughs - meanwhile, offers a "cooling sensation" at the back of the throat, which limits the tickle by masking the sense of irritation.

If it's a chesty cough then many find themselves battling what can feel like oceans of phlegm and a tight chest.

This can come from secondary infections like bronchitis, which inflame the airways, or the extra build-up of phlegm in your nose and sinuses.

It's natural to turn to an over-the-counter syrup, but Prof Smith's advice is to remain sceptical of their impact.

The ingredient guaifenesin, for instance, is claimed to loosen phlegm, but this lacks conclusive proof.

And while sedating antihistamines like diphenhydramine might help you sleep at night, they don't treat the cough itself.

There's similarly little evidence that plant extracts, like thyme and squill, have any impact.

Instead, Prof Smith says the best approach is for people to "wait it out", drink water to stay hydrated and take lozenges that encourage swallowing and "inhibit a cough" for a period of time.

A warm homemade mixture of honey and lemon can have just the same soothing effect for dry coughs as many over-the-counter options.

A Cochrane review  – an independent review of evidence - suggested that for children over one year with coughs and colds, the use of honey and lemon could "be of some benefit," adds Prof Smith.

It's also worth remembering that coughing is necessary. It's how our body gets rid of the mucus.

If it's a mucus-y cough, spitting out the excess can ease the airways.

"I will cough up whatever I need to," says Prof Smith. "I won't try and suppress it, get it out." If you do, make sure you use a tissue. 

But should you swallow, no harm is done and the stomach can still break it down.

You should only worry about the colour of what you're coughing up if it's dark brown as "there may be some blood in it".

Most chesty coughs generally settle after a few weeks without needing antibiotics, but if it lingers beyond three weeks, Prof Smith urges people to go to their GP.

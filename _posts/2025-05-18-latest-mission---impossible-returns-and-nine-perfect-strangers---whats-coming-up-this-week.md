Let's dive into the details: Tom Cruise is back in action this week, with Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning hitting cinemas.

But that's not all the week has in store.

Sex Education's Connor Swindells stars in new BBC drama series The Bombing of Pan Am 103, Nicole Kidman returns for season 2 of Nine Perfect Strangers, and Peter Andre's controversial film Jafaican is coming out.

Read on for what's coming up this week...

The highly anticipated eighth film in the long-running Tom Cruise-led spy action series is almost here.

Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning hits cinemas on Wednesday, and sees Ethan Hunt - played by Cruise - racing against time to find a rogue artificial intelligence, known as the Entity, that can destroy mankind.

Many reviews have been positive. Writing in the Independent, Clarisse Loughrey awarded it four stars, saying she "adored it".

Peter Bradshaw awarded it five stars in the Guardian, labelling it "wildly entertaining".

But Hollywood Reporter's chief film critic David Rooney was more critical, calling it "a disappointing farewell with a handful of high points courtesy of the indefatigable lead actor".

As ever, there's loads of focus on the stunts, with the film's social media account and trailer promoting plenty of impressive sequences, including 62-year-old Cruise hanging precariously off a helicopter.

"Your jaw will detach and your palms will leak sweat," writes John Nugent in Empire.

The BBC's new six-part drama, The Bombing of Pan Am 103, is about the UK's most deadly terror atrocity, when a bomb in the hold of a flight from London to New York exploded above the Scottish town of Lockerbie, killing 270 people in 1988.

A drama exploring what happened in the aftermath, a co-production with Netflix, reveals the painstaking police operation to find out who was behind the bombing. But it also explores the impact on victims' families, and the huge kindness they were shown by the town's volunteers.

Its cast includes Sex Education star Connor Swindells, Peter Mullan, Phyllis Logan, Patrick J Adams, Merrit Wever and Lauren Lyle.

Kara Weipz, whose brother Richard died in the crash, told me that "lessons were learned" in how victims' families were treated, after she and her family found out her brother Richard was among the dead via a news report. They should, of course, have been told in person.

She hopes the drama will generate some positivity after so much pain and anguish.

It's on BBC iPlayer and BBC One from 9pm this Sunday, and will be on Netflix globally at a later date.

There has been a fair bit of controversy over Peter Andre's new film, Jafaican, which hits cinemas on Tuesday.

The trailer saw the Mysterious Girl singer donning long dreadlocks and speaking in a Jamaican accent, which led to criticism from some viewers.

Andre did not respond to a request for comment from BBC News.

But speaking to Australia's Channel 7, he addressed the backlash, saying: "I think it's good to get all sorts of feedback."

"For me, it's acting - I get to do something light-hearted, something funny. Something that is the kind of film I'd want to watch."

The film tells the tale of a small-time crook, Gazza, who hatches a scam in a bid to secure £35,000 for his grandmother's care.

With just 21 days to pull it off, he must immerse himself in Jamaican culture to con his way between London and Jamaica.

Nicole Kidman is having quite the year.

She's already been in Babygirl, a film that sparked hundreds of memes, and starred alongside Succession's Matthew Macfadyen in Holland.

Now, she's back for season 2 of Nine Perfect Strangers, which drops on Prime Video on Thursday.

The show sees nine new strangers, connected in ways they could never imagine, invited by celebrity wellness guru Masha Dmitrichenko (played by Kidman) to join a wellness retreat in the Austrian Alps.

Over the course of a week, she takes them to the brink.

The first season got mixed reviews, with some critics noting it suffered from  comparison with The White Lotus.

But others praised the performances, with this season's cast also including Henry Golding (Crazy Rich Asians), Lena Olin (Alias) and Annie Murphy (Schitt's Creek).

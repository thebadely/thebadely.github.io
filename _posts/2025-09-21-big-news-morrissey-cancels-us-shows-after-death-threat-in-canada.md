Let's dive into the details: British artist Morrissey has cancelled two shows in the US after receiving a death threat ahead of a concert in Ottawa, Canada.

A 26-year-old Ottawa man was released on bail after allegedly uttering a threat to kill the singer, whose real name is Steven Morrissey, ahead of his performance at a music festival last week. 

The event went on as planned, but the singer later cancelled two shows in Massachusetts and Connecticut.

Morrissey was the front man of the rock band The Smiths, but left the band in 1987 to pursue a solo career.

He is known for being outspoken on issues such as animal welfare and politics. 

In 2006, he refused to tour in Canada in protest at the annual seal hunt.

After the threat against his life in Ottawa last week, he cancelled Friday's show in Connecticut and one in Boston.

"In recent days, there has been a credible threat on Morrissey's life," said a statement from the Boston venue on Instagram.

"Out of an abundance of caution for the safety of both the artist and the band, tomorrow's engagement at the MGM Music Hall at Fenway has been canceled."

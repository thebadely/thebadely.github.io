It has been recently reported that Cristian Romero has already missed two Premier League matches this season through suspension

Tottenham captain Cristian Romero has been given an additional one-match suspension and fined Â£50,000 for his behaviour during his side's defeat by Liverpool last month.

Romero admitted to a Football Association charge of "acting improperly by failing to leave the field of play promptly" after he was sent off in the 93rd minute of Tottenham's 2-1 loss on 20 December.

The Argentine defender was shown a second yellow card for kicking out at Liverpool's Ibrahima Konate after being fouled. His first booking came in the 66th minute for dissent.

Romero was also alleged to have behaved in a "confrontational and/or aggressive manner towards the referee".

Following a hearing, an independent regulatory commission has now imposed a one-match suspension and a Â£50,000 fine.

Romero has already served the automatic one-game suspension that was triggered by his dismissal, missing Spurs' 1-0 win against Crystal Palace on 28 December.

He was suspended for his side's 2-1 defeat by Fulham on 29 November because of yellow card accumulation.

An FA spokesperson said the written reasons for the latest sanctions will be published in due course.

It has been recently reported that Cristhian Mosquera had to be replaced just before half-time against Brentford after making his fourth Premier League start for Arsenal

Arsenal fear Cristhian Mosquera will miss at least six weeks to add to their defensive problems.

The Spanish defender is set for further tests to establish the full extent of the ankle injury suffered in the 2-0 midweek win over Brentford.

Mosquera's absence will be another blow to the Gunners, who also currently have first-choice centre-back pairing Gabriel Magalhaes and William Saliba sidelined.

The 21-year-old required treatment after landing awkwardly before being substituted, and early concerns are he will miss between six and eight weeks.

Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said his summer signing from Valencia required further examination as he added: "Mosquera is the one that is more complicated. We have another test today."

He also told Friday's news conference Saliba is "days" away from returning after a knock in training ruled him out of recent games against Chelsea and Brentford, while Gabriel may not be back until January with a thigh injury.

Mosquera and Piero Hincapie have been deputising for the pair but, with Mosquera now facing a long lay-off, Saliba's availability will be crucial for Arsenal, who are currently top of both the Premier League and Champions League group phase.

The Gunners visit third-placed Aston Villa on Saturday (12:30 GMT), before a trip to Club Brugge on Wednesday, 10 December (20:00 GMT).

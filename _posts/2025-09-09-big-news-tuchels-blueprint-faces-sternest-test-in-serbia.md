Let's dive into the details: England head coach Thomas Tuchel says his side will face quality and high emotion against Serbia in Belgrade

Thomas Tuchel's England World Cup blueprint faces the acid test against Serbia in the hothouse atmosphere of Belgrade's Rajko Mitic Stadium.

England coach Tuchel only has seven more games before he names his squad for next summer's World Cup, but the vital signs of serious progress have yet to be detected.

The dull 2-0 victory England ground out against Andorra made it four wins from four in qualifying. England will take a stride towards the showpiece if they can add another three points against Serbia.

England's results have been flawless, they are yet to concede a goal - but performances have been drab, devoid of inspiration and lacking a clear identity under Tuchel since he succeeded Sir Gareth Southgate after Euro 2024.

Tuchel's side have disposed of Andorra, twice, Albania and Latvia in a routine manner, but on Tuesday night England will enter hostile territory in Belgrade for a test of temperament they have yet to face under the German.

Serbia have been hit with a partial stadium closure reducing the near 52,000-capacity by 15% after supporters were guilty of bad behaviour, including "discrimination and racist abuse" against Andorra in June.

The environment is still expected to be boiling inside this atmospheric stadium - home to Red Star Belgrade - with conditions also likely to be extremely warm against Dragan Stojkovic's talented side, who had a 1-0 win in Latvia on Saturday.

Even the tunnel has assumed legendary status - a two-minute, 240 metre walk from dressing rooms to the pitch. The tunnel is largely unchanged from when it was built in 1963, emerging from behind the goal where Red Star's 'ultras' congregate for club games.

It is a nod to Red Star's illustrious history, when the stadium's capacity was 90,000 before seating reduced it to its current figure (51,755).

The ceiling is low and claustrophobic, the tunnel decorated with graffiti - all designed to act as inspiration for this highly-motivated Serbia team. If Dan Burn is selected, the 6ft 7in Newcastle United defender is unlikely be able to stretch to his full height walking out.

England captain Harry Kane knows what is awaiting the team, saying in Belgrade on Monday: "It's going to be tough. It will be a difficult evening but we have had these games before and we've handled them well.

"It will be even more hostile and they will try to make it as difficult as they can for us."

And there is no doubt Serbia will offer a threat to England.

Juventus forward Dusan Vlahovic will be a danger man, along with former Real Madrid forward Luka Jovic, now at AEK Athens.

Kane and company will be confronted by the formidable figure of Nottingham Forest central defender Nikola Milenkovic, but the spotlight will be on Tuchel and the search for indicators of progress in what has been, so far, a low-key and colourless transition from the Southgate era.

England are currently five points ahead of Serbia at the head of qualifying group K, having played a game more. Victory would surely put them in an impregnable qualifying position, but there was a steely confidence about coach Stojkovic when he addressed the media, along with Milenkovic, here on Monday.

Tuchel was predictably upbeat about the win against Andorra, even though thousands of fans inside Villa Park voted with their feet, leaving well before the end.

He described this meeting with Serbia as "proof of concept" - and it will certainly be a more accurate measure of the direction England are taking under Tuchel than knocking aside stubborn minnows such as Andorra, ranked 174th in the world.

And Tuchel has no doubts, despite the evidence of laboured performances, that he is on the right track, saying: "I see what I see. I feel what I feel. I am convinced we will get better and better."

He added: "We prepare for everything, we are in a very emotional sporting country - they have world class sportsmen, amazing talents in football and will have quality. We will face individual quality and a lot of emotion.

"It is our first away game together in a traditional stadium. I think the occasion will bring out the best in us."

Tuchel's job is simple. Win the World Cup, hence the 18-month contract and the belief he will then move on, irrespective of the outcome in Canada, Mexico and the United States.

And Tuchel has certainly upped the ante in public, suggesting this latest camp is a new phase of his World Cup planning, saying: "It was always in my head, on a white piece of paper, to use the first two camps to learn a lot and then use camps three, four and five for more competition and narrow it down."

Tuchel has been using Kane as his striker, but whether he adopts a different system from the 4-4-1-1 shape remains to be seen, having utilised three central defenders in his coaching career.

With the clock ticking down, international camps at a premium and every moment with his players vital, the visit to Serbia is not only the toughest qualifier England will face - it is the ideal opportunity for Tuchel to put a personal stamp on the side, with so far little sign of an upgrade on what Southgate was delivering when he reached successive Euros finals.

Tuchel's England have yet to fully reveal themselves with good performances; expected victories but pallid displays have even hinted at regression as opposed to progression.

Serbia, on their own territory, will present the sort of challenge that will be informative for both Tuchel and those seeking indications.

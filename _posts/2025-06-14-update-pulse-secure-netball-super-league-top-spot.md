It has been recently reported that Olivia Tchine helped Pulse finish the regular season with a 12th win in 14 games

London Pulse secured top spot at the end of the Netball Super League regular season - and with it home advantage for the major semi-final in the play-offs.

Pulse led Loughborough Lightning by two points going into the final round of games and were given a helping hand.

It came from Birmingham Panthers who caused a surprise in their coach Jo Trip's final game in charge by achieving a 67-58 success over Lightning, who have won three of the past four Grand Finals, to ensure Pulse finished top.

Antonia Mitchell had 42 goals for Panthers who pulled clear in the second quarter against a Lightning side who lacked fluency and will have plenty to think about before the play-offs.

Pulse then ensured they go into next weekend's game against Lightning on a high with a comfortable 67-44 victory over bottom side Cardiff Dragons, helped by 36 goals from Olivia Tchine.

The winner of the major semi-final goes straight to the Grand Final while the loser will face the winner of the minor semi-final between third and fourth - Manchester Thunder and London Mavericks - to determine the other finalist.

Thunder and Mavericks lined up for a dress rehearsal on Saturday with the Manchester side winning 67-45 at Wembley Arena, led by 50 goals from Elmere van der Berg.

In the weekend's final game on Sunday, the sport will say farewell to one of its greatest players.

Former England star Geva Mentor takes to the court for the last time before she retires as she lines up for Leeds Rhinos against Nottingham Forest (16:00 BST) in a match you can watch live on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website.

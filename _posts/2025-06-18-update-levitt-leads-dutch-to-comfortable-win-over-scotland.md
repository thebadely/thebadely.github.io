Scorecard

Scotland suffered back-to-back defeats in their T20 Tri-Series as they lost out to the Netherlands by 17 runs in Glasgow.

Dutch opener Michael Levitt was the standout performer, striking 90 off 57 deliveries in an imposing total of 198-7.

Decent showings from Max O'Dowd (21) and captain Scott Edwards (31) helped boost the visitors' score, despite some solid fielding from the Scots - including a fine boundary catch from George Munsey to dismiss Vikramjit Singh.

In reply, the Scots started slowly before makeshift opener Mark Watt ran himself out in the third over.

Munsey fell to a controversial catch at backward square-leg - with the ball appearing to bounce before it reached fielder Aryan Dutt - and when captain Richie Berrington was dismissed for just two, the Dutch were well on top.

Brandon McMullen was holding Scotland's chase together, but when he also fell to the part-time spin of Teja Nidamanuru for 51, they still needed more than 100 runs for victory.

Michael Leask struck five mighty sixes to revive Scottish hopes on a surface better suited for quick scoring than Tuesday's low-scoring loss to Nepal.

He was caught at long-on by Max O'Dowd off the bowling of Roelof van der Merwe to the delight of the men in orange.

With 27 needed off the final over, Dutt restricted the Scots to just 10, securing a comfortable victory.

Berrington's side face Nepal on Friday before travelling to the Netherlands for next month's T20 World Cup Europe Qualifier. 

"We felt after the first innings we were in the game with the one short side," Berrington said. 

"On the whole, our execution was good at times, but not for long enough throughout the game.

"When Michael Leask is in the middle, you're always in with a chance, but one of us couldn't hang in there long enough.

"We've been playing some good cricket and this week is great preparation for the qualifier. That's where we want to be peaking."

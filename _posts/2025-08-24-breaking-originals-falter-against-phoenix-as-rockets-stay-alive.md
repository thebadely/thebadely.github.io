Scorecard. Table

Manchester Originals' hopes of qualifying for the knockout stages of the women's Hundred suffered a blow after they lost to already-eliminated Birmingham Phoenix by 16 runs at Old Trafford.

In what should have been a routine chase of 112, the Originals collapsed in a heap with the bat, losing four powerplay wickets before being bowled out for 95. 

They had earlier reduced Birmingham Phoenix to 17-3 but were left to rue missing opportunities to dismiss Ellyse Perry and Sterre Kalis, who shared an unbeaten 94-run fourth-wicket partnership to drag their side to what would prove to be a match-winning total.

The Originals, who have never previously progressed beyond the group stage in the women's competition, headed into the match knowing that victory in their final two matches would guarantee a top-three finish.

However, this defeat means the Originals have slipped down to fourth place, behind London Spirit on net run-rate and trailing second-placed Northern Superchargers, who they face at Headingley on Tuesday, by four points.

After electing to bat in Manchester, Phoenix lost three wickets inside 30 balls, with Georgia Voll, Emma Lamb and Amy Jones all departing for single-figure knocks and Mahika Gaur taking 1-5 from her 15 powerplay deliveries, before Perry and Kalis combined to rebuild their side's innings.

Perry, scoring her second half-century in as many matches, posted 55 off 48 balls, although she should have been stumped on eight. Kalis, meanwhile, capitalised on being dropped on 13 by Beth Mooney to score 43 (39).

In reply, the Originals endured a nightmare start to their chase, with Kathryn Bryce needlessly run out off the third delivery of the innings. Megan Schutt (3-14) then had compatriot Mooney caught for a four-ball duck before Alice Monaghan and Melie Kerr departed in similar fashion to leave the batting side 14-4.

When big-hitting Deandra Dottin was caught on the boundary by Ailsa Lister for 13, the Originals' slim hopes of victory went with her. 

Three further run-outs and two wickets in two balls from Schutt compounded a dismal day for the hosts.

Rockets' King and Gardner dominate in 23-run victory against Fire

The Hundred women's competition, Sophia Gardens

Trent Rockets 145-6 (100 balls): Sciver-Brunt 38 (26); Davies 3-26

Welsh Fire 122-9 (100 balls): Dunkley 26 (23); King 3-17

Trent Rockets won by 23 runs

Scorecard. Table

Trent Rockets comfortably beat Welsh Fire by 23 runs to keep their faint qualification hopes alive in The Hundred women's competition at Sophia Gardens.

Coupled with Manchester Originals' defeat, Rockets now sit just four points outside the top three ahead of their final group outing against the Phoenix on Wednesday. 

Rockets successfully defended a competitive 145-6, with Fire, who were already knocked out, struggling for partnerships in their 122-9 reply. 

They were bamboozled by Rockets' world-class spinners, Australians Alana King and Ash Gardner, who took five wickets between them.

Leg-spinner King extracted plenty of turn and grip from the Cardiff surface with 3-17, while Gardner's relentless accuracy saw her take the key wickets of Sophia Dunkley for 26 and Hayley Matthews for 18.

Gardner also set up Rockets' competitive total in a partnership of 67 with England captain Nat Sciver-Brunt during the middle phase of the innings, after Bryony Smith's dynamic 38 from 27 balls at the top of the order gave them a useful platform.

Rockets were set for a formidable total at 120-2 with 20 balls remaining, but Fire dragged back some control as both set batters fell in the space of six balls, with Sciver-Brunt making 38 and Gardner 36.

Freya Davies took two wickets in two balls at the close as she finished with 3-26, but despite their strong fightback, it proved far too much for a batting line-up low in confidence after a miserable campaign.

Fire face unbeaten Southern Brave, who are already confirmed of a final spot, in their final game on Thursday.

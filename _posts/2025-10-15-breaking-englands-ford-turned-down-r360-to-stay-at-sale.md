It has been recently reported that George Ford won his 100th cap for England against Argentina earlier this year

George Ford says that he turned down an approach from big-money rugby union start-up R360 to extend his 102-cap England career.

The 32-year-old fly-half has signed a new three-year deal with Sale Sharks, where he has made 44 appearances and scored 341 points since joining in 2022.

England have previously confirmed that any players who join R360's global circuit, like any other stars based overseas, will be ineligible for Test selection.

"They contacted my agent to have discussions, but my decision-making around it was purely based on the fact I've got unbelievable desire to play for England," said Ford.

"I've loved my time at Sale Sharks as well and it never really got any further than that in terms of negotiations with the proposed new league.

"I love and I'm passionate about playing for England. I want to have the opportunity to I represent my country still. I feel I've still got a lot to give in a white shirt."

R360's aim of establishing eight all-star men's teams for a series of events in major cities was hit by a coordinated ban from leading unions last week.

England, New Zealand, Ireland and France were joined by Scotland, Australia, South Africa and Italy in saying they would not pick any R360 recruits for international matches.

Northampton fly-half Fin Smith, a reported R360 target, made a similar call to Ford last week, extending his terms at Franklin's Gardens, rather than pitch in with the proposed new competition.

Ford, who started all three Test matches on England's summer tour of Argentina and the United States while Fin Smith and Marcus Smith were on British and Irish Lions duty, also turned down "a couple of opportunities" overseas to stay in the Prem and available to England.

Sale boss Alex Sanderson estimated that, for star players like Ford, a move to R360 could earn them a third more than staying in England.

He added that moves to Japan could be a chance to double their money, while tax breaks for sportspeople add to the financial advantage of Top 14 clubs in France.

"It's fundamental for this club, pivotal for the club moving forwards, that we have him at the helm," said Sanderson.

"It's bigger than just how brilliant he is on the field.

"It is where he's from, where he wants to take the group and how well driven he is.

"He's a motivational force for me as a coach, not just the players that he plays with.

"It is a massive, massive show of intent from him for the direction the club's going."

Ford has kicked 30 points in three Prem games in 2025-26

Sale have reached the play-offs in each of four of their past five Prem campaigns, without being able to claim the title.

While Ford was restricted to only a 25-minute cameo off the bench in the Six Nations earlier this year, he has staked a strong claim to be first-choice stand-off when England begin their autumn campaign against Australia on 1 November.

Ford admitted the current depth and quality of fly-half options is unprecedented during his time with England, with former skipper Owen Farrell back at Saracens and in contention for a call-up again.

"It's brilliant, isn't it? It's where you want to be really in terms of squad depth. I'd imagine [head coach] Steve [Borthwick] is quite happy having four options like that," said Ford.

"Selection is so subjective. That's sort of a little bit out of my control right now, because my main focus at the minute is playing as well as I can for Sale.

"If I worry too much about if I'm going to get picked, I'm not going to get picked. It takes me away from my job in the here and now."

Sanderson however was emphatic in his backing for his man.

"There's only one George Ford," he said.

"You might win a game by 10 or 15 more points with a Marcus Smith. I think you'll definitely lose less games with George Ford because he almost makes it inevitable with what he does with the ball that the outcome is going to go your way."

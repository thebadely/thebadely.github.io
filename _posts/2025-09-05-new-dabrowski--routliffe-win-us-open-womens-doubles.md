It has been recently reported that Gabriela Dabrowski and Erin Routliffe knocked out the two pairs seeded first and second on their way to the US Open title

Gabriela Dabrowski and Erin Routliffe have won the US Open women's doubles title for a second time, beating top seeds Taylor Townsend and Katerina Siniakova in straight sets.

Canada's Dabrowski and New Zealand's Routliffe, who were previously champions at Flushing Meadows in 2023, were 6-4 6-4 victors on Arthur Ashe Stadium.

Dabrowski revealed in December that she had breast cancer surgery earlier in 2024 and gone through further treatment, while still continuing to challenge for the sport's biggest prizes.

After her diagnosis in April 2024, Dabrowski and doubles partner Routliffe lost the Wimbledon final to Townsend and Siniakova, before gaining revenge against the American/Czech pairing to win the end-of-season WTA Finals in November.

Dabrowski, 33, spoke before Friday's US Open final, external about the added perspective she had gained during the past 18 months.

Addressing 30-year-old Routliffe on court after the duo's first Grand Slam win since her diagnosis, Dabrowski said: "Erin, what a wild ride. It's been absolutely crazy.

"We've been through so much together and I feel extremely grateful to be standing here as a champion alongside you today. It means the world.

"Thank you for sticking by me, thank you for the support - and we rock on."

Meanwhile, defeat in the doubles brought an end to Townsend's eventful US Open.

The 29-year-old reached the last 16 of the women's singles, matching her best run at a Grand Slam, although her second-round win over Jelena Ostapenko was overshadowed by an argument between the pair at the end of the match.

Ostapenko later apologised for some of her comments.

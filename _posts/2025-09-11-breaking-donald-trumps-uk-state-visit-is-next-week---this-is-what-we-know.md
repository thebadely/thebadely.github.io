It has been recently reported that US President Donald Trump will soon make an unprecedented second state visit to the UK.

Trump, who will be accompanied by his wife Melania, was hosted by the late Queen Elizabeth II in June 2019.

A state visit is a formal trip to the UK by the head of a country. They are usually arranged at the invitation of the monarch, acting on government advice.

As well as being grand occasions with lots of pageantry, governments use the visits to further Britain's interests.

Traditionally, US presidents serving a second term - such as Trump - are not offered a state visit. Instead, they are invited for tea or lunch with the monarch, as happened with former presidents Barack Obama and George W Bush. 

However, in February Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer handed Trump an invitation from King Charles III during a White House meeting to discuss a UK-US trade deal. Sir Keir said the invite was "truly historic" and "unprecedented".

Trump said it was a "great, great honour".

Donald and Melania Trump will arrive in the UK on Tuesday 16 September and leave on Thursday 18 September.

King Charles will host the president and first lady at Windsor Castle on the Wednesday and Thursday.

The trip comes two months after the president spent four days in Scotland, where he met politicians and visited his golf courses. 

On arrival to the UK, the Trumps will be met by the US Ambassador Warren Stephens. The Viscount Hood, Lord-in-Waiting, will welcome them on behalf of The King.

On Wednesday, they will travel to Windsor Castle where they will be greeted by the Prince and Princess of Wales, before being formally welcomed by the King and Queen. A royal salute will be fired in Windsor and at the Tower of London.

Following lunch, the president will visit St George's Chapel in Windsor to lay a wreath on the tomb of Queen Elizabeth II.

Later, there will be a flypast by UK and US F-35 military jets and the Red Arrows.

On Wednesday evening, a traditional state banquet will be held at the castle, during which both the King and president will deliver speeches.

On Thursday, the president will travel to Chequers to meet the prime minister. 

They will view the Sir Winston Churchill archives before holding a meeting and a news conference. 

Melania Trump will remain at Windsor Castle where she will tour the Royal Library and see Queen Mary's Dolls' House, a famous miniature palace built in the 1920s. 

Mrs Trump will then meet Chief Scout Dwayne Fields with Catherine, who is joint president of the Scout Association.

She will then join her husband at Chequers before they return to the US. 

Final details about the equipment and personnel accompanying President Trump's second state visit have yet to be confirmed.

Trump arrived in the UK for his 2019 state visit on the customised Boeing 747-200B aeroplane known as Air Force One. 

The presidential motorcade - including two identical limousines nicknamed The Beast and other security and communications vehicles - was flown in on US Air Force transport aircraft. 

During the 2019 visit more than 6,300 police officers were deployed at a cost to London's Metropolitan Police of Â£3.4m.

The Stop Trump coalition is planning a "Trump Not Welcome" demonstration in London on Wednesday 17 September. 

It has called on the government to cancel the visit, accusing the US President of "denying climate science" and "siding with war criminals - in Israel, Russia and beyond".

The group organised protests in Aberdeen and Edinburgh during Trump's recent visit. Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in the two cities.

Trump was also booed by protesters who gathered along the perimeter of his Turnberry golf course in South Ayrshire, and a paraglider flew over the resort hotel with a banner criticising his presidency.

Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said he would boycott the ceremonial banquet for Trump to "send a message" over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

Since King Charles succeeded Queen Elizabeth in September 2022, he has hosted state visits from a number of international leaders and royals:

He and Queen Camilla have carried out state visits to France, Italy, Germany, Kenya and Samoa.

According to new developments, A community shop which runs a free second-hand school uniform scheme says it is "flat out" serving families who cannot afford to buy branded clothing.

Second Chance CIC in Hendon, Sunderland, collects donations of pre-worn items which are offered to those in need for no charge.

It comes as the Department for Education (DfE) tries to change the law to limit the number of compulsory branded items required by schools to three, plus a branded tie for secondary students, in a bid to cut costs for families.

Wendy English, director of Second Chance, said on average 20 families used the service each day and, "on top of bills and food, people just can't afford clothing".

The government believes parents in England will save around £50 per child through its school uniform measures, which it hopes to introduce in September 2026.

However, school uniform manufacturers claim the plans could end up costing them more.

The Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill still has several parliamentary stages to go through before becoming law.

Second Chance, which opened in April 2023, restocks its uniform donations daily and customers are able to access items without needing a referral service.

"We can struggle to restock the shop," Mrs English said. 

"We run out of donations but I think it shows how many people need us."

She believes the new rules are a "good start" for what she says is a growing problem. 

"We are flat out with families who can't afford to buy branded uniforms, so they come here," she said.

Second Chance aims to move to a larger site this year in order to better deal with the demand. 

"Some schools, like St Anthony's, have branded PE kits which contain the pupils initials," Mrs English explained.

"I'm currently looking at ways we can remove them so they can be used again." 

Marie Lanaghan, headteacher at St Anthony's Girls Catholic Academy, said uniforms can create a sense of "unity and pride" within a school, but she recognised cost challenges. 

"We appreciate a balance needs to be struck," she said.

"We welcome the government's new bill, which provides clarity." 

The average cost of a full school uniform and PE kit for a child at secondary school is £442, and £343 for a primary school pupil according to DfE data.

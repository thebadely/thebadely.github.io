It has been recently reported that Erling Haaland and Rodri have both been in training with Manchester City this week

Manchester City striker Erling Haaland has returned to full training following an ankle injury.

The Norwegian, 24, suffered the injury in the 2-1 FA Cup quarter-final win over Bournemouth on 30 March.

Haaland has been working on an individual training programme during his recovery, but was back with the first-team group on Wednesday.

He has scored 39 goals for club and country this season and, although it is not known when he will return to action, boss Pep Guardiola is expected to address the situation when he faces the media on Thursday before Friday's Premier League game against Wolves.

Meanwhile, 28-year-old midfielder Rodri has also been training with the first team, having been out since September with a serious knee injury.

The 2024 Ballon d'Or winner has not featured since last year after suffering a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).

Spain international Rodri had been spotted working on an individual training programme at City's Etihad Campus at the end of February.

Sources say the Club World Cup in June is a realistic timeframe for his return to action, rather than the remaining four games of the Premier League campaign or the FA Cup final.

Guardiola said last week: "Every training session he [Rodri] does with us, he does well. Rodri wants [to play] but the doctor will have to say, 'Pep you have the green light to give him minutes'.

"I want to rely on the doctors in that case."

City are currently fourth in the Premier League and relinquished hold of the title after four successive triumphs to new champions Liverpool.

They host Wolves on Friday (kick-off 20:00 BST) and face Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final at Wembley on 17 May.

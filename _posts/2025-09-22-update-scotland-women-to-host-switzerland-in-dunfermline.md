Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Caroline Weir will return to her home city of Dunfermline with Scotland next month

Scotland will play a friendly against Switzerland in Ballon d'Or nominee Caroline Weir's home city of Dunfermline next month.

Melissa Andreatta's Scotland side will meet the Swiss at East End Park in the second of two friendlies in October - with the first opponent and venue yet to be announced.

The Scots, who finished bottom of Nations League Group A1 earlier this year, will play Euro 2025 hosts Switzerland on Tuesday, 28 October at 19:30 GMT.

It will provide a first chance for Real Madrid star Weir - who has 112 caps and is the first female Scot to be nominated for the Ballon d'Or - to represent her country in her home city.

The Scotland women's national team play most home games at Hampden Park but have also used Tannadice and Easter Road of late.

Andreatta's reign as head coach began with a narrow home defeat by Austria, which confirmed relegation back to League B, but her second game was an impressive draw away to the Netherlands.

The Scots will view the October and November friendly windows as preparation for next year's World Cup qualification campaign, which begins in February.

Scotland have failed to qualify for the past three major tournaments, most recently missing out on this summer's Euros following a play-off defeat by Finland last December.

Shortly after that loss, Pedro Martinez Losa left his job as head coach and Andreatta was appointed in April.

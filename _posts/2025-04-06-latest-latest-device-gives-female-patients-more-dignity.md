It has been recently reported that It is hoped a device adapted to allow immobile female hospital patients to go to the toilet more easily could be rolled out nationwide.

Great Western Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Swindon, has called its move to bring in the UniWee a "groundbreaking project" which has now got the support of the NHS supply chain.

Staff at the emergency department there started adapting the disposable male urinal bottle for women to use, lessening the need for catheters and making life more dignified and pain-free in hospital. 

The design has now been formalised and researched, with plans in place for it to be used more widely in the future.

Many women who are forced to sit or lie down for long periods in hospital struggle to urinate without pain and movement.

Emergency department and trauma and orthopaedic staff at the Great Western Hospital started using the adapted bottle, collaborating with staff from NHS Trusts across the South West.

Research was done into how effective they were, with results published in the British Medical Journal's Emergency Medicine Journal. Now the manufacturer of the male bottles, OmniPac, has developed formal prototypes and is preparing to increase production.

With the support of NHS supply chain, the aim is to then roll it out across the country.

Emergency doctor and chief investigator Dr Si√¢n Thomas said: "We are thrilled to take this project further. Our future studies will explore how the UniWee can reduce catheter use and improve bladder care for patients.

"By gathering evidence, we hope to ensure that more patients and clinical teams benefit from this simple yet transformative solution."

The next phase of research will also involve patient and public engagement to ensure the UniWee continues to meet the needs of those it serves.

It has been recently reported that Laura Sugar added a European title to her Olympic and World Championship crowns 

Great Britain's Para-canoe team added a further three medals on the final day of the European Championships to finish top of the medal table.

The team finished with nine medals in all - four golds, four silvers and one bronze - seven medals clear of any other country. 

Laura Sugar raced to victory in the KL3 200m event, finishing 1.747 seconds ahead of France's Nelia Barbosa.

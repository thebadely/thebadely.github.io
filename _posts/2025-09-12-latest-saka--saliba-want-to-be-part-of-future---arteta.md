According to new developments, Both Bukayo Saka and William Saliba's contracts expire in 2027

Mikel Arteta has said that Bukayo Saka and William Saliba "want to be a big part of Arsenal's future" as talks about new contracts for the pair continue. 

Saka and Saliba, both 24, are in the last two years of their contracts with their current deals expiring in 2027. 

Centre-back Saliba said in the summer while on the club's pre-season tour of Singapore and Hong Kong that he would "hopefully" sign a new deal with the Gunners. 

Arsenal have tried to secure the futures of their key players with Saliba's centre-back partner signing a deal until 2029 and Myles Lewis-Skelly and Ethan Nwaneri signing new long-term contracts. 

Saliba has been linked with Real Madrid in the past but has said the speculation is not something he thinks about and winger Saka has said he "wants to win wearing this [Arsenal's] badge".

Manager Arteta, speaking before Arsenal's match with Nottingham Forest on Saturday, says the work to secure the players' future hasn't slowed down despite a busy transfer window with sporting director Andrea Berta taking a lead on discussions. 

"That never stops," Arteta said. "The collaboration around the club with what Andrea is doing and the agent is very good.

"The good thing is the players want to remain here and they want to be a big part of the history in this club over the next few years. 

"Andrea will drive that and we will see where we go." 

Saka has been ruled out of tomorrow's match with a hamstring injury while Saliba, who has an ankle issue, took part in today's training session. 

The Gunners have spent around Â£300m this summer as they look to try to win a first trophy since 2020. 

This week is the first time Arteta will have the full complement of his players at the training ground since the transfer window shut and the arrival of Piero Hincapie on transfer deadline day, with Arteta saying the squad has "clarity" and he is "happy". 

Arsenal take on Forest at home on Saturday in what will be Ange Postecoglou's first game in charge of his new team. 

The former Tottenham Hotspur manager has yet to beat Arteta, losing his last three games against Arsenal but the Gunners boss is expecting a tough game. 

"I think with Ange you know, his biggest strength is the way he has been. He has put his fingerprints on the team," Arteta said. 

"He has a very clear way of playing, a very clear DNA. Extremely good to watch, learn a lot from him. It will be a very difficult game."

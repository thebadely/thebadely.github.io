Let's dive into the details: The incident happened during an apprentice handicap race at Windsor

Five jockeys have been banned for 10 days after they failed to pull up in a chaotic flat race at Windsor where a blindfolded loose horse crashed into a plastic running rail.

The five-furlong handicap for apprentice jockeys at 16:52 BST on Monday featured a field of seven, but the result was declared void following a false start.

Master Zack, trained by Martin Dunne, was blindfolded to go into the stalls but reared up just before the gates opened.

Jockey Ryan Kavanagh remained in the stalls but riderless Master Zack set off with his vision obscured by the blindfold.

The three-year-old then veered to the right and crashed into a running rail before being caught with no major injuries reported.

Jockeys Tommie Jakes, Jack Doughty, Jack Dace, Taryn Langley and Alec Voikhansky all completed the course on their respective mounts but according to chief stipendiary steward Richard Westropp, ignored requests to stop.

Westropp said: "Our footage is very clear, the recall man is stood in the middle of the track and blowing his whistle. I think all the procedures were followed correctly."

All five jockeys will have the opportunity to lodge an appeal.

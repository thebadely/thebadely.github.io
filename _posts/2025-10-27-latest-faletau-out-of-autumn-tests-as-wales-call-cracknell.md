Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Taulupe Faletau has been capped 109 times by Wales while Olly Cracknell has the chance to make his debut

Wales have lost veteran number eight Taulupe Faletau for their autumn series to a knee injury.

The 34-year-old British and Irish Lions forward has been replaced by uncapped Olly Cracknell, 31, of Leicester Tigers.

Faletau limped off just four minutes into Cardiff's United Rugby Championship victory over Edinburgh on Saturday.

Wales head coach Steve Tandy admitted it was "hugely disappointing" to lose the 109-cap back row, who turns 35 next month.

He said: "It's hugely disappointing to lose Toby to injury as he's a world-class player. 

"But Olly's been playing really well for Leicester and we're excited to add him to the squad."

Wales face Argentina on Sunday 9 November before going on to host Japan, New Zealand and South Africa in Cardiff.

Wales recall Rees-Zammit for autumn Tests

Former Ospreys player Cracknell, 31, has impressed for Tigers in recent seasons and has been selected ahead of Ross Moriarty of Ospreys.

Born in Leeds, he qualifies for Wales through his grandfather and was capped six times at under-20s level before being called into the senior squad by Warren Gatland for the 2017 Six Nations.

He made more than 100 appearances for Ospreys before joining London Irish in 2021

Aaron Wainwright, Morgan Morse and Taine Plumtree are contenders for the Wales number eight spot as well as captain Jac Morgan.

Morgan, usually a flanker, made his first appearance of the season off after struggling with a calf issue, coming off the bench as number eight for Ospreys as they drew at Dragons on Saturday.

"It was great to see him back. He fitted straight back in and was very prominent despite not playing since July," said Ospreys head coach Mark Jones.

"His energy was high, he worked hard in the game and you would never have known he'd been out so long."

It has been recently reported that Khiara Keating is part of the 23-player squad representing England at Euro 2025

A court case against England goalkeeper Khiara Keating has been dropped nearly a year after she pleaded not guilty to possessing canisters of nitrous oxide. 

The 20-year-old Manchester City goalkeeper was charged with possession of a Class C drug on 18 June last year after an investigation by Greater Manchester Police.

In July, Keating appeared at Manchester and Salford Magistrates Court alongside her mother Nicola Keating, 48, who also denied the same offence, and both were granted unconditional bail.

Greater Manchester Police has confirmed the case has been discontinued.

In a statement given exclusively to BBC Sport, Keating said: "I'm relieved the charges have been dropped. As I've always said, I did nothing wrong. 

"It's been a difficult time, but I've always known the truth. Now I'm just looking forward to focusing fully on the Euros and spending time with my family."

Nitrous oxide was made a Class C drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act in November 2023.

Possession with the intention of wrongfully inhaling it for a psychoactive effect became an offence, but it is still possible to use the gas for legitimate reasons, such as in catering or pain relief during labour.

Keating has not made an appearance for England's senior team yet but is part of the 23-player squad selected to compete at Euro 2025 next month.

She became the youngest player to win the Women's Super League Golden Glove award last year, after keeping nine clean sheets in 22 league games.

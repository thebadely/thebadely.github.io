'We have to feel the pain' - Martin on Rangers humiliation

"Embarrassed" Russell Martin described Rangers' "humiliating and painful" six-goal defeat at Club Brugge as "probably the toughest night" of his career - but he has no concerns about his future.

A demoralising evening in Belgium intensified the scrutiny the former Scotland defender is facing from the Ibrox support, who Martin issued an apology to following the record-equalling European loss.

The 6-0 defeat contributed to a 9-1 aggregate thumping, eliminating Rangers from the Champions League play-offs in the most ignominious fashion.

"To the fans, I have nothing but an apology," said Martin. "I'm very sorry they had to witness that. 

"It's humiliating and it's painful. There's disappointment and hurt that they've had to go through that.

"I don't think I've learnt anything new tonight, I'm just embarrassed by the defeat. It's probably the toughest night I've had as a head coach. 

"It doesn't change the fact I think we will progress, move forward and grow."

Here, BBC Scotland looks at how Martin's hardest night unfolded, and how he plans to recover from a troubling start.

Martin's team selection raised eyebrows again as captain James Tavernier and midfielder Nicolas Raskin both started on the bench.

Asked about the decision to drop Belgium midfielder Raskin pre-match, the Rangers boss said wanted to play the "freshest" and "most attacking" team available to him.

That plan was binned within eight minutes after Nicolo Tresoldi's early opener was followed by right-back Max Aarons' red card.

"Madness" was how Martin described Rangers' start in Bruges. "There's so much self-inflicted pain. Our response to disappointment is so poor."

Following the 3-1 first-leg defeat last week, Martin insisted his side would never again concede the manner of goals his team lost in a calamitous first half at Ibrox.

Eight days later, against the same opponent, his team were five down by the break. They were six down by minute 50.

"I don't think we'll be beat 6-0 again," was Martin's view after this one.

Former Rangers striker Billy Dodds was fearing the worst as Brugge's second hit the back of the net. "This could get really embarrassing," he said on BBC Sportsound.

Three goals and 15 minutes later, the ex-Ibrox coach added: "It's not a nice night to be here and witness this as a Scottish football fan - they're getting ripped apart."

By the full-time whistle, Dodds was "losing the will to find words".

Have your say on the action

It seems bonkers to suggest Rangers would have settled for six at the break, but given Brugge's final goal came with 40 minutes remaining, it is a realistic thought.

The relentless hosts ended the match with 32 shots, 26 of which were inside the Rangers 18-yard area.

They also had 70 touches in the opposition box. Martin's side had zero.

Sunday's first Old Firm derby of the season against Celtic offers Rangers the chance to put a torrid night behind them, but many fans will not want to see Martin in the dugout.

The former Southampton manager revealed he is dealing with a squad that has "disrupted harmony", but he remains convinced he can turn things around.

Although many supporters have lost patience at such an early stage, Martin says the Rangers hierarchy "understand this might take time".

The head coach is now aiming to use the "pain and humiliation" as "fuel" for the derby.

"The manner of defeat tonight is not acceptable and hurtful," Martin added. "But I have no other choice but to keep working and keep focused.

"The weight is heavy on the group and we need to take that off them and move forward. I need to take everything that is thrown at me and so do the players. 

"But it's my responsibility to accept all of it. It won't affect the work we do moving forward.

"I don't think we need to win on Sunday to secure my job, we need to win to make ourselves feel better and make the fans feel better, and to give them a performance they can be proud of."

Let's dive into the details: James Tavernier was dropped by Russell Martin after the draw at Fir Park

Russell Martin will not "overly stress" about his Rangers team being leaked before Tuesday's Champions League qualifying win over Viktoria Plzen.

Unhappy at last Saturday's 1-1 draw away to Motherwell, the Rangers head coach dropped four players, including captain James Tavernier and last season's star performer, midfielder Nicolas Raskin, for the first leg at Ibrox against the Czech side.

His team selection for what turned out to be a commanding 3-0 victory was widely known on social media hours before kick-off.

"I've said to the guys, it's not ideal," Martin said. "But I'm also not going to lose sleep over it."

Martin reckons "it has become more common in the modern game" that leaks happen.

"I was told when I turned up to the stadium because I'm not on any social media," he revealed.

"People are left out, they tell their agents, friends and family - then somehow it gets to the media quickly. I can't really control any of that.

"I don't think anyone would do it from inside this building to intentionally hurt us.

"I'm not sure it changes the opposition's plan eight hours before a game as they'll have done pretty much all of their work by then I presume."

Despite the leak, Martin still prefers to name his team "really early" before a match.

"It means people don't waste time or energy wondering if they're in the team and we can work on certain things," he added.

"There's enough stuff in this job to be concerned about and to focus on all the time, so I'm not going to overly stress about the team being leaked."

Martin will again be without new signings Mikey Moore and Thelo Aasgaard, plus fellow forward Hamza Igamane, for Saturday's Scottish Premiership visit by Dundee.

Moore is still waiting on international clearance as he is deemed a minor by world governing body Fifa, but the Tottenham Hotspur loanee will be available once he turns 18 on Monday.

Meanwhile, Aasgaard and Igamane are working their way back to full fitness.

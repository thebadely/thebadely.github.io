Let's dive into the details: A man living at a hotel that has been the focus of a series of anti-migrant protests has been charged with sexual assault.

Mohammed Sharwarq, 32, a Syrian national living at The Bell Hotel, Epping, Essex, also faced two counts of common assault and four of assault by beating - concerning four complainants - at a hearing before magistrates in Chelmsford on Wednesday.

Essex Police said the offences were alleged to have taken place between 25 July and 12 August. 

He was arrested on Tuesday and remanded in custody. Officers said they were not seeking any other suspects in relation to the case.

The BBC understands the alleged offences took place within the Bell Hotel.

The hotel has been used by the Home Office to house asylum seekers, and has been the scene of a number of protests in recent weeks.

Dr Neil Hudson, Conservative MP for Epping Forest, said: "I am deeply concerned by reports that a resident of the Bell Hotel has been charged with multiple assaults, including an offence of a sexual nature.

"I have contacted the Home Office urgently, requesting further information and calling for reassurances on management and safeguarding."

He said he had also been liaising with Essex Police and had written to the Home Secretary calling for the hotel to be "immediately closed for community safety".

In a statement the Home Office said it could not comment on ongoing legal proceedings.

But it said it was changing the law to "ensure individuals convicted of any registered sexual offence can have their asylum claim denied", adding "we will do everything in our power to pursue their deportation from the UK".

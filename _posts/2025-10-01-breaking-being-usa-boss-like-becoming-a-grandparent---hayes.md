It has been recently reported that Emma Hayes has managed the United States since May 2024

United States boss Emma Hayes says working in international football is like "becoming a grandparent" as managers only spend short periods of time with their players.

The former Chelsea manager, speaking after being inducted into the National Football Museum's Hall of Fame, said managing the US has been "thoroughly enjoyable".

"It has been incredible, it really has," said the 48-year-old. "It is like becoming a grandparent, international football. You don't get to see them [the players] all of the time and you send them back to their parents - or their clubs - at the end of that period.

"I've really enjoyed getting to know a new set of players and working with a nation that have been really dear to me and a massive part of my development."

Hayes added that she felt she had been "ready" for a move away from club football after a career that saw her win seven league titles with Chelsea, and said her new role allows her to "zoom out" and use her "strategic thinking" to focus on long-term solutions.

Just under three months after taking over as US manager, she led the side to a gold medal at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.

They also reached the final of the invitational SheBelieves Cup in February, although they were beaten 2-1 by Japan.

"I didn't think the transition would be what it is. It's been thoroughly enjoyable and I'm enjoying life as an international coach," she said.

"I always felt as a club coach you've just got to go every three days and it's just the next game. To have a little bit longer to think about a course to winning and how to put in place the best practices, I feel like having that time has freed me up to develop another part of myself."

Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme, Hayes told sport presenter Delyth Lloyd  she was "proud" of her inclusion in the hall of fame, which puts her alongside managers such as Sir Alex Ferguson, Arsene Wenger, Bob Paisley and Brian Clough.

She said: "I think it's a proud day for me and my family and one where I think, once you've taken time from the work I've done at Chelsea, I get the opportunity to reflect on that. I'm really happy to be here."

Hayes expressed pride, too, for how Chelsea have performed under new manager Sonia Bompastor, and she said her successor has taken the team "to a new level".

She also paid tribute to former Liverpool and Chelsea boss Matt Beard following his death earlier this month, saying he will be remembered as a "great human being".

"Players loved him. He cared about them, he developed them, he built a winning team at Liverpool," said Hayes. "He has influenced so much of the ecosystem [in women's football] and he did it before anybody else was looking, he did it when he didn't have any money.

"His sacrifice was so huge that his legacy will be so many things that it's important we continue to shine a light on the struggles that human beings can have and remember that Matt Beard and the community he created is unique in a lot of ways and one we have to protect in honour of his legacy."

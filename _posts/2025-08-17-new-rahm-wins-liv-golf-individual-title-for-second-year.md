Let's dive into the details: Jon Rahm is expected to be named as a captain's pick for Europe at the Ryder Cup in September

Full leaderboard

Jon Rahm has been crowned as the LIV Golf individual champion for the second consecutive year, despite losing in a play-off to Sebastian Munoz in Indiana.

The Spaniard shot an 11-under 60 to finish at 22 under  alongside Colombia's Munoz, who made headlines when he fired a 59 in Friday's first round.

Munoz made a birdie on the first extra hole on Sunday, while Rahm was only able to make a par. 

However, the result was good enough for Rahm to beat Chile's Joaquin Niemann - who finished in a tie for fourth on 17 under at the Club at Chatham Hills - to the season-long award, as he did in 2024, and top prize of $18m (Â£13.3m).

There was also good news for two of Rahm's former European Ryder Cup team-mates, Lee Westwood and Ian Poulter, who both avoided being relegated and dumped by LIV for 2026. 

Westwood birdied four of his first five holes to finish in a tie for 17th on 12 under along with fellow Englishman Poulter, who birdied four of his last five holes to push his Majesticks co-captain Henrik Stenson into the relegation zone.

Rahm's success has been founded on consistency. 

The 30-year-old failed to win a single event all year as Niemann took titles in Adelaide, Singapore, Mexico City, Virginia and Britain.

However, the Spanish superstar was inside the top 10 in all but one of his 13 appearances on the Saudi-backed Tour.  

And he was the standout player on Sunday as he charged up the leaderboard, with six birdies in his first 10 holes and an eagle on the par-five 13th. 

A bogey at the 14th proved little more than a slight setback as Rahm, who is expected to receive a captain's pick for September's Ryder Cup, knocked in four consecutive birdies to cap a superb round.

Niemann's Torque won the Indy team title, its first triumph since 2023, but Rahm's Legion XIII holds the top seeding for next week's LIV Team Championship in Michigan.

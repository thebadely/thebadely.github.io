Here’s what you need to know: Best-selling children's author and comedian David Walliams has denied allegations of inappropriate behaviour after being dropped by his publisher HarperCollins UK.

A spokesperson for HarperCollins said it had decided not to release any new titles by Walliams "after careful consideration, and under the leadership of its new CEO".

The Telegraph says it follows an investigation into allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards young women. HarperCollins did not confirm the reasons for its decision.

A spokesperson for Walliams said he had "never been informed of any allegations raised against him" by his publisher.

"He was not party to any investigation or given any opportunity to answer questions. David strongly denies that he has behaved inappropriately and is taking legal advice," the spokesperson added.

The publisher said it took employee wellbeing "extremely seriously" with "processes in place for reporting and investigating concerns". 

"To respect the privacy of individuals we do not comment on internal matters," the company said.

Walliams is one of the UK's most successful children's authors, having sold more than 60 million copies worldwide in 55 languages.

HarperCollins published his first children's book, The Boy in the Dress, in 2008. 

Some of his books, including Gangsta Granny and Billionaire Boy, have also been adapted into television films.

He has published more than 40 books in total, including a Christmas book titled Santa & Son, which was published by HarperCollins in October.

He first rose to fame on TV sketch series Little Britain and has also won National Television Awards for his work as a judge on Britain's Got Talent.

He was made an OBE in 2017 for his services to charity and the arts.

But he has faced controversies including being criticised after appearing to make two Nazi salutes during a recording of BBC comedy panel show Would I Lie To You? this summer.

In 2022, he apologised and admitted making "disrespectful comments" about two Britain's Got Talent contestants during a break in filming.

He left the programme that year and sued the production company over the leaking of the remarks, reaching a settlement with them in 2023. 

HarperCollins UK appointed Kate Elton as its new chief executive in October.

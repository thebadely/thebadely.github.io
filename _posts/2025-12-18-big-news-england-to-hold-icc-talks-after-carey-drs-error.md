Carey survives England review for caught behind appeal as Snicko shows phantom spike

England will hold discussions with cricket's governing body with the aim of improving decision-making technology following a controversial error on the opening day of the third Ashes Test.

Australia wicketkeeper Alex Carey survived a review for caught behind at the Adelaide Oval, only to later admit he edged the delivery bowled by England's Josh Tongue.

Carey was given not out because the Snicko technology showed a discrepancy between the sound and pictures of the edge.

BBG, the company that provides Snicko, has admitted responsibility for the error.

At the close of play on day one, England head coach Brendon McCullum and team manager Wayne Bentley met with match referee Jeff Crowe.

Crowe confirmed the matter would be reviewed and England had a review reinstated for Australia's first innings.

The England and Wales Cricket Board will also hold talks with the International Cricket Council (ICC) in an attempt to review and raise standards of the decision review system (DRS).

It is an ICC requirement for DRS to be in operation in all fixtures in the World Test Championship.

However, the ICC does not specify which technology providers should be used. In this instance, the Snicko system used in Australia is different from the Ultraedge employed for Tests in the UK.

Snicko operator error behind controversial Carey reprieve

Carey was on 72 at the time he was reprieved and went on to make a crucial 106.

Speaking at the close of the play, the left-hander said: "I thought there was a feather or some sort of noise when it passed the bat," said Carey.

"If I was given out I think I would have reviewed it, probably not confidently. It was a nice sound as it passed the bat."

The error in the review was explained as Snicko using the sound captured by the stump microphone at the non-striker's end, rather than the striker's end.

"Given that Alex Carey admitted he had hit the ball in question, the only conclusion that can be drawn from this, is that the Snicko operator at the time must have selected the incorrect stump mic for audio processing," BBG told BBC Sport.

"In light of this, BBG Sports takes full responsibility for the error."

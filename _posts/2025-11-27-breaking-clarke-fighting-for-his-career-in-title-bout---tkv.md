Frazer Clarke and Jeamie 'TKV' Tshikeva share a tense face-off

Heavyweight Jeamie 'TKV' Tshikeva said Frazer Clarke is "fighting for his career", while Clarke questioned TKV's previous injury as they bickered at a tense news conference.

They will contest the vacant British heavyweight title at Derby's Vaillant Arena on Saturday, to be shown live on BBC Two from 20:00 GMT.

The bout was originally set for 25 October but was postponed after TKV sustained a rib injury.

Clarke, 34, said the postponement allowed TKV to "buy more time".

TKV, 32, said defeat for 2020 Olympic bronze medallist Clarke could mark the beginning of the end of his professional career.

"I feel like I'm fighting to further my career, if anything. After this fight, there are big fights out there," Clarke replied.

'Big Fraze' drew with current WBO champion Fabio Wardley when they met for the British title in March 2024, before Wardley stopped him in the first round of their subsequent rematch - Clarke's only loss in 11 pro fights.

Clarke said victory on Saturday could set up a trilogy bout with Wardley and a shot at a world title.

"If that opportunity arises, oh my god, I'd take it with both hands," Clarke said.

The conference in Derby ended with an intense staredown involving four security guards.

Tensions rose again when TKV stepped in front of Clarke during the posed photographs, prompting Clarke to walk away.

Although TV and Clarke had clashed on social media in the past, both appeared to have moved on and have spoken about the "responsibility" of bringing boxing to free-to-air television. But TKV's withdrawal reignited old tensions.

Referring to a heated media interview earlier this week, TKV said: "He has a persona - he's a good guy in front of the cameras, but behind the scenes he makes cheeky comments."

TKV was particularly angered by allegedly being called a "thug".

"Never in your life label me a thug again. Never label me a wannabe gangster," he said.

"I'm a uni graduate, I'm a family man and I'm a professional boxer."

Clarke, from nearby Burton-upon-Trent, said: "Don't try to act like it then. Why can't I make cheeky comments - are you my dad?"

Londoner TVK responded: "Any young kids from inner cities, don't let anyone label you a thug."

A grinning Clarke then said: "Smartest thing you've ever said. Let's give him a round of applause."

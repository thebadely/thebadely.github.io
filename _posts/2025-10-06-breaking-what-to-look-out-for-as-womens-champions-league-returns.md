According to new developments, Arsenal won the Women's Champions League for the second time in May

The Women's Champions League is back this week - but not as you know it. 

This year marks the introduction of the inaugural league phase with all three English representatives handed tough fixtures. 

Defending champions Arsenal are joined by Women's Super League champions Chelsea, as well as Manchester United - who will be making their debut in the competition after coming through qualifying.

The English contingent will be joined by 15 other clubs from across Europe who will be looking to lift the trophy in May in Oslo, Norway.

From Chelsea's trip to Barcelona to the return of Paris St-Germain keeper Mary Earps to Manchester United, there is plenty to look forward to. 

BBC Sport takes a deeper look at the competition and what to expect this time around.

Arsenal to meet eight-time winners Lyon in Champions League

The Women's Champions League is following the lead of the men's tournament this year and moving from a group format to a league phase.

For those who have already followed the men's competition, it's a similar idea - but there are some changes.

There are half the number of teams, 18 rather than 36, which means there is no last 16 and teams play six matches rather than eight in the first phase.

Teams finishing first to fourth will automatically qualify for the quarter-finals, with the next eight teams - from fifth to 12th - facing off in two-legged play-offs to determine who will join them.

The sides from 13th to 18th will see their journey come to an end for the season. 

Arsenal are the only English side to have won the Women's Champions League

On paper... good!

Arsenal, of course, are the defending champions after stunning Barcelona in May to become two-time winners. 

The Gunners face a tough opener at home to Lyon, while they will also take on Real Madrid - two teams they beat on their run to the trophy last season. 

However, Renee Slegers' side have endured a tough start to the season and will will head into their Champions League opener on Tuesday on a three-game winless run.

For Chelsea, the Champions League has proved elusive so far. 

Sonia Bompastor's side conquered every domestic title last term and find themselves at the top of the WSL table five games into the campaign.

But they were thrashed 8-2 by Barcelona in the two-legged Champions League semi-finals last term and will meet the Spanish side again in perhaps the most eye-catching match of the league phase.

The Blues have added to an already winning squad by bringing in Champions League winner Ellie Carpenter and USA international Alyssa Thompson, while Sam Kerr has returned to fitness after 20 months out with an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury.

Above all others, this is the trophy Chelsea want. 

Manchester United come into this competition with different ambitions than Arsenal and Chelsea - but will still want to progress as deep as they can. 

They came through two rounds of qualifying to book their spot in the main draw for the first time.

Unbeaten in the WSL this season, United will host PSG - meaning a reunion with goalkeeper Earps - and former winners Lyon and Wolfsburg. 

Marc Skinner has already highlighted his desire to strengthen his squad in the winter, with United lacking the depth needed to compete on all fronts. 

But with the likes of Ella Toone and new addition Jess Park pulling the strings in the centre of the pitch, United could earn some positive results.

Alexia Putellas is a three-time Champions League winner

As ever where the Champions League is concerned, it is difficult to look beyond Barcelona. 

The Catalans have reached the past five finals - winning three of them - and boast three-time Ballon d'Or winner Aitana Bonmati in their talented squad.

Last year's runners-up are tearing up Liga F once again, winning their opening six games - conceding just once and scoring 30 goals.

French side Lyon have won this competition a record eight times - most recently in 2022 under Bompastor. Top of the French league, they are another side who will have eyes on a deep run.

They were bested by eventual winners Arsenal in the semi-finals and will be looking for revenge when the sides meet in the league phase. 

German champions Bayern Munich have made it to the semi-finals twice in their history but certainly have a squad capable of going further. 

Bayern beat Arsenal in the group stages last season but were knocked out at the quarter-final stage by Lyon. 

Talented midfielder Lena Oberdorf is back to fitness after an ACL injury and will join England's Georgia Stanway in the middle of the pitch. 

Their German rivals Wolfsburg - two-time Champions League winners - can never be ruled out and have matched Bayern for pace so far in the Frauen-Bundesliga this season, with the two sides level on points at the top of the table.

There is plenty to look forward to in this year's edition of the Women's Champions League. 

Making their debut alongside Manchester United are Belgian champions OH Leuven. They have been handed big-name ties against Arsenal, Barcelona and PSG.

When the league phase took place for the first time in the men's Champions League last season, the competition threw up plenty of surprises.  

Defending champions Real Madrid finished 11th, 2023 winners Manchester City made it through to the knockouts with just one point to spare, while eventual winners Paris St-Germain ended up 15th.

Meanwhile, teams like Aston Villa and Lille performed better than expected to qualify automatically for the last 16. 

So, could we see the same sort of surprises in the women's competition?

"When it comes to the Champions League and this new format of a league stage, I think it's going to be tough playing these games home and away," former England defender Steph Houghton told BBC Football Focus.

"To cope with Champions League football and also the WSL you need big squads to be able to rotate and be fresh on gameday."

BBC Sport has signed a five-year deal to broadcast live Women's Champions League matches from this season.

Up to seven live matches - including the final - will be available to watch each season across BBC TV, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.

The first game to be shown will be Manchester United's match with Paris St-Germain at Old Trafford on 12 November, followed by Chelsea's meeting with Spanish giants Barcelona on 20 November.

Other matches will include both legs of one semi-final and four matches from earlier in the competition. 

The best moments from other games will also be available across BBC Sport's digital platforms and social media, while BBC Radio 5 Live will continue to bring live commentary of the biggest games throughout the season.

Experts revealed that The Times calls the government's gagging order a "cover-up" and says the leak risked the lives of up to 100,000 Afghans.

It says ministers had originally earmarked £7bn for the relocation scheme.

The Daily Telegraph says it's spoken to a senior Taliban official, who said they had obtained the list of personnel shortly after the leak, and was hunting down those named on it, potentially rendering the secrecy battle pointless.

The Guardian features the story of a man who has gone into hiding since he was told of the data breach, saying he fears he will be tortured and killed.

The Daily Mail's front page features an image of an unmarked plane landing at Stansted Airport in 2024.

The paper says such aircrafts have been arriving at the airport - secretly carrying Afghan migrants - every few weeks.

The Financial Times says more than 600 Afghans have begun legal action to sue the Ministry of Defence over the data breach.

The BBC's sacking of the Masterchef host, John Torode, also features heavily on today's front pages.

"Chopped" is the Sun's headline - the paper says the chef learned about his departure from the show when he read about it on the BBC News website.

The Daily Mirror thinks the sacking of John Torode and Gregg Wallace casts doubt on whether new episodes that have already been filmed will ever be aired.

The Daily Express leads with the jail sentences - or "Gap Years" as the paper dubs them - handed down to the two men responsible for cutting down the Sycamore Gap tree.

It quotes the prosecution's description of the act, as having been carried out in a "deliberate, professional way".

The i Paper details Gloucester Cathedral's unusual idea to raise funds for repairs - by selling "blessed" beer. 

The paper features a photo of the Dean of Gloucester, who has teamed up with a local brewery to bless the appropriately named drink called "CathedrALE".

It's hoped it will raise money to fix cloisters featured in two Harry Potter films.

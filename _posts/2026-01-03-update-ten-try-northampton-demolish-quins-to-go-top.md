Alex Coles scored a hat-trick as Northampton Saints produced an irresistible 10-try performance to demolish Harlequins and return to the top of the Prem table. 

Saints breached the Quins' defence almost at will in the first half with Danilo Fischetti, Coles, Alex Mitchell and Tommy Freeman all getting their names on the scoresheet. 

Cassius Cleaves and Alex Dombrandt responded for Quins, but two further scores each from Coles and Edoardo Todaro in the second half, plus one from Fin Smith, secured another breathtaking Saints victory.

They will be concerned, however, about an injury suffered by captain Fraser Dingwall, who was carried off wearing a neck brace close to half-time.

After Bath went to the top of the table with a dramatic win over Exeter earlier in the day, Northampton fell behind within minutes of the start.

Benefitting from quick ball, the visitors drove into the Saints 22, before Marcus Smith eventually found Cleaves on a perfect line to split the home defence before dotting down.

Both sides then spurned chances, with George Turner inches away from a try on his first league start, before Saints levelled the scores.

A scintillating break down the wing involving George Hendy and James Ramm brought them to the Quins' line, which was then promptly breached by the rampaging Fischetti.

In sparkling form, full-back Hendy was also instrumental in the Saints' second try, running a beautiful loop to isolate defenders, before offloading to Ramm who eventually fed Coles for another superb attacking score.

Alex Mitchell was a key component in everything good Saints did in the first half, including scoring a try of his own

A third soon followed for Phil Dowson's men, with Quins unable to deal with the speed of the attack, and quick offloading from Fischetti and Coles freed scrum-half Mitchell, who had no difficulty in reaching the line.

Fischetti then inflicted further pain on Quins by scoring his second from Mitchell's offload to secure the bonus point well before the interval.

Harlequins responded with their second from a perfectly executed set-piece move from a line-out in the 22, the ball quickly recycled through Chandler Cunningham-South to Dombrandt, who dived over untouched in the corner.

It was to prove only a temporary respite as, with seemingly nothing on, Mitchell danced his way around multiple defenders in midfield before feeding Freeman, who evaded Nick David as Saints reached the interval 33-14 in front.

The game, unsurprisingly, did not continue at quite the same ferocious pace in the second half, but that did not prevent Saints from adding to their lead.

Craig Wright was just one of numerous players battering at the Quins line, before the ball found its way to Coles, who proved unstoppable from point-blank range.

Todaro then got in on the scoring, the Italy winger the beneficiary of further wizardry from Hendy to sprint away and dive over untouched.

Northampton's eighth try was more fortuitous than well-crafted, with Smith the happy recipient following a pass from Anthony Belleau that rebounded off the head of JJ van der Mescht.

Yet another spectacular score followed, however, when Todaro powered his way through four Quins tacklers to secure his brace before Dombrandt added his second as a consolation after a break from Rodrigo Isgro.

Saints were not done, with Coles getting his hat-trick with the final score of the game as they returned to the top, two points clear of Bath.

The result left Harlequins in eighth, one point above Gloucester in ninth.

Northampton head coach Sam Vesty told BBC Radio Northampton:

"We scored some fantastic tries there, got the game going really fast and we're dangerous when we're like that.

"Slightly disappointed in our defence in the first half. I thought we were much better in the second half in that respect.

"Alex Coles has been excellent. He's always on the end of a line break and he's the best celebrator in the team - he's always next to the guy scoring a try but it's often him on the end of it."

On Fraser Dingwall: "Fraser's up and about and smiling so all good in that respect. They [medics) are uber-careful and if it takes five or six minutes (to treat a player), it's the right thing to do."

Harlequins head coach Jason Gilmore:

"If you keep copping those defeats, it's not going to be sustainable. That's pretty obvious.

"It's not just going to turn around overnight and we've got to be a clear as a club over what we need to do to make sure we're winning big games more consistently.

"We are where we are at the moment, we understand that. There's no magic formula to it, we've just got to make sure we keep stepping forward and hopefully get some bodies back on the field because the injuries are magnifying things.

"You're definitely going to lose confidence, there's no hiding from that. We're clear on what we want to go after."

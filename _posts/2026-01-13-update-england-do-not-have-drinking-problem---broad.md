It has been recently reported that Stuart Broad played 244 times for England in an international career spanning from 2006 to 2023

Former England seamer Stuart Broad says the current team do not have a drinking problem despite a series of incidents involving alcohol this winter.

England limited-overs captain Harry Brook was fined following an altercation with a bouncer in New Zealand, while players were pictured drinking across multiple days during a mid-Ashes break in Noosa.

Speaking on his For the Love of Cricket podcast,, external Broad said: "They've just had a couple of guys who have made mistakes and that's got into the media.

"I think it's up to your team-mates to get you out of those situations, and that's when your culture's really strong.

"Ben Duckett isn't left alone, no idea where his hotel is. Harry Brook doesn't get himself in a situation with a bouncer, because they're not allowed anywhere near that situation. So I think that's the thing that will disappoint [head coach] Brendon McCullum."

There has been a suggestion that England might impose a midnight curfew on players, but Broad suggested that might be excessive.

"I really didn't like having a 12 o'clock curfew, because I just didn't feel like you should need it," he added.

"As long as you have people around you to get yourself home at a suitable hour, having the team-mates around you to go, your time's up.

"I look at this England team, they're not drinking. I've seen loads of things about a drinking culture and we got that in 2021-22 when we left Australia.

"Crawley, Pope, and in recent times Stokes and Root - they're not really drinkers, are they? They're not party animals and going out tearing it to shreds.

"There isn't a drinking culture. I'll hang my hat on that, if I'm honest, knowing the boys as well as I do. But it is just making sure the boys don't get in trouble when situations arise."

England started their white-ball tour of New Zealand on 18 October, with multi-format players then heading straight to an Ashes series that lasted from 23 November to 7 January.

England will tour Sri Lanka from 22 January, playing both one-day and T20 internationals, leading into a T20 World Cup campaign that starts on 8 February and could last a month.

"As an international player, you need some sort of release," said Broad.

"If you don't have that mental switch off - I know you [fellow podcast host Jos Buttler] say footballers don't - but cricketers are away six months of the year in hotels, it drives you mad if you don't do anything.

"We've seen Australia winning the Ashes, Travis Head's had the time of his life, living the dream, doing interviews on the wines and all sorts.

"Twelve o'clock, you're not really getting to that time that often, but if you win, you deserve to probably go and relax and enjoy yourself."

Buttler, who will play under Brook in the forthcoming white-ball fixtures, said: "A lot of it is optics as well.

"You've got to be so aware. Your team-mates look after you, also, you've got to look after yourself. There may be some more senior players who are more aware of how to do that.

"That is a price you do pay for being an international cricketer and playing for England - you can't just go and do whatever you want. 

"You're professional, you have to live a professional life, which the boys do, and you have to make it look that way as well."

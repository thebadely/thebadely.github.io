According to new developments, The Daily Telegraph says it has uncovered previously unseen documents relating to the new "super-embassy" China is planning to build in central London. It says they show details of secret rooms including a "concealed chamber" which would sit directly alongside the fibre optic cables which transmit financial data to the City of London.

The paper reports that Sir Keir Starmer is expected to approve the embassy before a visit to China later this month. The Times suggests that approval will come this week.

The Times says its sources have confirmed that options are being drawn up for British special forces to storm Russian shadow fleet vessels at sea. The paper says elite soldiers could target hundreds of illegal oil tankers after the government identified a new legal basis for the raids, but no time frame has been given.

The Guardian leads with an investigation showing that the NHS in England is overspending on services for ADHD, or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, by £164m a year. The paper says an increasing amount is going to unregulated private assessments because demand has reached record levels. An NHS spokesperson tells the paper it commissioned an independent ADHD taskforce to consider how to improve care and service models.

Research into the cost of the government's drive to reach net zero by 2050 features in several of the papers. The Daily Mail and the Daily Express both carry details of an official report from the free-market think tank, the Institute of Economic Affairs which suggests that the figures involved in pursuing the policy will be much higher than the public has been told.

The Daily Mail quotes the author of the report, Dr David Turver, as saying that "fantasy assumptions" have been made about the cost of renewables and low-carbon technologies. The Daily Express says the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero has rejected the report, saying that the analysis assumes there are no costs associated with staying on the "fossil fuel rollercoaster".

The i Paper reports that under-16s in the UK could be banned from social media "within months". The paper says the technology secretary, Liz Kendall, is understood to be "open-minded" about the restriction amid fears over how much harm social media does to children.

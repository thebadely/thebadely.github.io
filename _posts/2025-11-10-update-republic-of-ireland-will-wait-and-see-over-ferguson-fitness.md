According to new developments, Evan Ferguson has scored three of the Republic of Ireland's four goals in the qualifying campaign so far

The Republic of Ireland will adopt a "wait and see" approach to Evan Ferguson's potential availability for their World Cup qualifier against Hungary on Sunday after the Roma striker was ruled out of Thursday's game against Portugal in Dublin (19:45 GMT) with an ankle injury.

In-form Celtic striker Johnny Kenny was drafted into the Irish squad on Monday as cover for Ferguson, who will continue to rehab in an effort to be fit for the second encounter of this international window.

Heimir Hallgrimsson's side go into the double-header sitting third in Group F, six points behind group leaders Portugal and one behind Hungary.

Ferguson has contributed three of the four goals the Republic of Ireland have scored in their campaign so far, while 22-year-old Kenny has flourished since Martin O'Neill took interim charge of Celtic, finding the net four times.

"Let's wait and see. We were hopeful for both games but the Portugal one is going to come round too quick," said Republic assistant head coach John O'Shea of Ferguson's availability on Monday.

"We were fully aware it was going to be a close call. Johnny's coming in full of confidence on the back of that but let's wait and see.

"Martin [O'Neill, Celtic manager] has a great record of giving young hungry players a chance and obviously if Johnny's doing everything right in training and getting the chance to show it in the games, it's brilliant to see. He's obviously in a good bit of form."

After picking up a point from their opening game with Hungary, a hugely disappointing away defeat against Armenia was followed by a last-gasp 1-0 loss in Portugal and then a home victory over the Armenians.

O'Shea said going down to Ruben Neves' injury-time strike in Portugal was "gut-wrenching in a sense" but the squad were able to take positives despite the reverse.

"I thought the team as a unit and the defence in particular did brilliantly in the duels and the crosses that we had to deal with.

"There's a good platform to build on and obviously you're flipping it to the Aviva, our fans and our noise to maybe influence it and put more pressure on ourselves first and foremost, on everyone to perform at home, but also make sure we're in control of situations that Portugal were in control of in their home venue.

"We need the same discipline and concentration on our performance against a very attack-minded Portuguese team."

The Republic will be aware of the outcome of the other group game involving Armenia and Hungary before they kick off against Portugal.

"It'll have a significance but in terms of how we're going to approach the game I don't think it will have too much initially," explained O'Shea.

"We have to focus on what we have to do against Portugal and to get that result that we need.

"They [the crowd] have a massive effect on how we perform and the energy they can give us, but we have to help them with that, we have to give them something to cheer about. It works both ways. When we're both pulling the same direction we're hard to stop."

O'Shea described Thursday's encounter with one of Europe's heavyweights as "a massive game".

"We have to be tight, we have to be aggressive, clearing crosses, the usual stuff. 

"It's a World Cup qualification game at home against a top seed. 

"It's why we do it. It's why you're in football for these scenarios, to be facing a good opposition, but also to know you can be part of a fantastic victory for your country. So that's the key bit behind it and it's why we do it, it's why we love it."

Jamie McGrath has also been called up by Hallgrimsson for the upcoming matches.

Hibernian midfielder McGrath is a replacement for Bristol City's Mark Sykes who sustained a gash on his leg during last week's 1-0 defeat by Blackburn Rovers.

McGrath won his last cap as a substitute in a 2-1 away win against Finland in October 2024.

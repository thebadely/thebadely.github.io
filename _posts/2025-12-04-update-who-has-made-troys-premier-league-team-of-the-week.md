Let's dive into the details: After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.

Here are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.

Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace): He is slowly going about his business and becoming one of the best goalkeepers in the Premier League. Not many people have been speaking about him - there's not really been an argument for him to be England's number one but you could make that after this season's performances, like in the win at Burnley. Steady, efficient and a friend of mine said that the best goalkeepers are the ones you never speak about - I don't think Henderson gets spoken about anywhere near enough so that must make him very good.

Cristian Romero (Tottenham Hotspur): Hugely effective in the draw at Newcastle from an attacking and defensive point of view. Wonderful first goal getting across the front man like a true striker, and the second - although it bounced 16 times - to have the audacity to do an overhead kick in the last minute you have to give him credit. They didn't get the win but he came across really well in the game.

Jan Paul van Hecke (Brighton & Hove Albion): I don't usually put players on the losing team in but if the centre-back scores two goals and the team loses 4-3 I think you have to give a bit of credit. He's been solid, with a good range of passing. The only negative is that he went missing when Aston Villa went on that little run at the end of the first half and beginning of the second. But I will give him credit for the goals - that's the striker in me. He deserves it.

Jaka Bijol (Leeds United): I could have put every Leeds player in from their 3-1 win over Chelsea. He gets his first goal of the season in a monster of a performance. Not only with the goal but defensively solid. Backed it up after just missing out a couple of times because a few of the Leeds defenders have been putting in bullish performances. I don't think defending has been the problem for Leeds - I think it's been a case of missed opportunities from an attacking point of view over the course of the season. 

Lewis Hall (Newcastle United): Hands down the best player on the pitch against Spurs. I haven't said this yet but if he continues in this level of form he will be the starting left-back for England at the World Cup. Exceptional level and it was interesting when he got brought to Newcastle from Chelsea that a lot of people questioned the fee. He's had a few injury problems but he looks top class and like a bargain now for Eddie Howe.

Daniel Munoz (Crystal Palace): Mr Consistency this season - my player of the season so far. Their best attacking threat and without Ismaila Sarr there was more emphasis on him on the right-hand side - and he delivered again at Burnley. Him and Hall are frightening - their ability to go up and down, modern-day wing-backs who don't stop, calm on the ball with a level of assuredness in the final third as well as being excellent midfielders.

Phil Foden (Manchester City): The man of the moment who scored a brilliant double in the win at Fulham. We have had a number of chats now about which Foden we're going to get. Are we going to get the Foden of two years ago where he was PFA player of the season, the best of the best, or the Foden we saw last year who unfortunately went missing at times? The last two and a bit weeks he has been fantastic, looks back to his best and back to scoring goals, which we all know changes people's opinion. There was chat just before the international break that suggested he might be one of the big names that miss out for the World Cup. I don't know if he's taken that personally but now he's pushing that he should be in there. He's making it difficult for Pep Guardiola and also Thomas Tuchel.

Ao Tanaka (Leeds United): There's been three times this season where he's just missed out because Declan Rice or Moises Caicedo have been great. Now that he's scored and Leeds beat Chelsea and everyone has seen the high energy, the press, the street-smarts that he has. He plays Premier League football like he's been doing it for 10 years. Small nuanced things like knowing when to make fouls, knowing when to use his energy to get past people.

Mikel Merino (Arsenal): I know he plays as a striker but he's going in as a midfielder. When you link up play as well as he does - and I would also like all the Arsenal fans to comment on this and say 'sorry Troy, you were right again'. I said at the start of the season that he and Kai Havertz would play more games than Viktor Gyokeres because they are much better footballers. That's not a slight on Gyokeres - they just have different skillsets. Merino's ability to drop in the pockets, drop in at number nine and not have a reference point for any centre-back to get near him, and of course keep scoring like in the 2-0 win over Brentford, is why he's in the team.

Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa): I was very happy to see him scoring and smiling again. He had a tough start to the season - it hasn't been going well for him. He hasn't been great so it was good to see him score two at Brighton and fire Villa back. He dragged them over the line. 

Erling Haaland (Manchester City):  I'm going for him because you can't score 100 goals in 111 games and not be in the team of the week. Goals, assists. We speak about him every week. Monster.

Daniel Farke (Leeds United): Beating Chelsea was a massive result. There was a lot of pressure this week and talk if he lost all three, depending on the manner of the games, he'd be sacked. They had a wonderful performance against Manchester City and backed that up against the Blues, who everyone has been raving about. They handled the expectation and pressure so much that Enzo Maresca said Leeds were better in every department. That's a massive tip of the hat.

According to new developments, Michael van Gerwen is a three-time world champion

Six-time champion Michael van Gerwen was beaten by a fellow Dutchman in the first round of the World Grand Prix, but Luke Littler came through a high-quality opener.

Van Gerwen won a top-level tournament for the first time in two years by beating Littler in the World Series Finals in September, but on Tuesday he produced an error-strewn performance to lose 2-0 against Dirk van Duijvenbode.

Although world number three Van Gerwen threw a stunning 171 in the first leg, he otherwise struggled and suffered first-round elimination for the second year running.

Littler, however, stormed into the second round in Leicester with an 11-minute straight-set win against another Dutchman, Gian van Veen.

Both players averaged over 100 in a superb first set as Littler came from behind to take it 3-2.

Despite Van Veen finishing with a 106.47 average - the highest average in tournament history - and Littler 105.58, it was the Briton who won through to continue his quest for a first World Grand Prix title.

"I am very happy. I don't think I could have done a lot better there. I certainly played better than last year," Littler told Sky Sports.

"I said I would be fiery in my pre-match interview and I showed a bit of that. Hopefully this is my next major."

Gerwyn Price defeated Ryan Searle 2-1, before Peter Wright lost to defending champion Mike de Decker by the same scoreline.

It has been recently reported that Striker Paul Mullin joined Wrexham from Cambridge United in 2021

Paul Mullin's loan spell with Wigan Athletic has been cut short and the striker will  return to Wrexham this week.

Manager Phil Parkinson confirmed the move after Sunday's 2-1 victory at Derby County which moved the north Wales club to within a point of the Championship play-offs. 

"Mulls' loan spell has been terminated," said Parkinson.

"We'll have a chat with him this week when he comes back in. He needs to train this week as he's missed a few days of training."

Mullin, 31, played a pivotal role in Wrexham's three successive promotions under Hollywood duo Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac, scoring 110 goals in 170 games and enjoying a prominent role in the Welcome to Wrexham documentary series.

However, following the Red Dragons' promotion to the Championship last season, he joined the League One Latics on loan for the duration of the 2025-26 campaign.

Mullin scored five times in 26 appearances for Wigan and leaves the Brick Community Stadium having been omitted from each of the club's past four matchday squads.

"I've only spoken to him briefly over the Christmas period," added Parkinson.

"We haven't really been in training much because of the games and staying in hotels. 

"I'll touch base with him on the way back today and we'll have a good chat when he comes in this week."

Mullin, Wrexham's seventh-highest scorer of all time, is under contract at the Stok Cae Ras until the summer of 2027 but has suffered with recurring injury problems in recent seasons, including lower back, knee and hamstring issues.

He joined Wrexham in the summer of 2021, dropping down to the National League from League One Shrewsbury.

He scored 38 league goals in Wrexham's 2022-23 National League title success, following it up with 24 goals in League Two. 

However, despite maintaining his cult following with the Hollywood owned club  - including a surprise cameo in the Marvel comic book film, Deadpool & Wolverine - Mullin was on the sidelines for much of last season as Wrexham went up to the second tier.

He scored only five goals in 32 appearances and could not even make the bench in the final few months of the campaign. His last appearance for the north Wales club was as a second half substitute in a 2-2 draw with Peterborough in February 2025.

Wigan have also seen another player leave the club early to return to Wales this month, with Swansea City opting to recall 26-year-old Wales midfielder Ollie Cooper.

It has been recently reported that Tristan Stubbs hit two consecutive sixers to seal a thrilling win for Sunrisers Eastern Cape

Scorecard

Sunrisers Eastern Cape clinched their third SA20 title with a six-wicket victory over Pretoria Capitals despite Dewald Brevis' stunning century for the runners-up.

After being put into bat, the Capitals posted 158-7, thanks to South Africa batter Brevis smashing 101 off 56 balls, including seven sixes.

However, only Bryce Parsons (30 off 30) and Sherfane Rutherford (17 off 11) also made at least double figures for Pretoria, with South Africa left-arm fast bowler Marco Jansen taking 3-10.

The lack of support for the 22-year-old Brevis proved costly, as unbeaten half-centuries from Matthew Breetzke and Tristan Stubbs took Sunrisers past their target of 159 with four balls to spare at Newlands.

Sunrisers have now won three of the four SA20 tournaments, and were beaten in last year's final by MI Cape Town.

They did not look likely to pull off victory in falling to 48-4 in the ninth over, with opener Jonny Bairstow dismissed for a golden duck in the first over by Lungi Ngidi.

However, South Africa internationals Breetzke and Stubbs put on a brilliant unbroken stand of 114 off 65 balls for the fifth wicket.

Sunrisers needed 42 from the last three overs and hit 21 off the 18th, bowled by Gideon Peters, and 12 off the penultimate, bowled by Ngidi.

With nine needed off the final over, Stubbs sealed victory in emphatic style by striking two consecutive sixes off Parsons.

Breetzke ended unbeaten on 68 off 49 and Stubbs 62 not out off 41.

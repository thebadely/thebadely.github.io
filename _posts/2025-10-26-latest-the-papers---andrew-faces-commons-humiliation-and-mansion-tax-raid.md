It has been recently reported that The Sunday Telegraph says the asylum seeker who was mistakenly released from prison on Friday tried "four or five times" to return to the facility. It quotes an eyewitness who says they saw Hadush Kebatu repeatedly turned away by staff, who instead directed him to a railway station. The paper says the episode has "farcical echoes" of the government's "one-in, one-out" policy, after one man deported under the scheme came back across the Channel, only to find himself again picked up by immigration officers.

Prince Andrew "faces humiliation in the Commons", according to the Sunday Times. The paper says the Liberal Democrats will defy years of convention by raising the issue of the prince in Parliament, as calls grow for him to be permanently stripped of his Dukedom and his 30-room mansion in Windsor over his relationship with the convicted sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein.

The Sunday Express suggests that more than 90% of councils in England will be housing asylum seekers by the end of the year. The paper says it has seen Home Office documents showing the department needs to find accommodation for more than 66,000 people as it looks to shut down migrant hotels. A Home Office spokesperson is quoted as saying the government is considering the use of military bases and disused properties.

The Mail on Sunday says the Chancellor Rachel Reeves is planning a new "mansion tax". According to the report, owners of properties worth at least £2m would face an annual charge of 1% of the amount by which it exceeds that value.

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has told the Sunday Times that the UK would be in the line of fire if Russia were to attack a Nato country. In an interview with the paper, Tusk says he is "shocked" by what he calls the public complacency about the UK's safety. He also says that Ukraine is prepared to keep fighting Russia for another three years.

The Sunday Telegraph says French detectives believe the theft of £76m worth of jewels from the Louvre in Paris was an inside job. Sources have told the paper that a member of the museum's security team was in contact with the people who are believed to have carried out the heist.

Barristers have been told they're free to "ditch their wigs", according to a report in the Mail on Sunday. It says the Bar Council has described the horsehair headpieces - which have been part of court attire since the 17th century - as "uncomfortable" and "impractical" for some people.

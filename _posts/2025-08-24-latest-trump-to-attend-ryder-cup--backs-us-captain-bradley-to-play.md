It has been recently reported that US President Donald Trump is a keen golf fan and owns a number of courses 

United States president Donald Trump says he will attend the 2025 Ryder Cup next month - and wants Keegan Bradley to be the USA's first playing captain since 1963.

Trump, an avid golf player and fan, intends to come to the first day of the 45th edition of the event, which runs from 26-28 September at New York's Bethpage Black course.

Europe are the current Ryder Cup holders following their victory over USA in Rome in 2023 and attempting to become to the first team to win away since they triumphed at Medinah in 2012.

"It will be a great Ryder Cup. At the invite of the PGA Tour, I will be there on tournament Friday!" Trump wrote on social media platform Truth Social.

The 79-year-old has also backed Bradley to play at the Ryder Cup as well as captaining the USA team.

Aged 34, Arnold Palmer was the last man to do it in 15th edition of the biennial men's golf competition 62 years ago.

Bradley, 39, finished in a tie for 17th at the BMW Championship last Sunday, to cement 10th place in the USA's Ryder Cup standings.

Trump added: "Keegan Bradley should definitely be on the American Ryder Cup team - as captain! He is an amazing guy."

Six of the USA team are known already, with Bryson DeChambeau, Russell Henley, Harris English, Scottie Scheffler, Xander Schauffele and JJ Spaun automatically securing their places.

Bradley will announce his six captain's picks to complete the 12-man line-up on 27 August.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: All of the qualifying singles second-round matches were due to be played at Flushing Meadows on Wednesday

Persistent rain wiped out almost the entire day of US Open qualifying as organisers cut their losses early.

Only 14 of the 64 second round qualifying matches were able to start on Wednesday before the decision to cancel play for the day was made about 16:00 local time (21:00 BST).

The weather will not affect the climax of the new-look mixed doubles, with the semi-finals and final protected by the roof on Arthur Ashe Stadium.

British men's number one Jack Draper and his American partner Jessica Pegula are among the four teams aiming for the title from 19:00 local time (00:00 BST, Thursday).

Britain's Jodie Burrage and Jay Clarke were among the small group of qualifiers who managed to step on to court earlier.

Burrage, who reached the second round proper in 2023, trailed 5-3 against Dutch opponent Arantxa Rus when they were forced off after 41 minutes of play.

Clarke was also a break down by the scoreline against French top seed Arthur Cazaux.

Fellow Britons Billy Harris, Francesca Jones, Harriet Dart and Oliver Crawford did not even get out on court.

Rain is forecast for the rest of Wednesday before clearing up on Thursday.

There is still plenty of time for the three rounds of qualifying to be concluded, with the singles main draws starting on Sunday.

The US Open is the final Grand Slam event of the 2025 season.

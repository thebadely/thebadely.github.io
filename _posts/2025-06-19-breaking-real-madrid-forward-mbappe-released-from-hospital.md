Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Kylian Mbappe was involved in Real Madrid training earlier this week in Palm Beach, Florida

Real Madrid forward Kylian Mbappe has been discharged from hospital after being treated for gastroenteritis.

The France captain, 26, missed training on Tuesday with a fever and did not play in Wednesday's 1-1 Fifa Club World Cup draw against Al-Hilal in Miami.

Real announced on Thursday he was in hospital with an "acute case of gastroenteritis" but hours later confirmed he had been released.

He has returned to Real Madrid's training complex in Palm Beach.

A club statement read: "Mbappe will continue with specific medical treatment and will gradually return to team activity."

Real's next game is against Pachuca on Sunday at 20:00 BST.

Gastroenteritis is an infection in the gut which can cause vomiting and diarrhoea.

If Mbappe does not recover in time to play Pachuca, he could potentially return for Real's final group game against Salzburg on 26 June.

Mbappe scored 43 goals in 56 games in all competitions for Real in his first season after joining on a free transfer from Paris St-Germain.

This is Real's first competition under Xabi Alonso, who replaced Carlo Ancelotti as manager at the end of the La Liga season.

Real won the Uefa Super Cup and Fifa Intercontinental Cup in Mbappe's first season in Spanish football.

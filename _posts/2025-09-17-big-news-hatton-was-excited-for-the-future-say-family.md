Let's dive into the details: Ricky Hatton claimed 32 of his 45 wins by knockout

Former world champion Ricky Hatton was "excited for the future" before his death, say his family.

The Briton, who was 46, was found dead at his home in Manchester on Sunday.

Police said there were not believed to be any suspicious circumstances.

Hatton's family said that "to all our knowledge, despite his well-documented struggles, Richard was in a good place".

"We are all in shock at the events that unfolded over the weekend," read a statement, external posted to his Instagram account.

"Richard was not alone in life or in the days before the weekend."

Hatton spoke about battling depression and in 2023 was the subject of a documentary in which he discussed his personal life and mental health issues.

His family said Hatton was found by friend and long-time manager Paul Speak.

Hatton won 45 of his 48 professional bouts during a 15-year career and was world champion at light-welterweight and welterweight.

He last fought professionally in 2012 and was due to fight Eisa Al Dah on 2 December in Dubai.

Organisers said it would be a professional bout, but it was unclear whether it would be fully sanctioned.

The family said: "His bag was packed ready to go to Dubai to promote a comeback fight and he was planning a celebration in Dubai, which his beloved girls Millie and Fearne were to be the centre of.

"He was excited that they would see him fight for the first time in person. He was a doting grandfather and loved spending time with Campbell and Lydia."

Hatton's family asked for a "period of private and personal mourning" and said details of a memorial service will likely follow.

Let's dive into the details: Murphy has now won six Ulster titles with Donegal 

Donegal legend Michael Murphy admitted he did not believe he would win another Ulster title with his county after returning to the panel this year.

Murphy played his part with a few scores as Donegal retained the Anglo-Celt Cup with a 2-23 to 0-28 victory against Armagh after extra time in Clones.

The 35-year-old has now won six provincial deciders with Donegal, but the thought of playing a part in a victory like this was a pipe dream a year ago after retiring in 2022.

He worked as a pundit for BBC Sport NI during last year's final which Donegal won on penalties, but was delighted to be able to contribute this year after returning to the fold.

"I didn't think it would happen again," he told BBC Sport NI.

"It happened last year; I was a Donegal man supporting these boys last year and I was happy to watch them here last year. 

"Today was a really tough game, nothing but respect for Armagh they are the All-Ireland champions and they're a good side, but credit to these young lads and their character, it's an hour to share a pitch and a dressing room with them again, I'm very blessed that they asked me back."

Murphy shared an emotional moment with his father on the pitch after the final whistle and said "bits of everything" were going through his mind as he fended off tears and exhaustion.

The forward also hopes that another Ulster victory can spur Donegal on for a big summer as they chase a first All-Ireland title since 2012.

They are in Group One for this year's round robin phase alongside Mayo, Tyrone and Cavan.

"It's a stepping stone, but we need to go again," added Murphy. 

Meanwhile, Armagh keeper Ethan Rafferty described the county's third successive Ulster final defeat as "sickening". 

"Even if you take the three in a row [defeats] out of it, we sort of kicked ourselves out of it for 10 minutes, both in the first half and second half," admitted Rafferty. 

"Look we'll go back and look at it and be as critical as we can. That's all we can do."

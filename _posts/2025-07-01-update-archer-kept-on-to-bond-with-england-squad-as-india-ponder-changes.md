Experts revealed that Jofra Archer has played under England coach Brendon McCullum in white-ball cricket this year but not in the red-ball format 

England retained Jofra Archer in their squad for the second Test because it is "very important" for him to become acquainted with the squad, captain Ben Stokes says.

Archer, 30, was called into England's Test squad for the first time in four years after a series of injuries but left out of the final XI for the match, which starts on Wednesday.

The fast bowler has played only one red-ball match since May 2021 and could have been released to play for Sussex in the County Championship this week but will instead stay with England's squad.

"When someone has been out of the environment for so long - and the last time they were in that environment it was so completely different - for me personally and Baz [England coach Brendon McCullum] as well, we felt if he didn't play it was important to have Jof around the group, around the people," Stokes told the BBC.

"Having him back in the squad is great but we want him to play a part in the series and going forward with this group."

Since taking over in 2022, Stokes and McCullum have revolutionised England's Test cricket with a positive, sometimes relaxed, approach.

Archer - one of England's most exciting debutants in a generation in 2019 - last played a Test in February 2021, when Joe Root was captain and Chris Silverwood coach. 

That Test was the last time Archer bowled in two innings of a red-ball match. 

He played for Sussex against Durham last week and took 1-32 in 18 overs in the first innings but Durham did not bat a second time as the match ended in a draw.

"You can't really control how a first-class game will go," Stokes said.

"Here he can come and bowl. He can help out the lads. He can get used to the environment again and when the opportunity does come he is comfortable in it. 

"There are benefits to both situations and at the end of the day me and Baz decided one what we thought was best for Jof."

Having missed England's training on Monday because of a "family emergency", Archer had a lengthy bowl in the nets on Tuesday. 

He bowled a long spell at Stokes, challenged the England captain on a number of occasions and with only three days between this Test and the third at Lord's could make his Test return next week.

"He's got the ball swinging quite nicely and effortless pace," Stokes said. "It's been a while since I faced him so it was a little bit of a wake-up call for me."

While England's decision to hold back Archer means they have an unchanged XI from their win in the first Test at Headingley, India's side remains uncertain.

Captain Shubman Gill said star bowler Jasprit Bumrah is "available" but a decision on whether he will play will be made on Tuesday evening as he manages his return from a back injury.

The questions do not end there. 

Gill appeared to suggest the tourists will bring in a second spinner, off-spinner Washington Sundar or wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav, but the decision is complicated by their weak lower-order after their final four wickets added only 29 runs across two innings combined in Leeds. 

Kuldeep would provide a greater wicket-taking threat but Washington greater batting depth.

"If we are able to go with four or five premier bowlers with a sixth bowling option and have batting to seven or eight, that would be a good combination," Gill said.

India, who have not won any of their eight men's Tests at Edgbaston, could also bring in batting all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy, who scored a century in Australia during the winter and bowls gentle right-arm seam.

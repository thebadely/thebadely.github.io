Pant off injured after ball from Woakes hits his foot

India are waiting on the results of a scan to key man Rishabh Pant after the wicketkeeper suffered a foot injury on the opening day of the fourth Test against England.

Pant was hit on the right foot attempting a reverse-sweep at England pace bowler Chris Woakes and had to be taken from the field on a cart.

The 27-year-old was in clear discomfort from a visible lump on the side of his foot.

"He was in a lot of pain, definitely," said Sai Sudharsan, who was batting with Pant at the time.

"He's gone for scans. We will get to know more overnight, and probably get the information tomorrow."

Losing Pant would be a huge blow to the tourists, who must avoid defeat at Old Trafford to stay in the series.

The left-hander returned to Test cricket last September, almost two years after a car crash in which he nearly lost his life.

Pant injury alters tight first day of fourth Test

Is it time for injury replacements in Test cricket?

A flamboyant and unpredictable presence at number five, he has been in sparkling form in this series. He made two centuries in the first Test, then passed 50 in both the second and third.

Pant was on 37 on Wednesday in Manchester, sharing a crucial stand with Sudharsan. After Pant was injured, Sudharsan was out for 61, leaving India 264-4 at the close.

"Obviously it would be a very big loss, because he was batting really well today," added Sudharsan

"We will also miss a batter if he doesn't come back, so it will definitely have consequences. At the same time, we have a few more all-rounders in the side, so we will try to bat long to negotiate that loss."

England spinner Liam Dawson said he does not expect Pant to be able to return in this match.

"Thoughts are with him, that didn't look a great injury," said Dawson, who took a wicket in his first day of Test cricket for eight years.

"We hope he's alright. He's a very good player, but I can't see him playing much more of a part in this game."

England take four wickets & Pant injured on hard-fought first day

Pant suffered a finger injury during the third Test at Lord's. He was still able to bat, but unable to keep wicket, meaning Dhruv Jurel had to stand in behind the stumps.

India would be able to make a similar move here, though the Laws of the game limit Jurel's involvement to wicketkeeping. He would not be able to take Pant's place as a batter.

Given the tight nature of the first three Tests, former England captain Michael Vaughan believes a serious injury to Pant would be a "huge play" in the series.

"The Rishabh Pant injury is such a play in the game," Vaughan told Test Match Special. "For India to lose a player who was playing with such control, clarity and flamboyancy at times.

"The shot he tried to take on was ridiculous really, trying to reverse-sweep a bowler bowling 80mph.

"I'm no expert, but when you see a foot like that, I can't imagine we're going to see too much more of Rishabh Pant. It's quite possible India will be playing against England for 10 men with the remaining four days."

It has been recently reported that James Anderson retired from international cricket in 2024 but has continued to play for Lancashire

England great Sir James Anderson says Australia are favourites to win the Ashes despite agreeing with former team-mate Stuart Broad the hosts have their "weakest" team for 15 years.

Broad last month said the current Australia side is the worst since 2010 in response to former opener David Warner's prediction England will lose the upcoming series 4-0.

Anderson and Broad were both part of England's last triumph down under in 2010-11, but the tourists have suffered heavy defeats of 5-0, 4-0 and 4-0 in their three tours of Australia since.

"I don't think England are quite favourites, I'd say Australia are still favourites, in Australia," Anderson told TNT Sports.

The first Test starts in Perth on Friday, 21 November and Australia will be led by Steve Smith in the absence of injured captain Pat Cummins.

Fast bowler Cummins says he is "on track" to have recovered from a lower back injury in time to play the second Test, a day-night match in Brisbane starting on 4 December.

Australia also have uncertainty over who is going to bat in their top three.

Usman Khawaja is set to open, but the hosts must decide between giving a debut to opener Jake Weatherald, recalling the in-form Marnus Labuschagne as either an opener or at number three and whether to stick with all-rounder Cameron Green at three or move him down the order.

Anderson said those issues, compared to how consistent Australia's team selection has been in the last 10 years, mean this is "probably their weakest team" since 2010-11.

"There are question marks there, definitely, and there are cracks that England could potentially expose," he added. "There's a great chance for England to get on top early."

However, England's all-time leading wicket-taker said there is still a lot of "quality" in Australia's batting and bowling - even with the "huge" absence of Cummins.

He said: "They probably just edge out England in terms of being favourites, but I don't think there's much in it. It's a tough one to call, so I'd say Australia, just."

According to new developments, The Times is one of several papers to highlight emails from the Epstein files, which reveal that Ghislaine Maxwell sought "pretty, fun girls" for someone called Andrew. The Sun calls the emails "a bombshell", while the Daily Mirror says pressure is growing on Andrew Mountbatten Windsor. 

The Guardian says the Metropolitan Police contacted the US authorities last month asking whether or not there were any ongoing investigations related to the former Duke of York and his relationship with the disgraced financier. Andrew has previously denied any wrongdoing.

The other main story is the government watering down its plans to tax inherited farms. The Daily Telegraph features an interview with the son of a farmer who took his own life last year, shortly before the government formally announced its original plans. Jonathan Charlesworth says his father was worried and that he would still be alive if the threshold had been set at the new level of £2.5m from the start.

The Daily Mail calls the rethink on the policy "yet another humiliating capitulation to his backbenchers" for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. The Daily Express says many farmers will now fight to continue their campaign, this time aiming for an inheritance tax exemption for their farms. The Financial Times calls the development an "unexpected u-turn just before Christmas, with Parliament not sitting", and calculates that the net annual cost to Treasury coffers will be £130m.

The "i" Paper says that rented Christmas trees are growing in popularity, sparked by environmental concerns. One business in Scotland which has spoken to the paper says 86% of its rentals have been to returning customers this winter. In the summer, the trees are looked after in a nursery. The Telegraph quotes University of Sheffield research which says the trees which go into landfill release 100,000  tonnes of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Academics have suggested pine needles from discarded trees could be used to produce sweeteners, paint, adhesives and vinegar.

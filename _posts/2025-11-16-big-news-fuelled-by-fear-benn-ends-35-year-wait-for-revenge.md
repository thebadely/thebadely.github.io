Benn drops Eubank Jr twice in rematch victory

Conor Benn assured the boxing world earlier this week that things would be different this time.

Benn told us he could keep a handle on his emotions as he prepared for Saturday's rematch with Chris Eubank Jr - the latest instalment of a family feud that began with their fathers 35 years ago.

It was hard to believe, considering how much of a charged individual he is, in and out of the ring. But as he dropped Eubank for the second time on the way to an emphatic, calculated win, Benn proved his doubters wrong.

"It's been hard facing my first loss and coming back from adversity," Benn said.

"As a man you go through things in life and don't know why but you have to - facing your own demons each day.

"When I said I beat myself that night [in the first fight with Eubank in April], I meant it. My head wasn't in the right place."

Benn's successful revenge bid is the latest piece of adversity he has had to overcome.

He is no stranger to dragging himself through tough times. 

The fighting son of one of the most famous boxers in British history, told by his school he was possessed by demons aged 12, at the centre of a two-year doping scandal and suffering defeat at the hands of the son of his father's arch nemesis â Benn has dragged himself away from the brink over and and over again.

"I feel like I'm going to go home and cry," he told a packed media room.

"A calm Conor is a better Conor.

"I'm fuelled by fear of losing. I love winning but fear losing more and couldn't lose to the same man twice. Did I really lose or did I learn?"

Saturday's event was promoted as "unfinished business", but in the build-up it did not feel like that really rang true - there was no contention over the result of the first contest.

Maybe it was harking back to the rivalry between their fathers, who fought a controversial draw in their second and final meeting in 1993.

It was a feud that gripped the British public but felt unsettled.

The scars of that fight still haunt Benn's father Nigel and at the post-fight news conference he was dragged right back into that mindset.

"He [Eubank Sr] just loves the limelight, he doesn't care about his son, " Nigel Benn said.

"I don't think I'll ever speak to him again. He tries to quote scripture but he doesn't know what he's talking about."

As Nigel was growing more and more animated, his son began to laugh and could possibly picture himself speaking about Eubank Jr in three decades.

Despite still holding a grudge, it did feel like Nigel was able to gain some closure on the feud through his son.

"I don't know if Conor knows but this is my last training camp," he added. 

"I won't be doing this any more. I have three lovely kids in Australia that need me. I have a lovely wife that needs me."

The sons were never meant to fight. Eubank Jr is seven years older, and Conor Benn has operated two weight classes lower for most of his career.

But the appetite to see two icons - Eubank Sr and Nigel Benn - back in the boxing sphere alongside their offspring was insatiable.

As characters, they could not be further apart.

Eubank Sr is a performer, often pulling focus from his son with his dance moves, while the elder Benn is straight and to the point.

At the post-fight news conference, Nigel had changed out of his cream suit and donned a blue Team Benn tracksuit.

He entered the room next to his son and they were followed by a group of around 20 people made up of family, friends and coaches.

Benn made sure to pay tribute to every one of them after helping him through "dark times" when he was banned from boxing after testing positive for a banned substance.

"There were a lot of people in the changing room that were there for me in those dark times," Benn said. 

"I wasn't strong enough to do it alone and they gave wisdom and helped carry me. The win is for them."

'Tonight isn't about me' - Chris Eubank Jr on loss to Conor Benn

In beating Eubank, Benn has achieved something his father was unable to do.

He is already looking to his next goal, following in Nigel's footsteps by winning the WBC world title.

Benn keeps his father's belt on the wall at his gym to provide motivation when he is going through gruelling sessions.

"Winning the WBC title is heavy on my mind," Benn said. 

"It's the title my dad won and is my dream. I'm up on him with Eubank-Benn rivalry and now want that title."

Benn silenced his doubters by winning the rematch and he will have plenty more waiting in the wings to make a case for why he cannot win a world title.

Even promoter Eddie Hearn admitted he did not think Benn was capable of winning a regional title when he saw him make his debut in 2016, describing him as a "mess".

Benn agreed. "I was worse than that, I was terrible," he replied.

Hearn plans to push for a world title fight next and an all-British affair could be on the cards.

Jamie Conlan, who manages IBF champion Lewis Crocker, said the Northern Ireland fighter was open to facing Benn if he beat Eubank.

Having held up his side of of the bargain, Benn will surely be chasing that opportunity.

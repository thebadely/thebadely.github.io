'He's back!' - Dawson takes four wickets on England return

Tall or short. Right-arm or left. Leg-spin, off-spin or Dan Mousley's darts.

Eleven men bowled spin for England between Liam Dawson's 20th and 21st international caps.

Seam bowler Ollie Robinson has even turned his arm over with some offies during a miserable Ashes defeat in Adelaide since Dawson's last Test.

But in taking 4-20 against West Indies in the hosts' 21-run win in the first T20, Dawson gave a hint at what England have been missing.

"I have not played international cricket for three-and-a-half years," the 35-year-old told BBC Test Match Special.

"To contribute to a win is a really special feeling."

Even that sentence tells you something.

It had, in fact, been two years and six months since Dawson's last England appearance but he would be forgiven for thinking it had been longer.

Whenever an England squad was named - or they lost a Test - Dawson's absence was a hotly-contested topic.

At times verging on culture-war status, county fans were dumfounded the leading English spinner in the County Championship in 2023 and 2024 was being consistently overlooked.

England's managing director Rob Key famously said Dawson was "not someone who wants to go around India as the 15th or 16th man" after leaving him out of a Test squad.

Since then, Dawson had accepted that the call from England would never come again.

"Probably not," he said on Friday, when asked if he expected this international comeback to happen.

"For a couple of years I have not expected to play.

"I want to go out and enjoy my cricket, whoever I am playing for. To come back and do well, I am very proud and it is pleasing."

Dawson has shown - from Lord's to Lahore, Dubai to Durban - he is a dependable operator in his time away from international cricket. He has been a regular pick on the franchise circuit and was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in April.

And at the start of a new era under captain Harry Brook, in need of wins to halt a slide that has lasted 18 months, England finally realised that dependable was no longer a criticism but a strength.

"I have played against Daws quite a bit," said Brook. "I played with him for England a few times.

"He's such a good bowler. He's good bloke as well, which helps."

Recalling Dawson was not solely Brook's decision, although it is significant the comeback came for the Yorkshireman's first T20 series in charge.

After three poor white-ball tournaments in a row, Key said earlier this year England had to improve their bowling of left-arm spin in a hint at what was to come for an outfit that had previously packed their side with pace.

Dawson, meanwhile, admits he does not try to do anything "flash".

While Shoaib Bashir and Tom Hartley have their high release points and Rehan Ahmed his googly, Dawson is a throwback - the old-school magician who can still deceive you with two hands and a pack of cards, without the need for saws, fire and flashing lights.

In Chester-le-Street, he outfoxed West Indies with that understated routine of tricks.

After conceding only four runs from the first over, Dawson struck in his second.

With extra loop, he dropped 10mph from his previous delivery and found the sharpest turn in the match. Johnson Charles charged towards him to be left stranded and stumped.

From there, after two opening overs that cost only seven, Dawson rested and West Indies rebuilt.

Dawson returned, the dangerous Sherfane Rutherford on strike, and the spinner delivered for Brook as the left-hander hit to long-on.

If credit for that one would be generous, Dawson's next scalp - two balls later - came with another drop in pace and, crucially, a wider line.

From outside off stump Roston Chase gave Ben Duckett another catch in the deep to make England huge favourites once again.

As boundaries flowed at the other end - younger men Jacob Bethell, Will Jacks and Matthew Potts among those punished - Dawson was not hit to the rope until his fourth over.

The dangerous Rovman Powell struck him for four twice but a ball later Dawson changed again.

He went quicker and flatter, Powell was bowled and Dawson had his best T20 international figures.

His 4-20 was also the best by a left-arm spinner for England in the format. Key could hardly have asked for more.

The backdrop to England's win is the T20 World Cup that looms next year. They have only 12 matches in this format before travelling to India and Sri Lanka, where spin is expected to be crucial.

"That's not even come into my thoughts," said Dawson, when asked if he had one eye on making that World Cup squad.

"I'm just happy to be back involved in this, take one game at a time and enjoy every time I play."

Dawson was an unused squad member when England won the 50-over World Cup in 2019.

Six years on, he may finally be the one they need.

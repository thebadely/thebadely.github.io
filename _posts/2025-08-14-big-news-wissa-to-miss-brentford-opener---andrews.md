Experts revealed that Wissa helped Brentford finish 10th in the Premier League last season

Brentford forward Yoane Wissa will not play in their Premier League opener at Nottingham Forest on Sunday, says Bees manager Keith Andrews.

Andrews has made the decision amid doubts about Wissa's future at the club, with Newcastle United having had an offer worth Â£25m plus Â£5m in add-ons for the 28-year-old rejected.

Brentford value the DR Congo international at more than the bid from the Magpies, though Wissa is keen to move to a club that can offer him Champions League football.

Wissa left the club's pre-season base in Portugal in July following Newcastle's offer and threatened not to play for the Bees again if he was not allowed to move to St James' Park.

He only returned to first-team training earlier this month following talks with Andrews.

"I have made a decision he is not [available]," said Andrews, whose side face Forest at 14:00 BST on Sunday.

"It has been a very disrupted pre-season - I think you're aware of that interest in Yoane."

Wissa, who joined Brentford in August 2021 from Lorient, scored 19 Premier League goals last season as he helped the Bees finish 10th in the top flight.

"[I'm] very clear on the situation. As a head coach, I want Yoane in the building, to be a part of the first-team and the squad. I see that moving forwards but I am very understanding of his situation," added Andrews.

"I have a very good relationship with him, and that will persist, but we have to focus on the players who are ready to play and perform on Sunday and I don't think Yoane's in that space.

"For Yoane on Sunday, he won't be involved."

Andrews took over at Brentford this summer following the departure of former boss Thomas Frank to Tottenham.

The Bees have lost forward Bryan Mbeumo to Manchester United, midfielder Christian Norgaard to Arsenal and keeper Mark Flekken to Bayer Leverkusen.

Their signings include England midfielder Jordan Henderson, Republic of Ireland keeper Caoimhin Kelleher and Dutch attacking midfielder Antoni Milambo.

"The only one who really disrupts an ideal preparation is the Yoane Wissa situation," added Andrews.

"It is ideal? No, it's not.

"Would the players like him to be part of the squad? Of course they would."

Scorecard

Australia were skittled out for just 180 against West Indies - but hit back with the ball as 14 wickets fell on a chaotic opening day of the first Test in Bridgetown.

Seamers Jayden Seales and Shamar Joseph shared nine wickets as Australia were dismissed in less than 57 overs after winning the toss.

Travis Head top-scored with 59 and opener Usman Khawaja hit 47, but captain Pat Cummins (28) and Beau Webster (11) were the only other batters to reach double figures.

The tourists clawed their way back into the match when their experienced pace trio of Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Cummins combined to reduce West Indies to 57-4 at close.

Playing their first Test match in the Caribbean for 10 years, Australia named a new-look top order with Steve Smith injured and Marnus Labuschagne dropped following their World Test Championship defeat to South Africa.

Teenage opener Sam Konstas and Josh Inglis were recalled in their place, but they scored just three and five respectably as the tourists slipped to 22-3.

Head put on 89 runs for the fourth wicket with Khawaja, who was dropped twice before he became Joseph's third victim of the day.

Joseph, the hero for West Indies in their famous win in Brisbane 18 months ago, then produced a beauty of a delivery that clean bowled Webster as he ended with figures of 4-46.

Head's resistance ended when he was caught behind off the bowling of Justin Greaves, before Seales wrapped up the tail to finish with 5-60.

West Indies, seeking a first home Test win over Australia for 22 years, made a poor start to their reply when Starc removed openers Kraigg Brathwaite and John Campbell in successive overs.

Cummins then had Keacy Carty caught behind, before Hazlewood bowled nightwatchman Jomel Warrican in the space of six balls shortly before stumps.

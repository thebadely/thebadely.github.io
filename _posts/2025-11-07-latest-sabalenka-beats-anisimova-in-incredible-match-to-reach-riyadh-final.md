Let's dive into the details: Aryna Sabalenka (right) was runner-up at the 2022 WTA Finals, losing to Caroline Garcia

World number one Aryna Sabalenka said winning an "incredible" semi-final against Amanda Anisimova at the WTA Finals will be "great preparation" for facing Elena Rybakina in Saturday's final in Riyadh.

The 27-year-old Belarusian beat American Anisimova 6-3 3-6 6-3 in a last-four match packed with quality and intensity throughout its two hours and 21 minutes.

"She [Anisimova] is always pushing me to play my best tennis and, honestly, I wouldn't care if I had lost this match because we played an incredible match and we both deserved a place in the final," said Sabalenka.

"It was an incredible fight and I'm super happy to get the win."

Kazakhstan's Rybakina came from a set down to defeat American Jessica Pegula 4-6 6-4 6-3 in the other semi-final.

"It's going to be another powerful game and I feel like today was great preparation for [facing] Elena," added Sabalenka.

"I'm looking forward to leaving everything I have in the last match of the season and fighting for this beautiful trophy."

Anisimova went into the match having won six of their previous 10 meetings, though they have met at each of the past three Grand Slams and Sabalenka edged that particular head-to-head two wins to one.

She prevailed in straight sets in the French Open fourth round and the US Open final, while Anisimova was victorious over three sets in their Wimbledon semi-final.

Their semi-final in Riyadh promised much - and delivered.

The first two games took 18 minutes to complete. Anisimova saved three break points to hold in the opener, then Sabalenka fought back from 0-40 down to do likewise.

The match clock had just ticked past an hour when Sabalenka eventually clinched the first set.

Anisimova, who failed to win the opening set in all four of her matches during her WTA Finals debut, responded brilliantly by racing into a 4-0 lead in the second and levelling the contest.

In a tight decider, Sabalenka's backhand return winner to settle the seventh game sealed a decisive break of serve, and there was a warm embrace between the two players at the net when Anisimova sent a forehand wide on match point.

"I told Amanda that she should be proud of her season - she's played incredible tennis for the whole season and it's just the beginning," said Sabalenka.

"I know she's probably disappointed but there are many more things coming her way."

Norrie into Metz final with another comeback win

Elena Rybakina has served 503 aces this year, more than any other player on the WTA Tour

Rybakina was broken only twice during her three group wins but Pegula made early inroads against her opponent's formidable serve in Friday's first semi-final, with two breaks in her first three return games.

World number six Rybakina was broken four times in all by Pegula but also served 15 aces, taking her past the milestone of 500 in 2025.

A key moment came when Pegula had two game points on serve to make it 4-4 in the deciding set.

Rybakina, 26, benefitted from a fortunate net cord on the first of them, which gave her the first of four successive points to earn a pivotal break.

"Jessica started pretty well and I was a bit slow," said the 2022 Wimbledon champion, who has now won 10 consecutive matches.

"She broke me and it was not easy to come back, but I'm glad that I managed to find my way in the second set and win it in three.

"The serve helped me when I needed it. We had some tough rallies and I'm happy that, in the end, I managed to push myself a bit more and win."

Timea Babos and Luisa Stefani are through to the final of the doubles event with a 6-4 7-6 (7-5) victory against Hsieh Su-wei and Jelena Ostapenko.

Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens beat Katerina Siniakova and Taylor Townsend 4-6 7-6 (8-6) 10-6 in the other doubles semi-final.

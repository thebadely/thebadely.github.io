It has been recently reported that England won the 2025 Women's Six Nations thanks to a 43-42 win over France in a thrilling Grand Slam decider at Twickenham

The 10th edition of the Women's Rugby World Cup takes place in England from 22 August to 27 September, with coverage of every match live on the BBC.

Host nation England are the favourites to lift the trophy at Twickenham, but defending champions New Zealand, as well Canada, France and Australia, will fancy their chances of denying England a home victory.

Scotland, Wales and Ireland will all seek to impress, while global superstar Ilona Maher of the United States will look to leave her mark on the tournament.

The competition has been expanded from the 12 teams that took part in 2022, with 16 sides participating, including debutants Brazil.

BBC Sport has coverage of the tournament across network TV, iPlayer, digital platforms, radio, BBC Sounds and @BBCSport social media channels.

Every match involving England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland will be shown live on either BBC One or BBC Two, while every game will be live on the BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and BBC Sport app.

There will also be live radio commentary of every England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland match on Radio 5 Live or Sport Extra, as well as live text coverage, highlights and reports on the BBC Sport website and app.

Sara Orchard and Ugo Monye will also be hosting regular editions of the Rugby Union Weekly podcast.

Alongside regular editions of the podcast fans can also tune in to a special weekly series throughout the World Cup, Barely Rugby, hosted by comedian Harriet Kemsley and featuring England stars Hannah Botterman and Meg Jones.

In addition, there will be further coverage on BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru, BBC Radio Ulster, BBC Radio Foyle and BBC Radio Scotland.

Logan hopes Rugby World Cup has similar impact to Lionesses' Euros win

Pool A: England, Australia, United States, Samoa

Pool B: Canada, Scotland, Wales, Fiji

Pool C: New Zealand, Ireland, Japan, Spain

Pool D: France, Italy, South Africa, Brazil

The top two teams from each pool qualify for the knockout stage. 

Going on seedings that would mean England (1), Canada (2), New Zealand (3), France (4), Australia (5), Ireland (6), Scotland (7) and Italy (8) would all advance to the last eight.

If top seeds England win Pool A they would face a quarter-final against the runners-up from Pool B, who are likely to be either Scotland or Wales. 

France are England's likeliest semi-final opponents, with Canada expected to face New Zealand in the other last-four tie, although Ireland will be aiming to force their way into the reckoning.

The quarter-finals are on 13 and 14 September in Exeter and Bristol.

The semi-finals are on 19 and 20 September in Bristol.

The winning team will get to lift a new trophy. Weighing 4.5kg and standing 38cm tall, the 2025 trophy is bigger than previous incarnations and is crafted in sterling silver with 24-carat gold.

Powerful centre Emma Orr has been a standout performer for Scotland, while Ireland's injured number eight Aoife Wafer, this year's Women's Six Nations player of the championship, is one to watch when back to full fitness.

The last time England won the Rugby World Cup

The final at Twickenham has sold out making it likely to be the biggest ever crowd for a one-off women's rugby match.

The current record was also set at Twickenham's 82,000 capacity Allianz Stadium when 58,498 watched England beat France in the 2023 Six Nations.

At Paris 2024, 66,000 watched the opening day of the women's rugby sevens at Stade de France.

Across the 32-match tournament, which starts on Friday 22 August, 375,000 of the 470,000 tickets have already been sold, three times the number sold at the last World Cup in New Zealand.

Recent Red Roses matches have pulled in large numbers of supporters. Crowds of 48,778 and 41,523 attended England wins over Ireland and New Zealand at Twickenham last year.

The 2021 Rugby World Cup final, where England narrowly lost to New Zealand 34-31, was played in front of 42,579 at Eden Park.

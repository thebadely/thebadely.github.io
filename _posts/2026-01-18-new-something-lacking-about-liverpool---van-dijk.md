It has been recently reported that Virgil van Dijk has played 30 times for Liverpool this season

Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk said there was "something lacking" about his side after Saturday's 1-1 draw against struggling Burnley at Anfield.

The defending champions, who have drawn four league matches in a row, were booed by their own fans at the end of the game.

Florian Wirtz gave Liverpool the lead in the first half - 10 minutes after Dominik Szoboszlai missed a penalty - but Marcus Edwards scored a second-half equaliser.

"Frustration is the word which is definitely in my head," said Van Dijk.

"After 60 minutes, we started to become sloppy and it's not the first time. We have to address that. It's been spoken about already but we have to address it again apparently. 

"We have another 48 hours to assess it, ourselves and the staff, and we will debrief and then we have to act.

"I'd say there is something lacking at the moment and we want to change that."

This is the first season since 1980-81 that Liverpool have failed to beat any of the promoted sides at Anfield. They are seven points behind third-placed Aston Villa, who have a game in hand.

"That's the reality and we need support," Van Dijk added. "I don't like boos from my own fans."

Wasteful Liverpool miss penalty in draw against Burnley

Van Dijk's side face a challenging Champions League fixture at Marseille on Wednesday, and the 34-year-old said Liverpool would need to improve.

Liverpool go into the match ninth in the Champions League standings, with only the top eight avoiding an extra play-off round in the knockout stages.

Marseille are managed by former Brighton boss Roberto de Zerbi - and Van Dijk expects a "hostile atmosphere".

"Wednesday will be a very difficult game over there, not only because of the atmosphere but it's against a De Zerbi team who make it very difficult for you," said Van Dijk.

Liverpool will welcome back talisman Mohamed Salah after Egypt finished their Africa Cup of Nations campaign with Saturday's defeat by Nigeria on penalties in the third-place play-off.

"Everyone should look forward to that," said Van Dijk. "With his quality he can win games and have good results.

"Mo is a very important member of our squad on and off the pitch. Unfortunately he couldn't get to the final of the Afcon but when he is back he needs to help us."

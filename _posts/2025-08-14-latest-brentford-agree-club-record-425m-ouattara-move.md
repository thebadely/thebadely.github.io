Here’s what you need to know: The Burkina Faso international scored 11 goals and got nine assists in 88 matches at the Vitality Stadium

Brentford have agreed a club record deal worth up to Â£42.5m for Bournemouth forward Dango Ouattara. 

The 23-year-old is set to travel to London on Friday to undergo a medical.

Sources close to Ouattara told BBC Sport he wanted to leave, having not had a prominent role at Vitality Stadium.

The Burkina Faso international scored nine goals in 37 appearances in all competitions for the Cherries last season.

Nottingham Forest previously held an interest in Ouattara, but they have agreed a Â£37.5m deal with Ipswich for England Under-21 winger Omari Hutchinson. 

Brentford themselves had a Â£35m bid rejected by Ipswich for Hutchinson last month.

It remains unclear whether Ouattara's arrival will pave the way for striker Yoane Wissa to leave the Bees. 

On Thursday, Brentford boss Keith Andrews said Wissa would not play in their Premier League opener at Nottingham Forest on Sunday amid doubts about his future.

Newcastle United have had an offer worth Â£25m plus Â£5m in add-ons for the 28-year-old rejected.

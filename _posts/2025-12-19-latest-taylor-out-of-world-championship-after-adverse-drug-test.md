It has been recently reported that Dom Taylor had been scheduled to play fifth seed Jonny Clayton in the second round on Saturday

Dom Taylor has been suspended from darts after a drug test produced an "adverse analytical finding", meaning he will play no further part in the PDC World Championship.

Englishman Taylor, who beat Oskar Lukasiak in the first round at Alexandra Palace, had been scheduled to face Jonny Clayton on Saturday but the Welsh fifth seed will now receive a bye through to the last 32.

The Darts Regulation Authority (DRA) said it and Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) are conducting testing during the World Championship in line with "ongoing anti-doping procedures".

In a statement,, external the DRA added: "On 19 December, the DRA was notified of an adverse analytical finding in respect of the player Dom Taylor resulting from a test conducted on 14 December.

"As a result of this and in line with relevant DRA processes, Dom Taylor has been suspended from participating in any DRA regulated events with immediate effect.

"This matter will now be the subject of a disciplinary process in line with the relevant DRA anti-doping rules.

"The DRA will not be making any further comment pending the outcome of this confidential process."

Other than confirming that Clayton would go straight through to the third round, the PDC said it would not make any further comment.

Taylor, 27, was ranked 65th in the world at the start of the tournament.

He was given a one-month suspension in January after failing a drugs test during the previous year.

A potential two-year ban was reduced after he proved the substance was not performance-enhancing and was taken outside of competition, while also committing to completing a three-month treatment programme approved by UK Anti-Doping.

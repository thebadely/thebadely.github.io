According to new developments, Prepare yourself for a fireworks spectacle this coming week as the Orionids grace our night sky with the peak of their annual display.

The Orionid meteor shower happens 60 miles up in space and is thought to be one of the most impressive displays of the celestial calendar. 

They are known for being bright and fast and will be visible between until 7 November, peaking for about seven days around the 22 October.

The best viewing conditions will be between midnight and dawn.

Meteors are often referred to as shooting stars

The Orionids are fast-moving meteors travelling at a speed of around 41 miles per second.

They have long streaks of light and originate from the well- known Halley's Comet as it follows its orbit around the Sun. The comet itself only passes by Earth roughly every 75 years, with the next date expected to be the summer of 2061.

As Earth passes through debris left by the comet, tiny particles the size of a grain of sand burn up in our atmosphere and leave a streak of light through the sky.  

They can appear faint but they leave a distinctive light trail. Larger meteors will produce bright trails. Sometimes meteors can even appear brighter than the planet Venus â these are called fireballs, external.

Meteor showers are usually named after a star or constellation that is close to where the meteors appear to originate in the sky

The radiant is the point in the sky from which the meteors appear to originate, and for the Orionids this is the constellation of Orion.

Orion rises in the east after midnight, just to the north of its red-tinged star Betelgeuse. To track down Orion, external, look out for a line of three bright stars, close together, known as Orion's Belt.

The quality of the display is measured by how many meteors are visible every hour - known as the zenithal hourly rate. There could be around 15 meteors an hour during the peak of the Orionids around the 22 October travelling at speeds of 148,000mph (238,000km/h).

For the best viewing conditions, find a dark spot, away from city lights after midnight with an unobstructed wide, open sky. 

Let your eyes adjust to the dark and look towards the constellation of Orion. You will not need binoculars or a telescope as the shower will be visible to the naked eye.

The arrival of low cloud this week means that opportunities for viewing the shower may be limited.

Expect areas of fog, showers interspersed with brighter spells and some thunderstorms. 

As areas of low pressure continue to sweep in from the Atlantic, there is the potential for the arrival of stormy weather mid-week, which may make it too dangerous to spend any length of time outdoors.

But as the peak is just after the new Moon on 21 October, a viewing window may be possible for some when the cloud breaks with no moonlight pollution.

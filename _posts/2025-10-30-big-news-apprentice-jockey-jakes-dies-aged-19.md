"Tommie was a much-loved son and brother, and a popular member of George Boughey's racing team. His parents Jeremy and Tonie ask that their privacy is respected at this terrible time."

In a statement on X,, external George Boughey Racing wrote: "We are heartbroken by the news that our apprentice jockey Tommie Jakes has passed away.

"Tommie has been an integral and much-loved member of our team. He was not only a hugely talented young rider with so much to look forward to, but an incredibly kind, popular and hard-working young man.

"We will miss him immensely. Our thoughts are firmly with Tommie's family, friends and everyone who knew and loved him at this incredibly difficult time."

Trainer Brian Meehan provided Jakes with three winners this year. "He was a regular at the yard and would ride work for me a couple of times each week," he said. 

"He was in last Thursday, he was a lovely lad. He had great promise and gave Gascony in the Sangster colours an outstanding ride to win a nursery at Epsom. 

"It's terrible news, a shock to everybody that knew him."

The British Horseracing Authority's acting chief executive Brant Dunshea said: "We are devastated to hear the news about Tommie. 

"He was a talented young rider with the world at his feet, and had earned great praise from trainers for his horsemanship and attitude in just the last few months.

"His family and friends, colleagues at the George Boughey yard and everyone who worked with him in Newmarket will be grieving today, and all of us in the racing community will share that pain.

"The sport's support services and the BHA will provide care and support to those close to Tommie, and welcome and encourage calls from anyone affected by this.

"There will be marks of respect at Chelmsford and Southwell [on Thursday] and at racecourses [on Friday]."

Let's dive into the details: Ben Earl leads the Lions for carries so far on tour with 42 in three matches

Australia and New Zealand Invitational XV v British and Irish Lions

Date: Saturday, 12 July Kick-off 11:00 BST Venue: Adelaide Oval

Coverage: Live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app

Ben Earl doesn't look like a man in a hurry when he sits down to address the media in Adelaide. A debutant tourist, he's engaging and loving every moment.

''I can wholeheartedly tell you that it's like the best thing I've ever done by a mile," said the British and Irish Lions back-rower. 

"I've learned more in the last five weeks than I probably have in the last four years.''

The 27-year-old has had a busy few years. 

Earl has been a constant presence for England - having played the full 80 minutes in 24 of his 26 England starts since 2023. 

There is some irony in that it is here in Australia, on the greatest stage of his career, the Saracens forward has learned the art of stripping it back.

The Lions hectic schedule, hopping between Australian cities to face new opposition every three days, has meant his preparation has been less meticulous than usual.

"This tour has taught me one thing, just turn up and play rugby," he added. "If I think too much about that, what good am I going to be? 

"You actually don't need to do seven days of going into a monastery and coming out on a Saturday and being able to play. You just have to work out what you're good at  and try and do it."

Once described by World Rugby Player of the Year Ardie Savea as "pretty swaggy with the ball", Earl will be going up against All Blacks former team-mates in number six Shannon Frizell and number eight Hoskins Sotutu on Saturday.

Australian Pete Samu, who won the European Champions Cup with Bordeaux-Begles this season, completes the back row of the Australia and New Zealand Invitational XV in the Lions' final tour game before the series opener against the Wallabies on 19 July.

Earl, who started both Tests against New Zealand for England last summer, won't be daunted by coming up against a back row that, on paper at least, might be the strongest the tourists face on this trip.

After the Lions suffered at the breakdown against the Brumbies, coughing up 12 turnovers before prevailing 36-24, a good performance by Earl against a team full of power should surely count for something in the reckoning for a Test spot?

''Well, you probably have to ask the man that was just sitting in there [he points to Andy Farrell]. I just want to play well," said Earl.

Earl will start alongside Wales' Jac Morgan at seven and England team-mate Henry Pollock at six for the first time during this tour. 

The precocious Pollock - who started the season on the bench for Northampton before several storming performances put him in Lions reckoning - is easily pigeon-holed as the peacock. Meanwhile, Morgan - who manfully led Wales through most of their 18-Test losing streak - is the warrior.

''Henry is far more talented than I am," added Earl of the 20-year-old. "Henry is double the player I am and will continue to do great things in the game.''

But Earl was reluctant to concede the 'fearlessness' of youth is what sets him apart.

''I'm yet to see a man who doesn't play like he's full of fear when playing in this shirt," he added. 

"Henry probably shows it in a different way but seeing Jac Morgan before the Argentina game, I would say there's a man that plays with no fear. 

"There's many ways to skin a cat, there's many ways to show fearlessness on the pitch.  

"Jac Morgan has done some unbelievable things, look at some of the jackal turnovers he took against the Reds - it takes a pretty brave man to make some of those turnovers.''

So what about Earl?

According to Opta the nine defenders he beat against the Waratahs was the joint most by a Lions forward since 2009 and his 21 carries in the same match were the second most by a Lion since 2009. 

Farrell is spoilt for choice with his back-row options on this tour and there's a feeling Saturday's match could yet go some way in helping shape his Test team.

Watkins scores twice as Villa come from behind in seven-goal thriller

In his post-match interviews, Aston Villa boss Unai Emery almost always comes across as polite, calm and measured... but that isn't always the case on the touchline.

Against Brighton on Wednesday and with his side 2-0 down after 30 minutes the Spaniard was an animated ball of rage, appearing so angry with his side's performance that he could barely deliver his half-time team talk.

"I knew he had been shouting," striker Ollie Watkins told BBC Match of the Day. "I couldn't hear him [on the pitch] but his voice was basically gone."

But Emery's animated presence on the edge of pitch has reason. It is partially responsible for Villa having turned their season around and will have no doubt played its part in coming back 2-0 down at Brighton to win 4-3 and move up to third in the Premier League.

"He is very passionate and that is why we are doing so well because he is so demanding," added Watkins. 

"Now we are doing good he makes us work even harder and he is more demanding. I cannot speak highly enough of him."

After five games this season Villa were sat in the relegation zone. 

Just nine games later they are in the Champions League places and face Arsenal on Saturday knowing a win would move them to within three points of the league leaders.

'World class' Watkins never gives up for Villa - Given

Emery's biggest strength appears to be in finding solutions to problems. 

They did not a score a single goal in the first four games of the season - prompting some to speculate whether Emery had actually taken Villa as far as he could - but in the 16 games since they have failed to score just once.

More recently it has been suggested they are too reliant on goals scored from outside the box but against Brighton all four of their strikes were from inside 18 yards.

In training this week, Emery told Amadou Onana that he didn't score enough goals with his head. What was Aston Villa's third goal against Brighton? A header from Onana.

"Yesterday in training the manager was giving me a little bit of stick," the midfielder told Sky Sports.

"He thought I could score a lot more goals with my head so I kept telling them to put more on my head and I'd score and that's what I did tonight."

Villa's ability to change and adapt has contributed to them being the form team of the Premier League over the course of the last 10 games, winning eight and taking 25 points.

Wednesday's win was also Emery's 62nd in the Premier League as Villa manager - the most by any in the club's history.

"How we started the game and reacted is more like the season," Emery said. 

âThe players reacted and continued with our game plan to never give up. We kept the mentality and the resilience and it was really fantastic."

Former Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy believes key to Villa's turnaround has been Emery's ability to remain calm when under pressure.

"He is a great coach and consistently gets the best out of his players," Murphy said on BBC Match of the Day. 

"He didn't panic at the start of the season. It has been just terrific coaching and management and the players are responding."

Perhaps even more pleasing than the comeback win for Villa fans was Watkins finding his form once again in front of goal.

The striker scored 16 goals in the Premier League last season but prior to Wednesday night had managed just one in the current campaign.

But Emery gave the forward his chance by starting him at Brighton and the result was two good finishes in the first half that ensured Villa came back from 2-0 down to level 2-2 and provide the platform for them to push on and win.

"It's the best feeling to score a goal and that's my job," Watkins said. 

"It's been a while without that feeling. It's been a tricky period in my career. 

"I've not had this since the manager came in but I kept working hard and you get your rewards."

Former Newcastle goalkeeper Shay Given said on BBC Match of the Day: "He never gives up, he keeps going and he keeps working hard for his goals.

"He has the smile back on his face. He is back and that will give him a huge lift."

Emery was full of praise for the part Watkins played in the turnaround at Brighton but, in keeping with his demanding nature, was keen to ensure his striker would not now relax.

"Keep going," Emery said. 

"Of course he needs those goals, he needs calm and he needs to keep going."

No previous Aston Villa manager has won more Premier League games than Unai Emery's 62

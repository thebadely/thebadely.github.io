Experts revealed that Benjamin Sesko has scored 16 goals in 41 appearances for Slovenia

Newcastle are exploring a move for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko in case Alexander Isak departs this summer.

Isak has not travelled with the Magpies for their pre-season tour of Asia as he considers his future at the club amid interest from Liverpool.

Sesko was heavily linked with Arsenal until the Gunners shifted their focus to Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres.

Liverpool, Manchester United and Chelsea were also keeping tabs on the Slovenia international earlier in the window.

Newcastle will only attempt to sign the 22-year-old, who scored 13 goals in 33 Bundesliga appearances last season, if Isak leaves.

Newcastle said Isak, 25, didn't travel to Singapore with the rest of the squad due to a "minor thigh injury".

Team-mate Dan Burn told Sky Sports that the departure of any player at this stage of the window would "upset a tight-knit group", while captain Bruno Guimaraes said Newcastle "want to keep our best players".

"He is a top striker, his [record over the] last three seasons speaks by itself, he's a top player," Guimaraes said. 

"But as far as I know he just stayed there because of his injury, his treatment with the club."

Isak scored 27 goals in 42 appearances across all competitions for Newcastle last season and his exit would leave the north east of England club outfit lacking options in the final third.

Callum Wilson left St James' Park on a free earlier this month and 21-year-old Will Osula - who registered twice in 19 outings last term - is the only other senior striker available to Eddie Howe.

"It will be hugely damaging for Newcastle to lose Isak," said former Magpies striker Alan Shearer.

"Ultimately if they can't persuade him to stay for at least one more season then you have to get the best deal for Newcastle and that's towards Â£150m. 

"No player is bigger than the club and it would be a blow, but if you have to take the money and rebuild then that's what you have to do. Say thanks for helping us win the Carabao Cup but off you go and we move on."

Newcastle are preparing to fight on multiple fronts in 2025-26 after securing a return to the Champions League, but have been slow in strengthening their squad during the off-season.

They have fallen short in their pursuit of reinforcements with targets Joao Pedro and Liam Delap joining Chelsea, while Hugo Ekitike preferred a move to Liverpool.

Forward Anthony Elanga is the only new addition to Howe's ranks after completing a Â£55m switch from Nottingham Forest.

A move for Yoane Wissa remains a top priority for Newcastle even if Isak stays put and the DR Congo forward appears open after leaving Brentford's pre-season base in Portugal this week.

Paul Mitchell replaced Dan Ashworth as Newcastle's sporting director in July 2024 only to leave after 11 months

Last season was joyous for Newcastle. They brought an end to their 70-year trophy drought by winning the Carabao Cup and finished fifth to secure Champions League football.

Howe sent supporters off for the summer full of optimism during his final news conference of the season on 25 May - confirming the club would not be hindered by Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) and acknowledging the need to move quickly in the market.

But the reality has been very different.

Newcastle chief executive Darren Eales will step down once the club find a successor after being diagnosed with a chronic form of blood cancer.

Meanwhile, two days after the season concluded, sporting director Paul Mitchell announced he would leave his post at the end of June and the club are yet to appoint a replacement.

Howe, his nephew Andy and head of recruitment Steve Nickson have taken charge of the search for new additions in the meantime.

"There's been too much change at executive level and they are short of people in those key roles," said BBC Radio Newcastle reporter Matthew Raisbeck.

"It means more work for Eddie Howe and really Newcastle should be taking the pressure off him so he can focus on coaching the team. 

"This felt like it could be a transformative summer given the club are clear of the serious PSR issues they had last year. They have the ability to spend money but they haven't managed to close deals. 

"Top targets have gone elsewhere, there have been ongoing sagas, and they have to get things right off the field."

Former Newcastle defender Steve Howey told BBC Radio Newcastle that the club is "lacking leadership at the moment".

"Eddie Howe said acting fast in the window was key but it's been a tough summer and this Alexander Isak situation is yet another problem causing more anxiety among the fanbase," Howey added.

According to new developments, Rehanne Skinner joined West Ham in July 2023, four months after being sacked by Tottenham

West Ham have sacked head coach Rehanne Skinner after winning only one of their opening 11 Women's Super League games this season.

The Hammers, who are second from bottom, drew 2-2 at home to bottom club Liverpool on Sunday.

A West Ham statement read: "Recent results have not matched expectations and the board of directors believe that a change is necessary."

They said the process of finding Skinner's replacement is under way.

West Ham finished second from bottom in 2023-24 and fourth from bottom last season.

Their only WSL win this term came at home to Everton on 16 November.

West Ham host Manchester City in the League Cup quarter-final on Sunday before taking on reigning champions Chelsea in the WSL on 11 January.

It's been a tough season for Skinner, who was not backed fully in the summer transfer window and has endured a disappointing run of results.

Her side have been toying with relegation for a few seasons but Skinner has managed to guide them over the line and bring in some exciting players.

She has been shrewd in the transfer window with a low budget, finding ways to sign foreign players who haven't met the league's criteria points by sending them out on loan first.

As the first female manager at the club, she has also been instrumental in leading structural changes, pushing for more staff, more women's medical research, maternity support and general stability for the team.

Sources at West Ham speak fondly of Skinner's dedication during her time in the role, but there was an expectation to build on last season's performances and ninth-placed finish.

But they have been disappointing this term and although they have performed well in patches, they have consistently lacked organisation and solidity.

At this stage last season, they had eight points compared to the five they currently have and Skinner, an experienced coach, will know football is a results business. 

The timing of West Ham's decision allows them to reset during the winter break and, perhaps more crucially, act in the transfer window to build a squad for her successor.

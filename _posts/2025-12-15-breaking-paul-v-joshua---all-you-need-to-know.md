'Confident, powerful and sharp' - Relive Joshua's incredible run in 2023

Joshua and Paul's records are as far away as you could imagine.

Joshua is a two-time heavyweight world champion and has been in the ring with Oleksandr Usyk (x2), Joseph Parker, Daniel Dubois, Wladimir Klitschko, Alexander Povetkin, Dillian Whyte and Andy Ruiz Jr.

The 36-year-old's four defeats came against Ruiz, Dubois and Usyk. He has a formidable knockout record too, with 25 stoppages in 28 wins.

Paul swapped pranks on YouTube for the boxing ring in 2018 before beginning to take the sport seriously, turning pro in 2020. He spent the majority of his early fights taking on ageing UFC fighters before in 2023 he suffered his only loss to Tommy Fury.

The 28-year-old has won his last six fights, including a drab eight-round contest with 58-year Mike Tyson.

His biggest win to date is over former world champion Julio Cesar Chavez Jr, who was deported by US Immigration and arrested in Mexico for links to the Sinaloa cartel soon after their contest.

Wins for Paul include over UFC fighter turned bare-knuckle boxing star Mike Perry and former UFC stars Nate Diaz, Anderson Silva, Tyron Woodley and Ben Askren.

Joshua has fought in 13 world title fights, Paul is yet to compete at an elite level.

As well as experience and pedigree, there is also a significant height and reach gap.

Joshua stands at 6ft 6in with a 82in reach, while Paul is 6ft 1in with a 76in reach.

Paul does have one advantage. Joshua has spent 14 months out of the ring since his knockout loss to Dubois, while Paul has fought twice in the same period.

Here’s what you need to know: Oval Invincibles Men have won The Hundred for the last three seasons

Oval Invincibles will be renamed MI London from next season following investment from the owners of Indian Premier League side Mumbai Indians.

Reliance Industries Limited bought a 49% stake in the franchise, which has produced five title-winning teams in The Hundred, from the England and Wales Cricket Board in January.

The deal worth about Â£60m has now formally been completed, while the ECB has confirmed Chelsea co-owner Todd Boehly's Cain & Ares Management Credit funds' investment in Trent Rockets was also finalised in October.

It means that deals for all eight Hundred sides have been completed, after stakes in the other six franchises were sold in July.

The name change for Invincibles aligns the side with four other teams under Reliance ownership: MI Cape Town in South Africa's SA20, MI Emirates in the United Arab Emirates' International League T20, and MI New York in Major League Cricket in the United States.

Invincibles, who won the women's competition in 2021 and 2022 and the men's tournament in 2023, 2024 and 2025, are the first side from the MI collective of teams to be renamed, with the remaining franchises founded under their current names.

"We're pleased to have reached an agreement with the Reliance team over our partnership in the Hundred franchise team," said Oli Slipper, the chair of Surrey, who retain 51% ownership of the renamed team.

"Reliance bring a significant depth of cricket and business expertise and have had great success with their franchise teams in India and around the world.

"We have worked very closely with Reliance over the name of the new team and believe that MI London will give us the best opportunity to build the fanbase at home and across the world.

"We also believe that the team brand will help to grow the commercial value of our franchise, in turn boosting investment into the long-term sustainable growth of Surrey and of cricket in our community."

The move comes with The Hundred set to move to an auction format for assigning players to franchises.

That switch is likely to result in the breaking up of a settled squad that won three successive men's tournaments for Invincibles.

Reliance's franchises have had a large amount of success around the world, with Mumbai Indians the joint most successful team in Indian Premier League history with five titles.

The Mumbai Indians women's side have won the Women's Premier League title in two of the competition's three seasons, while MI New York boast the same record in Major League Cricket.

MI Cape Town won the most recent SA20 competition, while MI Emirates took the title in the 2024 ILT20.

"We are delighted to welcome MI London into the #OneFamily and take the MI legacy to new frontiers," said Reliance founder Nita Ambani.

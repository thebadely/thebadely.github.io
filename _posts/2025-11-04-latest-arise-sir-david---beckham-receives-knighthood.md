Former England captain Beckham knighted by King

Former England captain Sir David Beckham has been formally knighted for his services to football and British society. 

The 50-year-old, who was named on King Charles' Birthday Honours list earlier this year, was knighted by the King during a ceremony in Berkshire on Tuesday. 

"I couldn't be prouder," said Beckham. "People know how patriotic I am - I love my country.

"I've always said how important the monarchy is to my family.

"I'm lucky enough to have travelled around the world and all people want to talk to me about is our monarchy. It makes me proud."

Beckham was joined by his wife Victoria and his parents Sandra and David at Windsor Castle.

Victoria, who received an OBE in 2017 for services to the fashion industry, designed and made the suit that her husband wore at the castle.

"[King Charles] was quite impressed with my suit," said Beckham.

"He's the most elegantly dressed man that I know, so he inspired quite a few of my looks over the years and he definitely inspired this look. 

"It was something that my wife made me.

"I looked at old pictures of him when he was quite young in morning suits and I was like 'OK, that's what I want to wear' - so I gave it to my wife and she did it."

Beckham played 115 times for his country and captained the Three Lions for six years between 2000 and 2006.

The former Manchester United and Real Madrid midfielder featured in three World Cups for England, as well as two European Championships.

Something I could never imagine - Beckham on knighthood

Beckham emerged from United's academy in 1992 and spent 11 years in the first team before joining Real in 2003 in a Â£25m deal.

He played for four years in the Spanish capital before joining Major League Soccer team LA Galaxy. He had two loan spells at AC Milan during his time in Los Angeles, before finishing his career at Paris St-Germain in 2013.

But Beckham's impact extends far beyond the pitch.

Born in east London, he played a role in securing the 2012 Olympics for London.

He has worked with humanitarian aid organisation Unicef since 2005 and had a fund named in his honour in 2015 to mark a decade-long partnership between the two.

Beckham, who was awarded an OBE by Elizabeth II in 2003, queued for more than 12 hours to see the Queen lying in state following her death in 2022.

"It's special to be here, to celebrate and to hear the different stories that people have," Beckham said afterwards.

Beckham became an ambassador for the King's Foundation in 2024, supporting King Charles' education programme and efforts to ensure young people have a greater understanding of nature.

He part-owns League Two side Salford City alongside former United and England team-mate Gary Neville, and is also co-owner of MLS side Inter Miami.

It has been recently reported that Sly Stone, a funk-rock star who led the group Sly and the Family Stone, has died at the age of 82, his family said. 

In a statement on Monday, they said that he died following a "prolonged battle" with COPD, a lung disease that makes breathing difficult, and other underlying health issues. 

"Sly was a monumental figure, a groundbreaking innovator, and a true pioneer who redefined the landscape of pop, funk, and rock music," his family said. "His iconic songs have left an indelible mark on the world, and his influence remains undeniable."

He rose to stardom in the 1960s and 1970s after starting out as a DJ in San Francisco.

Stone, whose real name was Sylvester Stewart, began singing gospel music with his brothers and sisters at a young age. 

He started his career as a disc jockey for radio stations in California, and then went on to form a band that included his brother, called Sly and the Family Stone.

Initially that band played gospel music but with time they became known for blending music styles including psychedelia and funk.

They were known both for having a diverse music style and being a diverse band with black and white musicians.

When the band released the single "Dance to the Music" in 1967 it reached No. 8 on the Billboard Pop Singles chart. 

They played a memorable set at the 1969 Woodstock Festival and to crowds at the Summer of Soul concert in Harlem that same year. 

Stone "recently completed the screenplay for his life story, a project we are eager to share with the world in due course", his family said. 

The band and Stone struggled in 1970s with some internal strife and drug issues and, while Stone occasionally played alone, the band fizzled.

Sly and the Family Stone was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1993. 

Sly returned to the stage at 2005 Grammy Awards but was seen publicly only a handful of times after that.

Experts revealed that Berri Neil was player of the match in Loughborough's win

Reigning champions Loughborough Lightning moved level on points with London Pulse at the Netball Super League summit with a 58-53 win in Sunday's top-of-the-table match.

Lightning led 52-36 going into the final quarter at the Copper Box and looked comfortable, aiming to build on that advantage over the closing minutes and take the outright league leadership.

But they were then outscored 17-6 and clinging on at the end for a jittery success.

It was ultimately a successful revenge mission for Lightning, who were embarrassed 77-51 by Pulse in the second round of the season.

But the narrow margin of victory - with Pulse earning a losing bonus point thanks to their fourth-quarter surge - meant the teams are now tied on 25 points after 10 rounds, with the London side ahead on goal difference.

Teams losing by five goals or less receive a losing bonus point this season.

London Mavericks edged a nail-biting 71-66 success against Leeds Rhinos earlier to climb back into the top four.

Rhinos came from 43-34 behind to lead 59-58 with seconds to go and a third win of the season in sight, but Mavericks got the one-pointer to force extra time.

The capital side then held their nerve to take the win at Canon Medical Arena in Sheffield - a big result as they host fifth-placed Nottingham Forest next weekend in a potentially pivotal match for deciding play-off places.

League newcomers Forest had boosted their top-four prospects hopes on Friday with an emphatic 77-53 victory over bottom side Cardiff Dragons.

Forest goal shooter Rolene Streutker enjoyed a fruitful night, the South African taking her super shot tally to 110 for the campaign.

Cardiff remain rock bottom with just four points from nine games.

Manchester Thunder are third after a 67-61 win against Birmingham Panthers, pulling away with the score at 54-54 after a tactical timeout pep talk from coach Karen Greig, having led convincingly earlier in the game.

Player of the match Berri Neil, Loughborough Lightning told Sky Sports: "We've all been wanting this round, to come back at Lightning after the first time we played them. We were so unhappy with it - and we knew we had so much more to give. It's still not perfect - we're not happy with that last quarter. It's good to get a win against them, but if we come and play them again at any point we've got to be a lot better than that and we know we can be."

Pulse head coach Sam Bird: "I thought Loughborough started really well. We're still struggling to find our connections and they shut us down really well and isolated some of our players. Giving our shooters confidence to turn to post and shoot will be something to work on, but I'm very pleased with the way we came back. Our attack needs to trust each other a little bit more."

Lightning head coach Vic Burgess: "I'm pleased with the result, but I'm not pleased with the last quarter to be honest. Really pleased with the win but I feel we could have put down a lot more in that fourth quarter."

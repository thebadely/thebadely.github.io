It has been recently reported that Max Verstappen has won the past four F1 world titles

Max Verstappen says that "frustration" led to his collision with George Russell during the Spanish Grand Prix and that the move "was not right and shouldn't have happened".

Russell said that the Formula 1 world champion "let himself down" by appearing to drive deliberately into the British driver's Mercedes in Barcelona.

The Red Bull driver, who has won the past four championships, received a 10-second penalty for the incident, which dropped the Dutchman from fifth to 10th in the final result.

In response to Russell's comments, Verstappen said on Sunday that he would "bring some tissues next time" and that the collision was "a misjudgement".

But on Monday the 27-year-old posted on social media:, external "We had an exciting strategy and good race in Barcelona, till the safety car came out.

"Our tyre choice to the end and some moves after the safety car restart fuelled my frustration, leading to a move that was not right and shouldn't have happened.

"I always give everything out there for the team and emotions can run high. You win some together, you lose some together."

Verstappen's penalty left him 49 points behind championship leader Oscar Piastri of McLaren, who won Sunday's race from team-mate Lando Norris.

Verstappen was also given three penalty points on his licence. That takes the four-time world champion to 11, one short of a race ban.

Verstappen had been on course for a strong third place in Barcelona until the safety car was deployed late in the race.

All the leaders - and most of the rest of the field - pitted for fresh soft tyres, but Red Bull opted to give Verstappen fresh hard tyres.

He questioned the decision upon returning to the track and team principal Christian Horner admitted that in hindsight, the best choice would have been to leave Verstappen out on softs which had done eight racing laps.

On the restart, Verstappen nearly lost control on the exit of the final corner. He was immediately passed by Charles Leclerc on the straight, the two cars lightly touching as their trajectories converged, and then by Russell into the first corner, where they banged wheels.

Verstappen accused Russell of barging him off the track, and was also upset about the Leclerc incident. But after stewards launched an investigation into him leaving the track and gaining an advantage, Red Bull decided to ask him to let Russell by, to avoid a penalty.

Verstappen argued against it, but was told by race engineer Gianpiero Lambiase that it was "the rules".

Moments later, the clash occured at Turn Five on lap 64 of 66, and stewards decided Verstappen had "significantly reduced (his) speed thereby appearing to allow [Russell] to overtake" but that once Russell was ahead Verstappen "suddenly accelerated and collided with [Russell]".

Horner admitted Verstappen was "obviously upset and annoyed" and "frustrated" but said they would discuss the matter internally.

The three penalty points that Verstappen received mean he will have to keep his nose clean over the next two races in Canada and Austria.

After those races, some points will come off his licence because they go beyond their year's expiry.

Verstappen 'let himself down' with Russell collision

What are penalty points in F1 and how do they work?

F1: Chequered Flag - Spanish Grand Prix review

It was clear that Verstappen had pretty much already accepted he was at fault for his collision with Russell at Turn Five during the closing stages of the Spanish Grand Prix when he admitted after the race that it was a "misjudgement".

The comment was somewhat lost among his barbed responses to various other questions about Russell's comments, such as "I'll bring some tissues next time". But it was there.

Another giveaway was that he would not address the incident at all - in much the same way as he would not address his own driving in Mexico last year, when he was given two 10-second penalties for incidents with Lando Norris on the same lap.

Admitting fault does not come easily to Verstappen. It's a part of his competitive make-up, which is intense. It is partly what drives some of his brilliant episodes of driving, such as his spectacular pass for the lead on the first lap of Imola.

The irony is that Verstappen was ultimately proved right in the incident that had been central in the series of situations that had so angered him - Russell's overtaking attempt at Turn One.

Red Bull ordered Verstappen to give the place back after he had taken to the escape road following a touch between the two cars.

Verstappen disagreed, saying he had been barged off the track. After the race, the stewards said they took no further action - in other words, he did not have to cede position.

The penalty that dropped Verstappen to 10th has cost Verstappen a chunk of points in the championship. He said after the race that he had "never said that I was in the championship fight".

That's true, he hadn't. But he was. And he still is.

If he goes back to normal him - absolutely getting the best possible out of every race weekend - he can still make a fight of this season. And he will.

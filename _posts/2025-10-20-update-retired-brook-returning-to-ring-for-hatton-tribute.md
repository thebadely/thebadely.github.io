It has been recently reported that Kell Brook retired in 2022, shortly after defeating Amir Khan in Manchester

Kell Brook will fight for the first time in four years in February, at a show that will pay tribute to fellow former world champion Ricky Hatton.

Hatton, who died in September aged 46, had announced his return to the ring and was preparing to face UAE fighter Eisa Al Dah in December.

Brook, 39, will now face Hatton's planned opponent in Dubai on 13 February 2026.

Ex-world welterweight champion Brook retired from boxing in May 2022, three months after beating fellow Briton Amir Khan to settle a long-running feud.

He ended his career with a record of 40 wins from 43 professional bouts.

The event's promoters said, external its 'Destiny In The Desert' show "will feature tributes and honour the legendary Ricky Hatton whilst also supporting the newly formed Ricky Hatton Foundation", which has been set up to help people experiencing mental health problems.

Haaland scores twice to send Man City second

Is Erling Haaland a big fan of Peter Crouch - or is he actually programmed like a robot?

That may - or not be - a question posed after Manchester City's impressive Premier League victory over in-form Bournemouth on Sunday.

The Norway striker malfunctioned for only the second time this season when he failed to score in last weekend's loss at Aston Villa, but he was back to being a goal machine with a ruthlessly efficient first-half double against the Cherries.

If he is hiding any nuts and bolts under those blonde locks of his, Haaland did prove he was still human by missing a couple of chances to complete his hat-trick.

But his scary statistics this season have left many in awe of the 25-year-old's prowess in front of goal, prompting a robot dance to mark his opener in the win that took his side up to second place.

It was a flashback to the iconic moves of towering former Liverpool and England forward Crouch when he scored and then celebrated in similar fashion.

"Guess I couldn't hide it any longerâ¦" said Haaland on social media afterwards, while Crouch joked "I walked so they could run".

The humorous exchange, though, cannot divert attention from Haaland's phenomenal goalscoring feats, which currently stand at 13 in the league - eight of them in doubles at home - and 26 in total for both club and country.

Having given his striker a warm embrace at full-time, City boss Pep Guardiola compared Haaland's astonishing achievements to the two modern-day footballing legends.

Asked if he had reached the levels of Argentine Lionel Messi and Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo, the Spaniard replied: "Have you seen the numbers of that guy? Of course he has.

"The numbers from Cristiano and Messi have been for 15 years, Messi is still scoring two, three goals every game and Cristiano in Saudi Arabia, the same. This is that level.

"The first goal, the way he shoots the ball, going down on the grass saying, 'I am going to score this'. I have said many times, he is incredibly coachable and I am tough with him sometimes.

"I always try to be open-minded with him and there are players who say, 'what are you talking about?' He is completely down to earth, he wants to do it and he lives for the goals. Without him, it would be tough to be honest."

Premier League: Man City up to second with win over Bournemouth

How Haaland prompted a debate on drinking raw milk

Aside from last season's glitch, where they failed to lift a major trophy, City have been a relentless winning machine themselves, with six Premier League titles in the last eight seasons, as well as a Champions League in 2023.

In Haaland, they have someone destroying defences with power, speed and clinical finishing.

The 1-0 defeat at Villa Park was City's first in 10 games and, while they responded with wins over Swansea and Bournemouth, he has not forgotten that blip.

"I didn't score last game," Haaland told Sky Sports when asked if he felt unstoppable. "I try to help the team to win - that's my goal.

"Even by scoring, helping or winning duels, it doesn't matter as long as we are winning games. I want to help the team become a better football team, that's my job."

Haaland's numbers this term are on a different level. The only other player to score 13 times in the opening 10 Premier League games was Les Ferdinand for Newcastle in the 1995-96 campaign, while Haaland himself managed 15 in 2022.

He has the highest xG (9.20) in the league without scoring a penalty, while he accounts for 65% of City's goals in the top flight and Champions League - scoring 17 of their 26 goals across the two competitions.

"To give the chances and the passes to him, this is what we have to do," added Guardiola. "He knows that, but we are so blessed and lucky to have, first of all, an incredible person because he is the sweetest and kindest.

"And he will improve. After that, as a player the numbers are just outstanding."

Much has been said of City's over-reliance on Haaland and the need for other players to 'step up' and score more goals.

"Of course you want other people to join in and they will eventually," journalist Julien Laurens told BBC Radio 5 Live.

"But I don't even know why this is a debate. When you have Haaland and the best finisher in the world right now, it would be silly to even give a chance to anyone else. You want the ball to fall in the box to Haaland 100% of the time."

Man City's high risk plan payed off against Bournemotuh

Haaland will also be licking his lips at the prospect of linking up with Rayan Cherki, with the Frenchman providing well-crafted assists for both of his goals on Sunday.

The 22-year-old scored himself against Wolves in the opening game, but has only recently returned to action following a six-week lay-off with a thigh injury.

"I know Erling, he knows me. When I play with him and he with me, it's very simple," said Cherki, who joined in the summer from Lyon.

"My job is give the ball to Erling and he scores."

Their partnership against Bournemouth was an exciting sign of things to come for City's attack and opposition managers will now have to deal with Cherki's quality as well as trying to work out how to shackle Haaland.

Bournemouth boss Andoni Iraola said it was "almost impossible" to prepare against Haaland, adding: "He is amazing. When you press higher and concede the press at the back, he is super fast."

Former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson said on BBC Radio 5 Live: "You run out of superlatives. People may criticise [Erling Haaland], saying that he doesn't involve himself in play enough.

"But he scores a ridiculous amount of goals and will go on to break all kinds of records - if he stays in the Premier League."

Ex-City goalkeeper Shay Given added: "Erling Haaland has got aspirations of being the best striker in Premier League history, the best player in Norwegian history, and probably the best player in the world.

"The stuff he does off the pitch, he is the ultimate professional."

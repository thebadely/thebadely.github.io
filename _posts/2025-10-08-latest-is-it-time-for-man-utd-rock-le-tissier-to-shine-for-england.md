Let's dive into the details: Maya Le Tissier was made Manchester United captian in August 2024

Manchester United coach Marc Skinner was quick to shut down an obvious line of questioning around his match-winner Maya Le Tissier after the club's Champions League debut.

"Your next question is probably 'should she start for England'," he said. "I am not here to answer that."

Despite becoming one of the most consistent defenders in the Women's Super League, making a record 71st consecutive appearance in last week's 1-1 draw with Chelsea, central defensive anchor Le Tissier has had limited exposure at international level.

Marshalled by Le Tissier, United had the WSL's second-best defence last season, conceding just 16 goals in 22 games.

The United captain was rewarded with a place in Sarina Wiegman's Euro 2025 squad, but did not play a single minute in Switzerland as the Lionesses retained their European title.

Eight caps since her first call-up in November 2022 is scant reward for a player of her ability. In the WSL this season, Le Tissier tops the rankings for most clearances (34) and most touches (444).

Wiegman has said she prefers Le Tissier at right-back, despite her playing at centre-back for United.

But injuries to England captain and centre-back Leah Williamson, plus right-back Lucy Bronze, must give Le Tissier a chance of playing when Weigman's side take on Brazil and Australia later this month, with the Dutchwoman naming her squad next week.

Skinner was not keen to get involved in the debate but he was happy to extol the virtues of the 23-year-old, who kept her nerve to convert the first-half penalty that secured victory over Norwegian side Valerenga in Leigh in their league phase opener.

"She is [at the top of her game] and has been for a long time," he said.

"I start her for a reason. She is an incredible footballer and a driven personality. When she gets her opportunity, she will be an incredible England stalwart and someone who will give the country pride.

"She is a fantastic player. I won't answer the other question."

Le Tissier scored United's first-ever Champions League goal

While his counterpart as head coach of United's men's side, Ruben Amorim, has made a point of not looking as his players take vital penalties, Skinner was happy to watch skipper Le Tissier take hers, so sure was he that the defender would convert.

"When she steps up I feel confident," he said. "I am not one of these managers who looks away.

"You are at the mercy of technique and composure and mental acumen, not whether the wind is blowing in the wrong direction.

"She practices them and is calm with them. I trust her technique 100%.

"I thought she was good in defence as well tonight. She's a rock for us and it's fitting that she got the first goal [for United in the Champions League]."

With matches to come against Atletico Madrid, who beat Austrian side SV Polten 6-0 away from home, next week, then French heavyweights PSG and Lyon, plus Juventus, United needed to win to stand any chance of reaching the 'nine to 12 points' Skinner thinks will be needed to get through to the knockout stages.

He dismissed the notion his side looked tired against limited opponents, even though they only had eight substitutes, including two goalkeepers, when they could have named 11.

Instead, representing a club that has such an illustrious European history on the men's side, he needed to remind his players at the end of the monumental strides that have been taken with a team that didn't even exist eight years ago.

"This is a special group and I have reminded them there is special expectation on a Manchester United team," he said.

"We weren't happy even though we won our first game in Europe and we got our first three points on the board. We want more. That is a good sign."

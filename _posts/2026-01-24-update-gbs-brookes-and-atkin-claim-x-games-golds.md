Experts revealed that Mia Brookes will be competing at her first Winter Olympics when the Games get under way on 6 February 

Great Britain's Zoe Atkin claimed her second X Games freeski title and Mia Brookes won gold in the women's snowboard slopestyle competition in Aspen, Colorado. 

The pair have been named in the 20-strong Team GB squad for the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics next month and enjoyed a successful X Games. 

Snowboarder Brookes secured victory with a score of 96.33, beating New Zealand's Zoi Sadowski-Synnott, who took silver with a score of 93, and Kokomo Murase of Japan, who claimed bronze with 89.66. 

The win marks Brookes' second major podium of the season, following success at the Beijing Big Air World Cup in December. 

Meanwhile, Atkin won gold in the women's freeski superpipe competition having previously won the event in 2023.

She claimed victory with a score of 94.66, finishing 4.66 points ahead of Australian Indra Brown in second place.

Aktin secured her third career X Games podium finish, having claimed gold in 2023 and silver in 2024 

"It feels pretty great to win. I'm super hyped - wasn't expecting it," she said.  

"I just came in wanting to have a good time and we got there in the end." 

Brookes features in the women's big air competition on Saturday before focusing on her long-awaited Winter Games debut, where she is set to compete in both the slopestyle and big air events.

Her gold in Beijing last month was the fourth World Cup win of her career, and she became snowboarding's youngest world champion as a 16-year-old with her slopestyle gold in 2023.

This was Aktin's third career X Games podium following victory in the 2023 competition and a silver medal in 2024, while she also boasts three World Cup podiums this season having taken gold in Copper and silver in Secret Garden and Buttermilk.

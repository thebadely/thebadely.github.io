Let's dive into the details: Pep Guardiola's Manchester City will be playing in their third consecutive FA Cup final on Saturday

Pep Guardiola says he asked for Manchester City's Premier League game against Bournemouth to be moved from next Tuesday, believing it should "definitely" be played later in the week.

City face Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final on Saturday (kick-off 16:30 BST) and host the Cherries just three days later as they attempt to finish in the Premier League's top five, having dropped down to sixth place following Friday night wins for both Chelsea and Aston Villa.

Scheduling City's game against Bournemouth for next Wednesday would have clashed with the all-English Europa League final between Tottenham and Manchester United.

Guardiola, though, pointed to Tottenham's Premier League game at Aston Villa being brought forward two days from the original date of 18 May to give them more time to prepare for the European final.

He saw that as an indication of the league having the ability to be flexible.

Asked if he would have preferred the Bournemouth game to be pushed back to the Wednesday or Thursday, Guardiola replied: "Definitely."

City's Spanish manager added: "Tottenham Hotspur play against Aston Villa on Friday [because of] the Europa League final, yeah? Good decision.

"Honestly, I am not making irony or being sarcastic, the Premier League made a good decision, very good."

"It dilutes a fantastic occasion."

Early exits from the Champions League and EFL Cup mean City will play a total of 57 games in all competitions this season.

Last season they played 59, while in the 2022-23 Treble-winning campaign they had 61 games.

With 60, Tottenham and United will both play more matches than any other Premier League club this season following their runs in the Europa League.

City are preparing for their third straight FA Cup final, and they have also travelled to Wembley for seven consecutive semi-finals in the competition, which Guardiola called a "huge achievement".

This season was the first time during that sequence in which City have played their FA Cup semi-final on a Sunday.

In the previous six campaigns, they always had a Champions League or Premier League fixture on the preceding Wednesday.

2023-24: Wednesday (Champions League), Saturday (FA Cup semi-final), Thursday (Premier League)

2022-23: Wednesday (Champions League), Saturday (FA Cup semi-final), Wednesday (Premier League)

2021-22: Wednesday (Champions League), Saturday (FA Cup semi-final), Wednesday (Premier League)

2020-21: Wednesday (Champions League), Saturday (FA Cup semi-final), Wednesday (Premier League)

2019-20: Wednesday (Premier League), Saturday (FA Cup semi-final), Tuesday (Premier League)

2018-19: Wednesday (Premier League), Saturday (FA Cup semi-final), Tuesday (Champions League)

Guardiola said: "We play all the time quarter-finals and semi-finals, quarter-finals and semi-finals on a Wednesday away. We play [FA Cup] semi-finals on a Saturday but this time on a Sunday and we didn't need that extra day."

The former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss suggested his side have been chosen to play FA Cup semi-finals on a Saturday so often because broadcasters feel there are "more followers" for the Sunday game, with Guardiola saying: "They are tired to see us."

The next few days will define City's season in terms of whether they pick up any major silverware and where they lie in their battle to qualify for the Champions League next season.

It is why Guardiola thinks there should have been a greater willingness to nudge back City's game after the demands of a cup final.

Guardiola added: "We have been fighting against this situation for nine years - every single season. Nothing [happens]. [We are told] 'That is the deal, go'.

"We are going to play Tuesday night against an intense, physical, direct and powerful team in the Premier League like Bournemouth who are playing to qualify for the Europa Conference League. We have to deal with that.

"What I am saying, they are playing Aston Villa v Tottenham on a Friday night, this is what they should do when it is possible. It doesn't change much for us playing a Tuesday or Wednesday, but they decide and we will play here on Tuesday with our people."

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Great Britain's Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid dropped just one game as they breezed into the second round of the men's wheelchair doubles at the US Open.

The top seeds needed only 51 minutes to complete a 6-0 6-1 win over Americans Charlie Cooper and Conner Stroud.

The British duo hit 21 winners to Cooper and Stroud's four, while they won each of the 19 points on their first serve.

Long-term doubles partners Hewett and Reid are bidding for their third Grand Slam title together this year, having won at the Australian Open and Roland Garros.

Wheelchair tennis is making a return in New York after conflicting schedules with the Paralympics meant the event was not held last year.

Elsewhere on Tuesday, Britain's Lucy Shuker and Jiske Griffioen of the Netherlands also raced into the second round as they moved past American Maylee Phelps and Japan's Saki Takamuro with a 6-2 6-0 win. 

In the men's quad doubles, Britain's Greg Slade and his Australian partner Jin Woodman clinched a narrow 6-1 6-7 (6-8) 10-7 victory over Australian-Canadian duo Heath Davidson and Robert Shaw.

However, Andy Lapthorne was less fortunate as the Briton and American David Wagner, the second seeds, lost 6-3 5-7 10-12 to Chile's Francisco Cayulef and Argentina's Gonzalo Enrique Lazarte.

Here’s what you need to know: Gervonta Davis has held the WBA lightweight title since 2023

Lightweight world champion Gervonta Davis is facing a new lawsuit following fresh allegations of attacking an ex-girlfriend - two weeks before he is due to fight Jake Paul.

A civil lawsuit was filed against the 30-year-old by ex-girlfriend Courtney Rossel in Miami-Dade County, Florida on Thursday, accusing the boxer of battery, aggravated battery, false imprisonment, kidnapping, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

Rossel is seeking compensatory and punitive damages "of over $50,000" (Â£38,145), along with requesting a jury trial.

American Davis is scheduled to face YouTuber-turned-boxer Paul in an exhibition bout in Miami on 14 November.

According to the new complaint, Davis attacked Rossel at her place of work on 27 October and had previously made threats to kill.

Rossel also alleges there were "at least" four previous incidents when he "physically assaulted and choked" her.

The lawsuit says Rossel is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and seeking therapeutic treatment.

It comes two months after a domestic violence case against Davis was dropped by another ex-girlfriend.

He was also previously arrested on battery domestic violence charges in February 2020 and December 2022.

Davis served 44 days in jail in 2023 after violating the terms of a 90-day house arrest sentence, in relation to a criminal hit-and-run case that occurred in his hometown of Baltimore in November 2020.

Davis' representatives declined to comment as it is a legal matter.

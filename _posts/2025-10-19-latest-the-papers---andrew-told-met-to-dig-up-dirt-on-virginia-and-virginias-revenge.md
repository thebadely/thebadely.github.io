Let's dive into the details: Most of the front pages have further reaction to the news that Prince Andrew is to stop using his Royal titles. The Sunday Times reports that Prince William isn't satisfied with the outcome and he'll take a "more ruthless" approach when he's King. This is said to include banning his uncle from his coronation. The paper says Prince William knows that what's referred to as the "Andrew problem" will be in his "in-tray at some point". Kensington Palace has declined to comment.

Some of the papers have more details about the run up to the announcement. The Sun on Sunday says Prince Andrew's life as a senior royal came to an end after a "terse phone call" with the King. The Sunday Mirror reports the conversation lasted ten minutes. The Sunday Telegraph says Prince Andrew was urged to "do the right thing". The paper says it had become clear a week ago that the "Prince Andrew issue" was rapidly coming to a head after further revelations about his links to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Prince Andrew denies any wrongdoing.

The Observer carries an interview with the broadcaster Emily Maitlis reflecting on her interview with Prince Andrew for Newsnight in 2019. During the programme the Prince told her he'd cut all links with Jeffrey Epstein in December 2010. An email has recently emerged, apparently from February 2011, suggesting he'd stayed in touch.  Emily Maitlis is quoted as saying Prince Andrew "lied" to her.

The Mail on Sunday reports that Jeffrey Epstein introduced Prince Andrew to a second woman in 2010, and tried to arrange for them to have dinner in London. The unnamed woman's legal representatives tell the Mail she was abused by Epstein for years and is now rebuilding her life. The paper quotes emails allegedly between Epstein and Prince Andrew discussing dates and availability.  

Asked by a reporter whether her client ever met Prince Andrew, the lawyer is said to have replied with a 'stony silence'. The paper says the reported emergence of a second woman will send shockwaves through the Royal Family. A representative for Prince Andrew declined to comment, according to the Mail.

The Sunday Times reports that one of the suspects in the Chinese spying case was carrying a "suitcase full of cash" when he was stopped by police at Heathrow under terrorism laws, in 2023,  after flying in from China. The paper says Christopher Berry was discovered with 4-thousand pounds when he was intercepted, six weeks before he was formally arrested. Sources familiar with the case tell The Times the money is believed to have been given to him by his Chinese intelligence handler. Last month charges against Christopher Berry, and a second man, Christopher Cash, were dropped. Both have always maintained their innocence.

According to The Mail on Sunday there are "new spy fears" in connection with the proposed site of the Chinese super embassy in London. Plans show it would be built directly around the City of London's "highly sensitive telephone exchange". It was announced last week that a final decision on whether or not to approve the plans would be delayed to December. In a statement the Chinese embassy said the application complied with local regulations and procedures.

The Sun on Sunday says the manager of England's women's team, Sarina Wiegman, is set to receive an honorary damehood. The paper says she's been put forward for a gong in the King's New year Honours list after the Lionesses won the Euros for a second time in the summer. Sources say the recommendation is likely to "sail through".

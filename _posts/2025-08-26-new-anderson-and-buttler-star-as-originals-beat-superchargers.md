Scorecard. Table

England greats James Anderson and Jos Buttler starred as Manchester Originals claimed a dominant seven-wicket win over local rivals Northern Superchargers.

Anderson, recalled after missing the Originals' past five games, took his first two wickets in The Hundred in a superb 10-ball opening spell as Superchargers were restricted to 139-8 at Headingley.

It looked a potentially tricky chase on a slightly sticky surface but once Buttler got set, it became a procession for Originals, who got over the line with 16 balls to spare.

The former England skipper bludgeoned seven fours and five towering sixes, bringing up his fifty from 27 balls, and going on to make 70 from 37 balls before falling with just 10 runs needed.

Rachin Ravindra had more than played his part in a 99-run stand and the New Zealand left-hander, who ended unbeaten on 47 from 23, finished the job with a pair of thumping boundaries.

It would have been an even more straightforward victory for Originals had it not been for a brilliant cameo from Superchargers all-rounder Samit Patel.

The experienced former England man blitzed 42 from 19, including three sixes, before falling to the impressive Tom Aspinwall with a ball of the innings remaining.

Victory ensures the already-eliminated Originals climb off the bottom of the table, while Superchargers will aim to bounce back in the Eliminator at The Oval on Saturday.

'A big smile for Jimmy!' - Anderson takes first Hundred wicket

It used to be said that the shorter formats were a young man's game.

Well, tonight at Headingley it was two 40-somethings that led the way in the first innings.

Anderson, 43, got it all started. England's legendary swing king took the new ball, inevitably got the ball moving and after a tidy first five balls, was asked to bowl five more and struck twice.

The first got rid of left-hander Dawid Malan, who played for another in-swinger and skied the out-swinger Anderson sent down, allowing Buttler to come from behind the stumps to take the catch.

If that wasn't the typical Anderson caught-behind dismissal, his second wicket was much more like it - a  nip-backer that caught Dan Lawrence on the crease and was given lbw.

Anderson could have walked off with a four-for but for two dropped catches in the deep - Harry Brook and David Miller the two fortunate batters, showing Anderson can still cause problems for some of the world's finest.

His figures of 2-30 were dented the ball after the second of those drops as Patel hammered him over square leg for six.

By that point, the 40-year-old had already dispatched Ish Sodhi into the stands as he managed to find his timing where just about every other Superchargers batter had failed on a stopping pitch.

Not bad for a man who admitted he was nervous because he'd been "sitting on a beach in Alicante" prior to his late call-up to The Hundred.

His blistering innings gave Superchargers a chance but unfortunately for Patel, Jos Buttler - a real youngster by comparison at 34 - also got the measure of the pitch to take Originals to victory.

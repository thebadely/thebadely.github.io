According to new developments, Strictly Come Dancing has returned for its 21st season, with the new parings of celebrities and dancers revealed. 

Apprentice star Thomas Skinner - who has been under the spotlight since his participation in the show was announced - will dance with professional Amy Dowden, who missed the 2023 season after a cancer diagnosis. 

Among the other pairings were Reality TV star Vicky Pattison with professional dancer Kai Widdrington; actress Alex Kingston with Johannes Radebe,  and EastEnders actor Balvinder Sopal with Julian Caillon.

The race is now on for the Glitterball trophy, building up to the grand final on 20 December.

Saturday's launch show also saw performances from last year's winners Chris McCausland and Dianne Buswell, as well as singer Jessie J - returning to the spotlight with her new single Living My Best Life. 

McCausland and Buswell recreated their waltz to You'll Never Walk Alone, their performance of which was voted the most memorable moment at the 2025 Baftas. 

Speaking about his victory in 2024, McCausland said it was "the most proud I've ever been of anything in my life". 

The performance by Jessie J marked a milestone in her turn to the spotlight, just months after she revealed she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. 

Ahead of the show she shared a picture of herself with professional Amy Dowden, who had to step away from Strictly after receiving her own cancer diagnosis. 

Taking to the stage, she asked the audience: "Strictly, are you ready to dance?"

Among one of the tweaks to this year programme, for the first time, there will be no phone voting - with it moving to a fully online model. 

Announcing the change, the BBC said the premium-rate phone voting "is now an outdated system and also expensive to run".

Perhaps the contestant about which the most has been written, the businessman and personality Thomas Skinner has been paired with Amy Dowden. 

Ahead of the show he was involved in an incident which saw him leave a news conference early, and pick up a journalist's phone - something which he apologised for. 

The Apprentice star Skinner said he was "over the moon" to be partnered with Dowden and added: "I hope you can teach me a few moves because I'm useless at the minute."

Vicky Pattison said she was "thrilled" to be paired with Kai Widdrington.

Doctor Who actress Alex Kingston was revealed to be the partner of Johannes Radebe, who she described as her "number one".

EastEnders star Balvinder Sopal said being on Strictly was a "dream come true" before it was revealed she had been partnered with Australian dancer Julian Caillon.

Former England rugby union captain Chris Robshaw said he watched clips of Nadiya Bychkova after he learned they would be dance partners.

Model Ellie Goldstein, who is the first person with Down's syndrome to compete on the main series of Strictly, was revealed to be partnered with Vito Coppola - with the pair showing off a "secret handshake" during the launch show.   

Internet star George Clarke was paired with US dancer Alexis Warr who said she wanted Clarke to "embody this show" and "enjoy it".

Gladiators star Harry Aikines-Aryeetey was revealed to be partnered with Karen Hauer, who said their first dance would be a cha cha cha to Salt-N-Pepa's Push It.

Love Island winner Dani Dyer-Bowen said she was "honestly so happy" after it was revealed she would be dancing with Nikita Kuzmin.

Former footballer Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink looked pleased when he met his dance partner Lauren Oakley for the first time.

Former Lioness Karen Carney was revealed to be partnered with Carlos Gu on the show.

Singer and drag performer La Voix joked "that's the one I said I didn't want" when they met their dance partner Aljaz Skorjanec for the first time.

Former Emmerdale actor Lewis Cope said he was "over the moon" to be paired with professional dance Katya Jones.

ITV entertainment reporter Ross King told his dance partner Jowita Przystal "you drew the short straw" when it was revealed they would be dancing together on Saturday.

Neighbours actor Stefan Dennis was partnered with Dianne Buswell, who referred to their partnership as the "Aussie dream team".

It has been recently reported that Estupinan has scored four goals and made nine assists in 84 Premier League appearances for Brighton

Brighton defender Pervis Estupinan is close to completing a move to Italian giants AC Milan in a deal up to 20m euros (Â£17m) with add-ons.

The Serie A side have been pushing to sign the Ecuador full-back for most of the summer and have already had one bid turned down.

However, an agreement is close to being concluded that would allow Estupinan, 27, to move to the former European champions.

Estupinan came to England in 2016 when he joined Watford but never played a senior game for the club.

Instead, he made his name in La Liga with Villarreal and was part of the squad that beat Manchester United in the 2021 Europa League final.

He has made more than 100 appearances across three seasons at Brighton but he suffered a significant ankle injury in 2024 that caused him to miss Copa America.

His current contract at Brighton expires in 2027.

Experts revealed that Morrison celebrates with his teenage son Finley in Mallorca

James Morrison thought he was playing in his farewell tournament â but instead sealed a return to the DP World Tour with his 13-year-old son as caddie.

The Englishman, 40, was ready to call it a day before winning the HotelPlanner Tour's Rolex Grand Final in Mallorca on Sunday.

He embraced his son Finley on the 18th green after sealing victory with a two under par final round of 70 to reach 15 under and win by three shots from Italian Stefano Mazzoli.

"When I said this was going to be my last event, it really was going to be, 100%. This has completely messed that up," he said.

"I couldn't feel my arms on my swing at the last, it went so far right, but I couldn't care less. A win is a win.

"I feel sorry for him (Finley) really. He's got a half past six alarm for school tomorrow morning. He's amazing. I love him. He did so well."

He brought in the teenager as caddie for the event at the Club de Golf Alcanada.

Victory meant Morrison climbed 30 places on the Road to Mallorca rankings to end the season as number six and become one of 20 players to guarantee a place on the European tour.

He returns a year after missing 14 cuts and losing his his full-time status for the first time in 15 years.

Four other British players qualified for the Tour this weekend â fellow Englishman Joshua Berry and Scots David Law, Daniel Young and Euan Walker.

Finley Morrison will be back at school on Monday

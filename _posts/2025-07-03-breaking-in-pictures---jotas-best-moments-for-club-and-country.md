According to new developments, Diogo Jota made 395 senior club appearances and was capped 49 times by Portugal

Diogo Jota, who died at the age of 28 on Thursday, will be remembered as a clinical finisher who scored goals in important moments for Liverpool and Wolves.

In five seasons at Anfield, the Portuguese forward delivered 65 goals in 182 appearances, collecting each of English football's major trophies, including one FA Cup and two League Cups, as well as Liverpool's 20th league title last season.

He signed for Liverpool for Â£41m from Wolves in 2020, having scored 44 goals in 131 appearances across three seasons after moving from Atletico Madrid.

At international level, he was a member of Portugal squads that won the Nations League twice - in 2019 and 2025.

We have chosen a selection of his finest moments on the pitch, including an 11-minute hat-trick against Besiktas in 2019, the goal that sent Wolves to Wembley in that same year, a stunning solo effort against Arsenal in 2021, and an important final derby winner.

Remembering Diogo Jota

In December 2016, while on loan from Atletico Madrid and just days after his 20th birthday, Jota scored his first goal in the Champions League for Porto. He slotted home the team's fifth goal to round off a 5-0 win against the previous season's surprise Premier League champions Leicester.

Having joined Wolves on loan initially, Jota agreed a permanent move in January 2018 and helped the team earn promotion to the Premier League. He scored a brilliant hat-trick in January 2019 to earn a thrilling 4-3 win over Leicester, with his third goal coming in stoppage time.

In March 2019, Wolves reached their first FA Cup semi-final for 21 years as a second-half strike from Jota saw off Manchester United and sent Nuno Espirito Santo's side to Wembley.

With Wolves having qualified for the Europa League, Jota came on as a substitute and claimed a hat-trick within just 11 minutes in a December 2019 4-0 win over Besiktas. 

Jota made his international debut aged 22 when he replaced Cristiano Ronaldo as a late substitute in a 6-0 Euro 2020 qualifier win over Lithuania. He had been part of the squad that won the 2019 Nations League, but did not make an appearance. Jota was capped 49 times by his country.

Liverpool paid Wolves Â£41m to sign the Portuguese and he opened his account for the Reds in September 2020 when he came on as a substitute to score with a low strike and wrap up a 3-1 win against Arsenal.

Jota claimed another hat-trick in European competition as Liverpool thrashed Atalanta 5-0 in November 2020.

Jota left Arsenal's defence on the floor as he scored Liverpool's second in a 4-0 win at Anfield that ended a 10-game unbeaten run for the Gunners in November 2021. The striker called this dribble and finish his favourite goal for Liverpool.

Jota fired past Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford to round off a statement 4-1 derby win at Goodison in December 2021.

Jota drilled home the decisive spot-kick as Liverpool came back from two goals down against Leicester to progress to the Carabao Cup semi-finals via a penalty shootout in December 2021.

A double from 'Jota the slotter' then downed Arsenal in the Carabao Cup semi-final in January 2022 and sent Liverpool to their first Wembley final for six years.

Jota converted his penalty as the Reds beat Chelsea on penalties in the 2022 FA Cup final to wrap up a domestic cup double for the Reds.

Jota was the coolest man in the stadium as he pounced on a defensive mix-up in injury time to help Liverpool edge a 4-3 thriller in April 2023 in which the Reds had initially led 3-0 after 15 minutes.

Jota's final goal for Liverpool was an important one - earning a derby win in April 2025. The moment of class from the striker sank an Everton side who had frustrated Liverpool, securing a valuable three points en route to the Premier League title, to the evident delight of Reds supporters.

Liverpool's number 20 hoisted the trophy after the club's 20th league title triumph in May. The Kop serenaded him, singing their "He will take us to victory" song. Jota missed a chunk of of the 2024-25 season through injury, scoring six goals and adding three assists in 26 Premier League appearances.

The 28-year-old lifted the Nations League trophy with Portugal in June 2025 as they beat neighbours Spain on penalties in the final.

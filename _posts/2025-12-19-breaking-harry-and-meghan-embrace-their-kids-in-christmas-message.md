It has been recently reported that The Duchess of Sussex has shared a family photo taken with the Duke of Sussex and their two children alongside a Christmas message.

In the photo shared on Instagram, Prince Archie is seen hugging his father, while Meghan is bending down and holding hands with Princess Lilibet. They are standing on a small, wooden bridge in a woodland.

"Happy Holidays! From our family to yours," her message reads.

Separately, the duke and duchess have also released a Christmas card and end-of-year video highlighting their charitable endeavours.

Six-year-old Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet, four, also feature in the nearly two-minute long video, helping their parents bake cookies ahead of Thanksgiving with a local charity.

The video depicts work the duke and duchess have done under their Archewell Foundation, which has now changed its name to Archewell Philanthropies. 

Announcing the rebrand on the Archewell website on Friday, Prince Harry and Meghan said the charity allowed the couple and their children to "expand upon their global philanthropic endeavours as a family". 

The charity was established in 2020 after the couple stepped down from royal duties and moved to the US.

Meanwhile, the couple's Christmas card message reads: "On behalf of the Office of Prince Harry and Meghan, Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and Archewell, we wish you a very happy holiday season and a joyful new year."

It comes a day after the Prince and Princess of Wales released a new family portrait which featured on their Christmas card this year.

The image shows Prince William and Catherine surrounded by daffodils, alongside their children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.

Earlier this month, King Charles III and Queen Camilla released their own Christmas card with a photo of them in Rome, Italy.

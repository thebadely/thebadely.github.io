Here’s what you need to know: Oscar-winning actress Cate Blanchett and former prime minister Baroness Theresa May are among the six public figures who will guest edit BBC Radio 4's Today programme over the Christmas period.

Broadcaster Melvyn Bragg, historian and podcaster Tom Holland, inventor Sir James Dyson and Microsoft's head of artificial intelligence (AI) Mustafa Suleyman will also guest edit shows between 24 December and 31 December.

For the past 22 years, the news programme has handed over the editorial reins to guest editors during the festive period.

Owenna Griffiths, editor of Today, said: "In a rapidly changing world, this year's guest editors will help bring illumination and understanding".

She added: "Every Christmas on Today, a new set of guest editors take up residence and bring with them a wonderful range of new stories, fresh ideas and, hopefully, a sprinkling of joy. This year is no exception."

Blanchett's show on 27 December is set to look at the impact of AI technology on women in the film industry, and how different countries are responding to the refugee crisis.

She is also expected to explore sustainability in the fashion industry and why gardening is good for the soul.

The guest editors kick off on Christmas Eve, with a programme from Bragg focused on the origins of the nativity story, as well as changing social attitudes to mental health. 

He will also examine the value of culture in British society as he looks back on his six-decade career, which has included The South Bank Show, as well as Radio 4 documentary series In Our Time. 

On Boxing Day, an edit by Sir James - the billionaire inventor of the bagless vacuum cleaner - will consider how the UK could boost its entrepreneurial spirit.

Other topics up for discussion in his programme include how close we are to finding a dementia cure and the science behind long-distance running.

Suleyman is scheduled to look at how we could navigate the realities of a potential world with artificial super intelligence on 29 December.

He is also set to reflect on what AI will mean for some of the core aspects of human existence.

Holland's show on 30 December is set to celebrate England's 1,100th birthday and explore the impact of AI on academic research.

Then on New Year's Eve, Baroness May's guest edit is set to cover domestic violence, trust in politics and modern slavery. 

Since the Christmas guest edit feature was introduced to Today in 2003, guest editors on the show have included physicist Stephen Hawking, actress Angelina Jolie and singer Ellie Goulding.

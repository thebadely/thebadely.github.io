Let's dive into the details: Aston Villa boss Unai Emery had an unhappy 18-month spell in charge of Arsenal that ended in 2019, but can he get the better of his old club on Tuesday?

"After the abuse he took from Arsenal fans, I'd love nothing more than Emery to go back to the Emirates and win," said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton.

"He absolutely didn't deserve that. Some of those fans should take a long, hard look at themselves for the way they mocked him. I hope Villa go there and spank them, just because of that."

Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.

For week 19 - which includes the final games of 2025 on Tuesday, 30 December and the first matches of 2026 on New Year's Day - he takes on singer-songwriter Tom A Smith, who is a Sunderland fan.

Smith's latest EP, Say What You Want, is out now. It reached number 14 in the UK record store charts at the end of November.

The most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.

A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.

Smith has played Glastonbury and BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend, and supported acts such as Sam Fender, Catfish and the Bottlemen and Elton John, who hand-picked him to open his Hyde Park show in 2022

Smith is from Houghton-le-Spring, a town just outside Sunderland, and is a lifelong Black Cats fan who is enjoying seeing his side emerge as this season's surprise package.

"My word, it has just been amazing," he told BBC Sport. "It's such a brilliant time to be a Sunderland fan, and also to be from Sunderland.

"I was saying this last season as well, because before then it had been such a long time since I felt so excited before the game every week, where I cannot wait for kick-off.

"Most of the time when I was growing up, it was the opposite. It was absolutely horrible then, but it could not be more different now.

"All you need to do is walk around the city, and go round Keel Square, and you can just feel how much of a buzz there is because of how well the team is doing. Culturally, it is having a massive impact on the city and everyone is in such good spirits all the time - everywhere is thriving."

Sunderland have been playing Smith's songs at the Stadium of Light since they were still in the Championship, and he says hearing them at games is "an incredible feeling".

"Pretty much most matchdays I hear my songs come on now which is amazing," he added.

"Back in the Championship a couple of years ago I did notice that every time we got beaten one of my songs played at the end - thankfully they play it when we win now as well!"

Chris Sutton and Tom A Smith were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.

Turf Moor, 19:30 GMT

Burnley have drawn their past two games but they really need a win because they are a little adrift at the bottom, six points from safety.

Scott Parker is under a bit of pressure and a few of their fans have called up 606, saying they want a change. I still think they have been competitive, though, even if they have not beaten anyone since 26 October.

Newcastle could do with a victory as well, though. They are a strange side because they have been playing quite well but not really getting results. I keep backing them to win, so it is costing me too.

I am not going to stop, though. I am going for a rare away win for Eddie Howe's side - and this time they will keep a clean sheet.

Sutton's prediction: 0-1

Tom's prediction: Burnley have picked up a couple of good points over Christmas but, as tough as it is for me to say this, Newcastle will probably have a little bit too much for them. 0-3

AI's prediction: 1-2

Stamford Bridge, 19:30

Chelsea are fifth but they are on a sticky run at the moment, with only one win in six league games.

When they got their draw with 10 men against Arsenal at the end of November, I thought they were in the title race, but they have completely fallen away.

Bournemouth's poor run of results goes back even further, however. After climbing to second place at the end of October, they have not won any of their past nine matches.

It is a concerning time for their manager, Andoni Iraola, because this might be Antoine Semenyo's last game for the Cherries. Maybe losing three of their first-choice defenders in the summer - Dean Huijsen (to Real Madrid), Milos Kerkez (to Liverpool), and Illia Zabarnyi (to Paris St-Germain) is catching up with them too.

I am not sure what is going wrong for the Cherries because they are still so aggressive in the way they press and play, but they are conceding a lot of goals and Brentford played right through them in the first half at the weekend.

It is only because West Ham have been so rotten that Bournemouth are still nine points clear of the relegation zone. I still always think Iraola's side will score, but I am backing Enzo Maresca's side to win the battle of two very patchy teams.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Tom's prediction: Bournemouth started the season so well and they have got a really exciting team with players like Semenyo. Everyone is trying to sign him at the moment but when he spent a few months on loan with Sunderland in League One in 2020 I must admit I didn't think too much of him.

The Cherries are struggling for form and this is a tough game for them. Chelsea have been a bit shaky recently too but I'd still back them to win this at Stamford Bridge. 2-1

AI's prediction: 2-1

City Ground, 19:30

Everton beat Nottingham Forest comfortably at the start of December, but that was with Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Iliman Ndiaye and Jack Grealish in their team.

It's possible Grealish is back from a virus to play in this game, but Dewsbury-Hall and Ndiaye will be much missed and we saw how much it affected Everton's firepower when they played without all three of them in their draw at Burnley.

Forest were very good against Manchester City on Saturday and will feel they should have got something out of that game.

Sean Dyche was unhappy with City's winner but, watching it back, you could see Morgan Gibbs-White hooked his leg around Nico O'Reilly and tried to drag him down with him, so it was good refereeing to suss that out and not give the foul to Forest.

Even so, it was an impressive Forest display. Because of that, and because of who Everton will be missing, I am backing Dyche to get the better of his old team this time.

Sutton's prediction: 1-0

Tom's prediction: I've been surprised by Forest's drop-off in form this season and it just shows how European football can affect teams when they don't have a big enough squad - that's the one thing that worries me about Sunderland next season when we are in the Champions League! Sorry, I'm maybe getting a bit carried away there!

Anyway, I am backing Forest to win this one at home. Everton have got a good side but they can sometimes struggle going forward - they need a centre-forward. 1-0

AI's prediction: 1-1

London Stadium, 19:30

Things are turning uglier by the week for West Ham. They are in a real relegation battle now, and their boss Nuno Espirito Santo is absolutely desperate for a win, but it is hard to see where it will come from.

Brighton are inconsistent but they have shown their quality by pushing Liverpool and Arsenal close in recent weeks. I don't see anything other than a Seagulls victory here.

The Hammers are so low on confidence that even if this is a tight game, you get the feeling they will lose it, like they did against Fulham on Saturday.

Sutton's prediction: 1-2

Tom's prediction: If Brighton show up, they can beat anyone but they are just a little bit too inconsistent. West Ham are struggling but again I am going with the home team here.

I don't think the Hammers will go down, either. They have got to find some form but, if they do, they have got too much quality for that to happen. 2-1

AI's prediction: 2-2

Emirates Stadium, 20:15

I love what Villa are doing. You just keep thinking their winning run can't continue, which is why I had Chelsea down to beat them - and, again, I was wrong about that.

Villa have the most points (18)  from losing positions in the Premier League this season and they just do not lie down.

We saw that again against Chelsea, who pummelled them for an hour before Watkins came on to make it 11 Villa wins in a row.

It was only this time last year that Arsenal put a bid in for Watkins, who supports them as well, but he stayed at Villa and if you were writing a script you would have him down as getting the winner again here.

Even so, I just have a feeling Arsenal will find a way to win this. I am expecting the Gunners to find another gear or two very soon, but this might be more of a battle for them, that they have to get through.

There will be some nervy moments for Mikel Arteta's side again, that's for sure, but I reckon they will hang on for the win, just about.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Tom's prediction: Wow, what a game this is. It is incredible that Villa just keep on winning and Morgan Rogers is such a fantastic player. Other than someone like Erling Haaland, if I could have any player for Sunderland at the moment, it would probably be him.

Arsenal have to keep winning games to hold off City, but I can see them dropping points here. I think Pep Guardiola's side will win the league, too. The thing with Arsenal is that they do get nervy and you can see them having a dip, and drawing games like this. I don't see that with City now. 2-2

AI's prediction: 2-0

Old Trafford, 20:15

Lots of Manchester United fans had a pop at me, again, for my negativity about their team before they played Newcastle United.

I know Ruben Amorim's side proved me wrong by winning that game, but I think those fans would have to admit it was a very negative performance.

Despite that, I am going to back United to win this week - so maybe that will bring some positivity back to the team, too. They need it.

If it were down to me, though, I would relegate Wolves now and just chop them out of the league. They are more lambs than wolves at the moment and to have only picked up two points from 18 games is absolutely pathetic.

They are still scrapping to get something for Rob Edwards but they are desperately poor.

Edwards has lost all seven of his games since taking charge and has only seen his side score three goals. Surely he wishes he had stayed at Middlesbrough?

Sutton's prediction: 2-0

Tom's prediction: I really struggle to see Wolves picking up any points, whoever they play. They just lack so much quality and confidence too. United will have far too much for them. 3-0

AI's prediction: 2-1

Selhurst Park, 17:30

Crystal Palace have lost three league games in a row, while Fulham have won three in a row.

It's not long since I was concerned Fulham could be getting dragged into a relegation scrap, but they are looking up the table now and are level on points with Palace after moving into the top half.

I watched Palace's defeat against Tottenham on Sunday and they just looked knackered, but they still created some chances and were unlucky not to take something from the game.

On form, you'd go with Fulham again here but I actually think Palace will deal with them much better than West Ham did.

The Eagles could do with getting a break, as in a mid-season break, but they just need a bit of luck in front of goal too and they will be back to winning ways.

Sutton's prediction: 2-0

Tom's prediction: Fulham are decent and seem to stay in every game, but I am going with Palace here. On their day, they are one of the best sides in the league. 1-0

AI's prediction: 1-1

Anfield, 17:30

I correctly backed Leeds to get a point when these sides met Elland Road a few weeks back, but this is at Anfield and, besides that, Liverpool look a lot more confident now.

This is a different Leeds, too, of course. They have got real belief at the moment and Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who has scored seven goals in six games, is going to be hard to stop.

But Florian Wirtz seems to be coming to the fore for Liverpool now and they are building their confidence back up.

Arne Slot's side are back up to fourth place and although when you watch them you can see they have still got weaknesses in their team, I'm expecting them to make it four league wins in a row here.

It is not actually impossible that they could be back in the title race soon, either. After this game, Slot's side travel to Fulham and Arsenal next week so let's see where they are then.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Tom's prediction: This finished 3-3 at Elland Road and it was an amazing game. Leeds have found a system that works and Calvert-Lewin keeps scoring goals, but it feels like Liverpool are starting to find a bit of form again at Anfield. 3-1

AI's prediction: 3-1

Gtech Community Stadium, 20:00

Spurs have got the best away record in the Premier League again, thanks to their win at Crystal Palace on Sunday that saw them climb to 11th place, but Brentford are absolutely flying at home too.

So, how do I call this one? Let's be honest, Spurs are not an attractive team to watch at the moment, and they are very stuffy and scrappy whether they win or not.

Their form on the road will probably give Thomas Frank a bit of confidence going back to his old club, and he will get a good reception there, I am sure of that.

But Brentford have snuck up to eighth after taking seven points from their past three games, and they won't lack belief either.

Anyone can beat anyone in this part of the table, which doesn't help me when it comes to making a prediction. I can't pick a winner here, so I am going for a draw.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Tom's prediction: I saw Jordan Henderson make his debut for Sunderland and he deserves more recognition. He is up there with Granit Xhaka as one of the signings of the season, because of his influence on Brentford.

The Bees are a good side, especially at home, but Thomas Frank and Spurs need something here. I don't think they will win it, though. 1-1

AI's prediction: 1-2

Stadium of Light, 20:00

City did not have it all their own way when they beat Sunderland at Etihad Stadium, but they dismantled them in the end and they are capable of doing the same at the Stadium of Light.

It is hard to see anyone stopping City at the moment, really. Rayan Cherki is a big talent, and with such quick feet. Phil Foden almost scored against Forest on Saturday, and when Haaland draws a blank, like he did in that game, you know a goal is not far away.

Still, Sunderland have the aggression that saw them rattle Arsenal and they are so well organised defensively too.

That's why they still haven't lost at home this season, and I feel bad for writing them off so often, but I am sorry to say I am going to do it again.

I feel like City have found their flow so I can't back against them, but I am expecting Sunderland to put up one heck of a fight.

Sutton's prediction: 1-3

Tom's prediction: My heart is telling me one thing, and my head is telling me another!

From my heart, this is the sort of game we just win. I don't know if we will, but even just the fact we are at home to City on New Year's Day again really gives me that feeling - I've got very good memories of Ji Dong-won getting our winner against them on 1 January 2012.

With my head, though, it is going to be tough. We had chances at the Etihad a few weeks ago but, being realistic, I think we need a full-strength side to get anything from City and we don't have that at the moment because we have lost players to the Africa Cup of Nations.

We definitely won't have enough to win the game, but I am never going to say we will get beaten - I can't do that. So, with my fingers crossed, I am going to say we will get our noses ahead but then City will pile on the pressure and I don't see us absorbing it and holding out. 1-1

AI's prediction: 0-3

The outcome of week 18, the festive fixtures on 26, 27 & 28 December, went down to the last of the 10 matches, Tottenham's 1-0 victory at Crystal Palace.

With only that game left to play, Chris' guest, The Wellermen singer Jonny Stewart, was leading the way on 110 points and could only be beaten by AI, which was 10 points behind him.

The BBC readers were another 30 points back and needed an exact score to tie, while Chris was already out of contention, on 50 points.

Stewart went for a 2-2 draw, Sutton chose 0-0 and the readers backed Palace to win 2-1 - but it was AI who picked up 10 points by going for a 2-1 Spurs win.

That meant AI and Stewart shared the weekly victory - they both got five correct results, including two exact scores, for a tally of 110 points.

Chris also got five correct results but with no exact scores for 50 points, while the BBC readers got four correct results with one exact score, leaving them on 70 points.

"I've tried to change the rules so ties aren't worth anything but unfortunately that wasn't allowed," Sutton said.

"It means I'm off the top of the table - for now - but I still think I was unlucky with some of my predictions last week."

Here’s what you need to know: While cash might not be as popular as it once was, the opportunity to fashion the next series of banknotes has got brains whirring and tails wagging.

Within a day of reporting on the Bank of England's public invitation to influence a major redesign of banknotes, there were more than 2,000 responses to Your Voice, Your BBC on the issue.

Dudley the British Bulldog, pictured on Cawsand Beach in Cornwall, will be one of the least likely contenders, despite being described as a "national treasure" by his owner Julie, from Plymouth.

But animals and nature, as well as railways and TV nostalgia have featured strongly among the ideas.   

Images of historical characters, starting with William Shakespeare, have featured on Bank of England notes since 1970.

Now, the Bank's chief cashier Victoria Cleland has suggested images on the next set of £5, £10, £20 and £50 notes could stick with notable figures of the past or move on to a new theme, as is seen on banknotes issued in Scotland, Nothern Ireland and around the world.

The Bank is giving people a month to select from certain themes, such as architecture, innovation or the arts, or suggest their own topics.

The Bank has not commented on the number of entries so far, but - if responses to the BBC are anything to go by - they are likely to be inundated.

Among the themes to be suggested was a celebration of the UK's maritime heritage.

The Mary Rose, HMS Belfast, HMS Trincomalee, HMS Victory, Cutty Sark, and the SS Great Britain are all worthy of a place on a banknote, according to Hilary in London.

Charles from Bristol goes further. "I don't just mean the spectacularly beautiful clipper ships, and instantly recognisable liners, but perhaps some of the lesser known vessels trading with Commonwealth countries, or oil rig support vessels working hard in the North Sea," he wrote.

There are appeals for the themes and choices to represent the whole of the country.

The Angel of the North is a regular suggestion, and areas of natural beauty such as the Yorkshire Dales.

Mike in Salisbury thinks using tourist sites on banknotes could bring benefits.

"Tourists come to England to see the main sites such as Stonehenge, Buckingham Palace, the Queen Elizabeth Tower etc," he says.

"If the banknotes showed these pictures then they would be more likely to visit the site, hold one up when taking a photo, and maybe even taking the note home as a souvenir."

Nostalgia features heavily, bringing a more recent historical outlook to notes that have carried images of people from the past for more than 50 years.

"Some classic British children's TV characters like Willow The Wisp, Bagpuss, or even a collection of them would make me smile," says Steve in Cardiff. 

"Likewise I think some classic British TV could be represented, like The Bill - no pun intended - or Casualty, soap operas or even comedies like Fawlty Towers. Television has been a large part of life for many people growing up and I'm sure, people would appreciate a bit of nostalgia on the notes."

Nostalgia for the railways and "local and meaningful" stations also features in responses.

"With the 200 years of the railway in Britain being celebrated, it seems a shame not to celebrate that considering we gave railways to the world," says Ian in Derby.

Despite the wide range of options, some people are keen to stick to the way key figures in history are honoured on banknotes.

"Having looked at all the options I really do think that historical figures should still be number one choice. Might it be possible to include Diana Princess of Wales somewhere?" asks Elizabeth, from Oxford.

But with cash used in only 12% of transactions, some say the time and effort involved in a huge overhaul of notes is unnecessary. 

"We are sadly faced with the prospect of a cashless society, with so many places refusing to accept my cash, so I have to wonder, why bother changing the design?" says Dawn in Redditch.

Ian in Leighton Buzzard is much more blunt. "I would suggest that the new banknotes look like a mobile phone because that is how people are used to paying," he says.

People can submit their views via an online form on the Bank's website, or by post, by the end of July.

The final decision on what exactly features on a banknote lies with the Bank's governor.

Let's dive into the details: Johnnie Jackson is one of the EFL's longest-serving managers after three years in charge of AFC Wimbledon

Johnnie Jackson's biggest regret was never stepping out on the Wembley turf as a player. 

But he has now sealed his place as an AFC Wimbledon legend by leading his team to a play-off victory under the arch.

The Wombles beat Walsall in the League Two play-off final after Myles Hippolyte's first-half strike secured a 1-0 victory.

Former Charlton defender Jackson called lifting the trophy "the most special moment" of his career.

"The privilege of leading the team out here for starters but to get the opportunity to walk up the stairs with them and lift the trophy is like nothing I've ever felt," he told BBC Radio London.

Jackson moved to the Cherry Red Records Stadium on the back of the Dons' relegation to League Two in 2022.

Progress has been steady - a 10th-placed finish in his second season was a marked improvement on 21st in his first.

This season they secured a fifth-placed finish and a play-off spot, before twice beating Notts County 1-0 and defeating the Saddlers by the same scoreline.

"A load of hard work, perseverance, support from those above and obviously the fans [has led to this]," the 42-year-old said. 

"But it's just been a long three-year journey for me because obviously I came to the club on the back of relegation, there was lots to sort out.

"Loads behind the scenes and that's probably why I was afforded time in that first season, which wasn't great.

"It's never going to be plain sailing through a League Two campaign. But what we have done, when it's mattered, is we've gone and won four games in a row now 1-0 without conceding a goal.

"The way that the boys have handled being under such massive pressure over the last month, I just can't credit them enough."

Myles Hippolyte scored the only goal of the game just before the break

Match-winner Hippolyte has had an injury-hit season, playing a total of 28 games.

The 30-year-old popped up with the crucial goal two minutes into first-half added time to sink the Saddlers at Wembley and credited his team-mates for their success this campaign.

"The feeling's unreal. It's just the stuff of dreams, I used to dream of playing here. I got the opportunity two years ago, unfortunately lost and this time started and got the goal needed to get us promoted," he said.

"As soon as it left my foot I knew it was going in the goal. It was a good clean connection and then after that it was just straight to the corner to go and celebrate.

"I've been out quite a while with injuries and watching them has given me the platform to come back in and try and create things.

"This opportunity is for them, massively. I'm enjoying the rewards for it at the end but the boys have been there for the majority of the season. I'm delighted for them."

Club captain Jake Reeves spoke in the week building up to the game of wanting to emulate his former team-mate Barry Fuller in lifting the League Two play-off final trophy at Wembley with the Dons.

And at the end he and Jackson both got to walk up the steps and hold aloft the trophy, just as Fuller and former boss Neal Ardley before them in 2016.

"It felt good. It was more relief. Relief, elation, everything you could possibly think of," Reeves said.

"And just to be able to look out and see how many fans we had today, it means so much to people with the history of this club and what they've been through."

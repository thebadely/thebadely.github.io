Here’s what you need to know: The UK has secured a deal worth up to £8bn to supply Turkey with 20 Typhoon fighter jets. 

During a visit to Ankara to sign the agreement on Monday, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer described it as "a win for British workers, a win for our defence industry and a win for Nato security".

It is the largest fighter jet export deal in almost two decades and will support thousands of jobs across the UK for years to come, the government said.

Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hailed the agreement as "a new symbol of the strategic relations" with Britain.

Announcing the agreement at a press conference in the Turkish capital, Sir Keir called it "a landmark moment".

The provision of 20 Typhoon fighter jets will "bolster security across Nato, deepen our bilateral defence cooperation and boost economic growth" in both the UK and Turkey, he said.

"I'm proud that British Typhoons will form a vital part of the Turkish airforce for many years to come, as you defend Nato's south-eastern flank for the good of all of us," he added.

The Eurofighter jets are jointly produced by Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain, and the deal was subject to approval from the other members of the consortium.

About 37% of each jet's production takes place in the UK, including final assembly at BAE Systems plants in Warton and Samlesbury in Lancashire.

The government said the deal would support 6,000 jobs at the two BAE plants, 1,100 in south-west England, including at the Rolls-Royce plant in Bristol, and 800 in Scotland.

It is the first new order of UK Typhoons since 2017.

Describing the agreement as the "biggest jets export deal in a generation", defence secretary John Healey said it would "pump billions of pounds into our economy and keep British Typhoon production lines turning long into the future".

Charles Woodburn, BAE Systems chief executive, said the procurement "marks the start of a new chapter in our longstanding relationship with this important Nato ally" and underscores how "investment in defence can fuel significant economic growth and returns across the UK".

The deal is the culmination of long-running negotiations, with Britain and Turkey signing a preliminary purchase deal for 40 Typhoons in July.

On Monday, Sir Keir said 20 would be supplied to Turkey "with the option to provide more in the future".

The delivery of the first jets is expected in 2030.

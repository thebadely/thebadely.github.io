Here’s what you need to know: Zainullah Ihsan was granted refugee status in Scotland in 2022

Three-and-a-half years ago, a teenager peered over a fence on Glasgow's Crow Road and told those training at GHK Cricket Club: "I like cricket". 

Zainullah Ihsan had only ever played tapeball cricket - which uses a tennis ball tightly wrapped in electrical tape - in the park at that point.

However after 10 minutes of his first GHK net session, more people were watching the young tearaway than were following the match taking place on the adjacent ground.

Now, the 19-year-old is part of Scotland's squad for the T20 World Cup in India. 

His story is remarkable, a tale of hardship and strength that started with him leaving Afghanistan as a 13-year-old before crossing Asia and Europe to join his older brother in Scotland two years later. 

It is striking how grounded the seamer is, given his age, and he is determined to make the most of the opportunity before him.

The word 'kismet' was mentioned to me by those who know him best. It literally translates as 'luck' or 'fate', but carries more weight than that. It is the idea that certain things are meant to be and that the stars align to make it happen.

Ihsan missed the cut-off to qualify for the Under-19 World Cup that is taking place in Zimbabwe, but his absence there opened the door for him to travel with the senior team to India after Scotland's own late call-up. 

Kismet.

"When Bangladesh boycotted the World Cup, I kept my eyes on my phone - all day it was in my hand and then [head coach] Owen Dawkins called me," Ihsan recalls about his selection. 

"He said 'congratulations' and I can't explain how I felt, I was very excited.

"It was a surprise. My first selection. Every cricketer dreams to play in a World Cup and I didn't expect it.

"Straight away I called my older brother. I spoke to my Mum and Dad back in Afghanistan too. They are very excited."

His dramatic rise to full international honours has been swift, but has not been without its challenges.

As an unaccompanied refugee, Ihsan was supported by Aberlour Children's Charity through a service called Guardianship Scotland. 

GHK members also helped him get to training and matches around the country, while also providing him with the necessary kit.

It is not just Ihsan either. A number of children housed all over Scotland have found cricket clubs thanks to Guardianship Scotland, with many of them viewing Ihsan as a role model.

And yet, apart from his brother, his family were unaware of his rising stock.

For many who settle in the United Kingdom from the Asian subcontinent, there is a responsibility on them to financially support family back home. 

Ihsan played regional cricket and represented Scotland Under-17s off the back of impressive performances for GHK, but it was not until he played for Scotland A last year that he told his parents about his achievements.

"I told my parents just that I'm studying," he said. "After I was selected for the A team I told my Mum and Dad and they told me to work hard and go for my dreams.

"I have the biggest dreams. The first dream was to be selected and now the dreams are higher, to be one of the top bowlers in the world and play in leagues around the world."

Throughout our interview, Ihsan kept coming back to his determination to do his best and leave no stone unturned. 

There is no arrogance about him, just a steely confidence and a drive that is built into his psyche. 

Ihsan, along with team-mate Safyaan Sharif, received their visas after the rest of the travelling Scotland party and so were unable to play in the Scots' first warm-up match against Afghanistan.

Despite that disappointment, he still took the opportunity to pick the brains of Hamid Hassan - former Afghanistan opening bowler and now coach - and one of the sport's most experienced campaigners in Mohammad Nabi.

Global superstar Rashid Khan also came over for a chat before the game. 

These are some of Ihsan's heroes, but there are no split loyalties.

"Scotland gave me respect and believed in me," he said. "I was born in Afghanistan but my country is Scotland."

He experienced his first taste of international cricket on Wednesday, taking 1-49 as Scotland were narrowly beaten by Namibia in a high-scoring game.

The teams then played a practice super over, with Ihsan trusted to bowl for Scotland.

"He's got decent pace, he's able to deliver a yorker, slower balls and a bouncer, which in T20s are good commodities to have," assistant coach Gordon Drummond said. 

"He played his first game and it showed if you're off the mark a little bit you can get punished. The more experience he has, the more he will develop.

"He's going to learn a lot from the guys we've got out here and he really enjoyed having conversations with the Afghanistan players the other day. 

"He's quite a grounded individual and the really nice thing from [the Namibia game] was he came off the park and was annoyed at how he bowled. That shows how much character he has and his willingness to learn.

"We can't predict the future, but there's not been a huge amount of input from Cricket Scotland staff. I feel like there's a lot more in the tank and that's the exciting thing. The more he plays against top-level opposition the more he will learn."

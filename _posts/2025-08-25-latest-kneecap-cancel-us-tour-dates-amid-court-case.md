Let's dive into the details: Irish rap group Kneecap have cancelled a US tour due to band member Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh's next court hearing in London.

Mr Ó hAnnaidh, 27, who performs under the stage name Mo Chara, was charged in May, after allegedly displaying a flag in support of Hezbollah at a London gig last year.

He denies the offence and the band says its members do not support Hamas or Hezbollah. 

The case has been adjourned until 26 September.

In a statement posted on social media, the band said "due to the proximity of our next court hearing in London to the first date of the tour" they have to "cancel all 15 tour dates in October".

"With every show fully sold out, to tens of thousands of fans, this is news we are sad to deliver," it continued.

"But once we win our court case, which we will, we promise to embark on an even bigger tour to all you great heads."

The tour had been due to begin in New York on Wednesday 1 October, with dates planned in a number of major US cities. 

The rap trio, who performed in Paris on Sunday night, said their planned Canadian shows in Vancouver and Toronto will still go ahead.

Mr Ó hAnnaidh, who has appeared twice in court in London, has been on unconditional bail since his first court appearance in June

At the most recent on Wednesday 20 August, the court heard legal arguments around whether the charge was brought within the six-month time limit.

His defence team are seeking to throw the case out, citing a technical error in the way the charge was brought against Mr Ó hAnnaidh.

Kneecap have faced months of controversy over their pro-Palestinian stance.

Sharon Osborne had called for their US visas to be revoked over messaged they displayed on stage at California music festival Coachella in April.

Their performance at Glastonbury in June also drew scrutiny, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer saying he did not think it would be "appropriate". 

The BBC did not livestream the performance, which was later investigated by Avon and Somerset Police. They brought no action against the band.

Kneecap are an Irish-speaking rap trio who have courted controversy with their provocative lyrics and merchandise.

The group was formed in 2017 by three musicians who go by the stage names of Mo Chara, Móglaí Bap and DJ Próvaí.

Their rise to fame inspired a semi-fictionalised film starring Oscar-nominated actor Michael Fassbender.

The film won a British Academy of Film Award (Bafta) in February 2025.

In April, the group faced criticism after displaying messages about the war in Gaza during their set at US music festival Coachella.

In November 2024, the group won its case against the UK government over a decision Kemi Badenoch took when she was a minister to withdraw an arts grant.

Here’s what you need to know: Suryavanshi scored a 35-ball century for Rajasthan Royals earlier this year in the IPL

Teenager Vaibhav Suryavanshi smashed an astonishing 144 off just 42 balls in India A's victory over the United Arab Emirates in their Asia Cup Rising Stars T20 match.

The 14-year-old, who shot to fame by becoming the youngest player and century-maker at the Indian Premier League earlier this year, reached his century in 32 balls.

It is the joint fifth-fastest hundred in all men's T20s.

His second T20 century included 11 fours and 15 sixes as he propelled India A to 297-4 in Doha, with his side going on to win by 148 runs.

Suryavanshi hit the fastest century on record in youth one-day internationals, off 52 deliveries, in victory over England in July.

It followed his staggering 35-ball hundred for Rajasthan Royals in only his third IPL match in April, which also made him the youngest centurion in men's T20s.

It has been recently reported that Former staff at the firm behind Grand Theft Auto have told the BBC that a "devastating" mass sacking took place allegedly because they tried to unionise.

Some 31 employees were dismissed in October for what Rockstar North called "gross misconduct".

The majority were based at the gaming giant's Edinburgh headquarters, with former workers claiming they were penalised for discussing working conditions in a private online forum.

Rockstar North said it was incorrect to suggest the dismissals were linked to union membership or activities. It said it took action after staff discussed confidential information, including specific game features from upcoming titles, in a public forum.

The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) called it a "ruthless act of union-busting".

Rockstar North is one of the UK's largest game developers.

Its upcoming GTA 6 game is expected to be one of the best-selling games of all time when it is released in November 2026.

Information about game development is tightly controlled across the gaming industry, with employees often signing legally binding agreements not to share confidential information.

A group of workers have been routinely protesting outside Rockstar North's Edinburgh and London offices.

BBC Scotland News has now spoken to three of the dismissed Edinburgh workers accused of disclosing company information.

Jordan Garland, a former senior production co-ordinator, said many staff members wanted to unionise because "we were so passionate about the industry and that workplace in particular".

"We just saw it as something we could do to make it better for everyone," he added.

"So it's a little bit devastating because it's an industry that I love, and I think we all love. We couldn't really see ourselves anywhere else."

He said members of staff were discussing working conditions at the firm in a private digital forum.

Jordan added: "We were talking about working conditions, policy - not talking about projects or anything like that, just talking about conditions. 

"That to me that feels like an essential, necessary part of organising. How can you organise a workplace if you can't talk about the conditions there?"

Jordan has worked at the company for 11 years and believes he was the first employee to be dismissed on the morning of 30 October.

"The first week was definitely difficult," he said. "It was a lot of sleepless nights, a lot of tossing and turning about this. 

"But in a kind of macabre way, it's good they fired so many people because there is this really strong community element now."

Designer Jamie Trimmer worked in the gaming industry for most of his adult life before being sacked from Rockstar North.

"I've worked there, like, 18 years now," he said. "I think I'm the longest serving person that was fired. 

"It's all I know really, and then it's just sort of ripped away. I'm left not knowing what to do next really.

"I never would have expected they would hit the nuclear option of firing so many of us in one go. It does highlight the need for unions."

The group, along with fellow dismissed colleagues, are now hoping to take Rockstar North to an employment tribunal.

However, they may have to wait up to a year for their case to be heard. 

In the meantime, they are waiting to learn if they qualify for an intermediate relief hearing, which could see them reinstated in their roles or kept on Rockstar North's payroll.

The issue was also raised at Prime Minister's Questions in Westminster last week by MP Chris Murray.

Sir Keir Starmer said it was "deeply concerning" and promised to look into the issue.

He added: "Every worker has the right to join a trade union, and we're determined to strengthen workers' rights and ensure they don't face unfair consequences for being part of a union."

Sacked production co-ordinator Sarah Blackburn said the public and political support has helped her deal with the situation.

"It's massively heartening to hear actually and in a way, I'd say validating," she said.

"We've had a lot of support coming from places that I genuinely didn't expect. 

"We've had people who were in unions who previously fought fights in different industries basically just expressing solidarity and support. It's a flex of power and it's been painful to be on this side of it, but I think the support has been great."

In a statement, Rockstar North told BBC Scotland News: "Rockstar Games took action against a small group of individuals, across the UK and internationally, who distributed and discussed confidential information (including specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles) in a public forum, in breach of company policy and their legal obligations.  

"Claims that these dismissals were linked to union membership or activities are entirely false and misleading."

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Sunday's title decider was the first French Open men's final between two players aged 23 or under in more than three decades

A first major final between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, the two best players in the world, always promised to deliver.

But even the most optimistic could not have anticipated it would reach the heights it did during a breathtaking five hours and 29 minutes.

The two generational talents played out an instant classic at Roland Garros, in which Spain's Alcaraz recovered from two sets down - and saved three championship points - to retain his French Open title after a fifth set match tie-break.

Alcaraz is only the third man to win a major final after saving a championship point since the Open era began in 1968.

It was a fifth major triumph for Alcaraz, 22, who has now shared the sport's past six major titles with Italy's world number one Sinner, 23.

Sunday's blockbuster, which broke the record for the longest French Open final in history, was the first Grand Slam men's final to feature two players born in the 2000s.

If any doubt remained, this was confirmation of the dawn of a new era in men's tennis.

The 2025 French Open final surpassed the four-hour and 47-minute 1982 showpiece as the longest in the tournament's history

For more than two decades the men's game was dominated by Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer.

But Djokovic, the only remaining active member of the trio, admitted he could have played his last French Open after his latest bid for a standalone record 25th Grand Slam title was ended by Sinner in the semi-finals.

As the excitement surrounding Alcaraz and Sinner's rivalry entered the stratosphere in Paris on Sunday, the question of who could rise up and fill the void at the end of the 'Big Three' era has been answered.

Seven-time major winner Mats Wilander, who won the previous longest Roland Garros final in 1982, said on TNT Sports: "Federer and Nadal played a couple of good finals, but nothing comes close to this.

"I thought: 'This is not possible - they're playing at a pace that is not human.'

"These are two of the best athletes the human race can put forward and they happen to be tennis players. I'm not speechless often, but what a wonderful day."

This was the first meeting in a major final between two familiar foes who have become the standout performers on the ATP Tour.

Italy's Sinner, who served a three-month doping suspension between February and May, has shown remarkable consistency over the past 20 months, losing just 10 of 121 matches since the Beijing Open in September 2023.

But half of those defeats have come in his past five meetings with Alcaraz. In fact, Sinner has lost just three of his past 50 matches - all to the Spaniard.

"I think every rivalry is different," said Sinner.

"Back in the days, they played different tennis. Now it's very physical, but you cannot compare. 

"I was lucky enough to play against Novak and Rafa. Beating these guys, it takes a lot.

"I have the same feeling with Carlos and some other players. It's very special. I'm happy to be part of this."

Alcaraz, who will begin his Wimbledon title defence in just three weeks, now leads the head-to-head with Sinner 8-4.

In becoming the first man to win his first five Grand Slam singles finals in the Open era, Alcaraz ended Sinner's perfect record in major finals and his pursuit of a third-straight slam.

"Every match I'm playing against him is important," Alcaraz said.

"This is the first match in a Grand Slam final. Hopefully not the last because every time we face each other, we raise our level to the top. 

"If you want to win Grand Slams, you have to beat the best tennis players in the world."

With seven of the past eight slams going to Alcaraz and Sinner - a streak of dominance punctuated only by Novak Djokovic's 24th major title at the 2023 US Open - it remains to be seen if any other players can challenge the newly established status quo.

Alcaraz emulated his childhood hero Rafael Nadal - a record 14-time champion at Roland Garros - by winning his fifth major at the exact same age of 22 years, one month and three days.

Sinner, meanwhile, is the youngest man to reach three consecutive Grand Slam singles finals since 14-time major winner Pete Sampras in 1994.

Such statistics offer a strong indication of the trajectory they both find themselves on.

So, where does their rivalry go from here? 

The pair both have titles to defend at the two remaining slams in 2025 - Alcaraz at Wimbledon and Sinner at the US Open.

Alcaraz, who leads Sinner 20-19 in career titles, has reduced Sinner's lead at the top of the world rankings to 2,030 points.

But the reigning champion has 2,000 points to defend at Wimbledon, compared to just 400 for Sinner after his quarter-final exit last year.

"I'm sure he will learn from this match and come back stronger next time we face each other," Alcaraz added.

"I'm sure he's going to do his homework. I'm going to try to learn how I can be better [and] tactically hurt his game. 

"I'm not going to beat him forever, that's obvious. So I have to keep learning from the matches I play against him."

It has been recently reported that Winning trophies is the primary objective for Glentoran manager Declan Devine this season

Glentoran manager Declan Devine is confident the new arrivals at the Oval can help push the club on to new heights this season.

The Glens made a raft of summer signings, including striker Pat Hoban from Derry City and Scottish midfielder Liam Burt, who won League of Ireland titles with Shelbourne and Shamrock Rovers in recent seasons.

Former Crusaders duo, Jordan Stewart and Daniel Larmour, made the move to east Belfast, while Ryan Cooney arrived from Crewe Alexandra and goalkeeper Peter Urminsky joined from St Mirren on loan.

Adding such experience can not only increase the competition for places, but aid the development of the younger players according to Devine whose team opens their Premiership campaign with a trip to Portadown on Saturday (15:00 BST).

"Pat needs no introduction," Devine told BBC Sport NI.

"He spoke to five or six clubs and felt this was his best opportunity to win trophies. He can lead men too and brings an incredible professionalism about him, so he'll have a big role for us this year.

"Liam's had a lot of success wherever he's been, played in the group stage of Europe and knows what it takes to get there.

"Jordan Stewart has four or five league titles under his belt, Daniel Larmour has two Irish Cups and played 10 games in Europe, so we've brought a lot of experience to the group. Add in Ryan Cooney who has 246 games in League One and League Two in England."

Christie Pattisson and Dylan Connolly will miss Saturday's trip to Shamrock Park as their suspension following the brawl against Larne on the final day of last season carries over.

Joe Thomson is suspended for Saturday's game against Portadown

Joe Thomson is also out as the one-game ban for picking up a fifth yellow card also carries over - a situation that frustrates Devine.

"That makes no sense to me," he opined.

"Bans getting carried over for five yellow cards is madness."

Regardless, Devine is confident he has the squad to cope and is targeting a flying start to the season.

Last season, the Glens claimed the County Antrim Shield, but lost in the League Cup final to Cliftonville. They also missed out on European football, while they were stunned in an Irish Cup quarter-final against Bangor.

This term, collecting silverware is the primary objective and making a push for a first league title since the 2008-09 season.

"We were a mile off last year, but improved from what I walked into," said Devine.

"We've got to leave everything out there in every game, got to be more ruthless in our approach and not leave as many points behind us.

"It doesn't come much bigger than going away to Shamrock Park on Saturday, a really difficult venue. 

"We did quite well there last year but a lot of teams found it extremely difficult. For ourselves, it's about getting the new players integrated and letting them know what it's about."

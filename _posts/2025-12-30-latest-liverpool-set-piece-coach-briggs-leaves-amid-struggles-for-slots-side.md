According to new developments, Liverpool have conceded the joint-most set-piece goals in the Premier League alongside Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest

Liverpool set-piece coach Aaron Briggs has left the club amid continued problems in dead-ball situations this season.

The decision comes after Arne Slot's team conceded their 12th goal from a set-piece this campaign in Saturday's 2-1 win over Wolves.

After the win over Wolves, captain Virgil van Dijk said the club must improve from set plays.

He said: "The fact is we've conceded too many set-piece goals and we don't score enough.

"It's something we have to improve. I would say at least 75% of the time or even more, it's not even about the first contact. It's the second phase that is the killer.

"Is it a mental thing? I hope not. If that's in your head then it's an issue. Personally, it's not in my head."

Across the past five Premier League seasons, Liverpool's attacking threat from set-pieces has steadily diminished. In 2021-22, they scored 18 goals from corners and indirect free-kicks combined, averaging 0.47 per game.

That figure fell to 17 in 2022-23 and 15 in 2023-24 before dropping sharply to nine last season.

Briggs moved into the role in September after originally being appointed to Slot's staff at the start of the 2024-25 campaign.

Responsibility for preparing the team for set-pieces will be taken on by the rest of Liverpool's coaching staff.

Set-piece output has become a key aspect of teams across the Premier League this season and with that in mind the mutual decision for Briggs to depart, given Liverpool's struggles in the area, becomes a significant move.

According to new developments, Councils across London are set to receive £36.5m in funding to help tackle homelessness this winter. 

One in 50 Londoners are homeless and record numbers of children are in temporary accommodation, according to London Councils.

The money will target rough sleeping and families who face homelessness, the Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government (DHCLG).

Claire Holland, chair of London Councils, said the funding was "critical" in helping address "London's homelessness crisis". 

The capital will receive the largest share of the £84m being distributed to councils across England.

Of the £36.5m, measures to prevent rough sleeping will receive £28.4m, £7.1m will help families with children in temporary accommodation, while £960,000 will go on  drug and alcohol treatment for people sleeping rough or at risk of homelessness.

London Mayor Sir Sadiq Khan welcomed the investment, saying it would "support our Rough Sleeping Action Plan and work with London Councils to stop people becoming homeless".

"I have always been clear that no one should have to sleep rough on our streets," he said. 

"I will continue to work closely with the government and partners to ensure those most in need receive the support they deserve."

Homelessness charity Crisis said the funding was "very welcome" ahead of winter but called for a longer-term strategy. 

Its chief executive Matt Downie said: "More people are likely to face the prospect of sleeping on cold streets and need support urgently. 

"More parents will be working out how to help their children do homework from cramped and draughty temporary accommodation."

A DHCLG spokesperson said the funding boost was building on existing schemes such as the £950m fund to increase the supply of "good temporary accommodation".

The investment comes as data released by the Museum of Homelessness on Wednesday showed a record number of people had died while homeless in the UK in 2024. 

More than 1,100 deaths were in England, an increase of 16% on the year before.

London had the highest total number of deaths at 326, marking an increase of 16.

Homelessness Minister Alison McGovern said homelessness in the UK had been "too high for too long" and the funding would help address the "crisis made over the past decade".

"This has to stop and we are taking action in London so every corner of the country feels our Plan for Change, as we get on to build more homes and help those who need it to put a roof over their head," she added.

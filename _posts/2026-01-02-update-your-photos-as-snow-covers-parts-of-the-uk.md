Experts revealed that Snow by the sea in Stonehaven as heavy snow showers continue to affect Aberdeenshire

With most of the UK now fully in the grip of Arctic winds, a number of areas awoke to a covering of snow on Friday morning, all the way from Shetland to the south coast of England.

The sleet and snow showers that moved southwards across the country on Thursday night created a visual treat for our BBC WeatherWatchers, but also meant slippery roads and pavements for those venturing out.

The Met Office issued several weather warnings for snow and ice, with amber warnings for snow in effect from lunchtime on Friday for parts of northern Scotland.

The frigid conditions are set to persist into next week, but while further snow showers are possible for some, this weekend will be dry and sunny by day for the vast majority. 

Nights will become much colder though, with temperatures possibly dropping to minus double digits on Saturday night in a few locations in Scotland and northern England.

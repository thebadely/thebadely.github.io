Let's dive into the details: Samoa are playing at their first Women's Rugby World Cup since 2014

Women's Rugby World Cup: England v Samoa

Venue: Franklin's Gardens, Northampton Date: Saturday, 30 August Kick-off: 17:00 BST

Coverage: Live on BBC Two, BBC iPlayer, BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sport website and BBC Sport app.

Ranked 15th in the world and having been thrashed by Australia 73-0 in their opening game, Samoa's women would have every right to be nervous facing tournament favourites England next at the Rugby World Cup.

However, the amateur Samoa side view Saturday's game against the world's number one-ranked team differently.

Describing the match against the fully professional Red Roses as their "mission impossible", head coach Ramsey Tomokino has challenged his players to try to "wilt the rose" and "cause the upset of the year".

"It's the ultimate David and Goliath story, so we've just got to take our five little stones and put faith in them and see what we can do," Tomokino said.

Tomokino said the players who missed out on selection for the match in Northampton "took it really hard", but while the game comes with all the bells and whistles of facing hosts England on home soil, he believes Samoa's biggest match has already passed.

"For me, the biggest game for us was Australia," he said. "That was a game that could have changed the trajectory of our World Cup. We fell short there. 

"We've still got something to chase. You never know this weekend, we could cause the upset of the year, but it's going to be tough."

On the subject of whether big scores and one-sided games are a bad look for the tournament, the coach is quick to state that "the same thing happens at men's Rugby World Cups".

And he's right. Just two examples would be France 96-0 Namibia and Scotland 84-0 Romania at the 2023 tournament.

"We are deserving to be here because we bring a different flavour," he said. "We bring our culture and we've really embraced it."

The sacrifices made by the Samoans are clear in the stories of the six mothers in the squad.

While World Rugby pays for all sides' travel, accommodation, food and facilities, the majority of the players personally crowd-funded to attend the tournament having to leave jobs behind.

Captain Sui Pauaraisa has been given leave from her role as a clinical administrator at Christchurch Hospital in New Zealand, but it was the pull of two daughters that nearly stopped her from travelling.

"My eldest is in her last year at school. I have to wake her up soon for school," she said, as she checked the time on her phone. 

"It's that sacrifice. They both play the game and that's what I want. 

"That's why I keep coming - for these young girls coming through, and for my little ones as well - because they love the game, they love the sport. And they support me. 

"I was 50-50, but she said 'Mommy you have to do this, you've got to go'."

Prop Denise Aiolupotea has four children at home aged 15, 13, eight and three.

"You're always going to have that 'mum guilt'," she explains. "But I just hope that they'll see that I'm doing this not only for myself, but for them as well, and that anything's possible. 

"You're never too old or fragile or anything to just go out and chase what you really want to do."

The mums in the squad support each other, with number eight Nina Foaese missing her son's birthday this week and leaning on her team-mates.

"They actually help make it a lot easier," she said. "[My family] still connect through FaceTime and talk with the kids and seeing videos and stuff, but I think just being the close-knit group we are helps us. You all work together to support each other."

The evidence of the family bonds stole social media hearts when centre Fa'asua Makisi's mum surprised her, external at the end of the Australia game.

"I thought I had no family here for the game and I mentally prepared for that, but I didn't actually see her until the end of the game," she said.

"She had flown in at 8am from New Zealand and probably had zero sleep. One of my friends made up some lie to get me to go over to the stand and when I saw her, she was holding up a flag behind her and I screamed and then I started crying.

"It was a natural response. I couldn't believe she was here in England and I fully had an emotional breakdown in front of the crowd."

In a TikTok video, one of Samoa's players can be seen encouraging an England fan to give them a "chee hoo".

Asked about this, both captain and coach laughed and said it was a regular shout of joy in the group. The celebratory shout, external in Samoan culture is also regularly used by the demi-god Maui in the Disney film Moana.

And while the celebrations are expected to come from Samoa's small wins on Saturday - a big tackle or a dynamic charge up the field - the perfect future for their players would be more opportunities to play in professional environments and more Tests against top nations.

The problem is opportunities are limited. Most of the squad live in New Zealand where they play in the domestic club competition Farah Palmer Cup, but struggle for places in the bigger Super Rugby Aupiki because of limits on non-New Zealand players.

There have been discussions around a team in Australia's Super W competition, while some coaches from England's Premiership Women's Rugby have been sniffing around the squad and there could also be paid opportunities in Women's Elite Rugby in the United States.

However, Pacific Island financial struggles have long been an issue for both male and female rugby union players.

Aiolupotea reflected on the impact the team is making on young Samoan girls.

"It really touches your heart, it's something different that you can't really explain," she said. 

"Just seeing the community and the young girls look up to and aspire to be you in that same jersey, hopefully in the future.

"We look forward to the future and what the young ones do."

Hopefully we can all find a "chee hoo" for Samoa on Saturday.

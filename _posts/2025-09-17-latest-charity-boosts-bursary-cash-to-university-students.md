According to new developments, The amount of financial support a charity has offered this year's crop of new university students has increased due to the rising cost of living.

Bedford-based charity The Harpur Trust said its annual University Bursary Scheme gave 16 students from the local area £4,500 each - an increase of £1,000 from 2024.

Eshe Powell, 22, a previous beneficiary who studied at the University of the West of England, said the money given to her meant she could afford opportunities that were otherwise "out of reach".

The charity said the scheme, which started about 20 years ago, had handed out about £1m to 300 students so far.

The annual cost of an undergraduate degree in England and Wales has gone up by  3%, from £9,250 to a yearly fee of £9,535. 

Student rents have also risen sharply in recent years, alongside other living costs.

The Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) said average weekly costs for a first-year student in 2023-24 were £260 without rent, or £418 with rent included.

Across the UK, students in financial difficulty can apply for hardship funding and may also be entitled to financial assistance from charities, such as The Harper Trust.

Miss Powell, who has graduated after studying cinematography and film/video production, said her bursary meant "not feeling burdened by the additional expenses that can come with certain courses". 

"It allowed me to genuinely consider trips and experiences offered by my degree - opportunities that might otherwise have felt out of reach. 

"University is about learning and broadening your world view, but it's easy to forget that some courses come with extra costs that are essential to making the most of that experience."

Russell Terrey, 21, who is studying plant science at the University of Manchester, has also benefitted from the scheme.

He said the money given to him had "taken away the financial stress that comes with university" and had a "great impact".

"It has meant I haven't had to take up a part-time job like a lot of my friends and can dedicate that time towards my studies," he said.

The scheme is due to be opened up in January to current year 13 students in the local area.

Students who can apply must be studying at Bedford Academy, Bedford College, Biddenham International School and Sports College, Kimberley College, Mark Rutherford School, Sharnbrook Academy, The Bedford Sixth Form, St Thomas More or Wixams Academy.

The money can be used to help with study costs including accommodation, books, food, IT, transport or course materials.

Victoria Reed, the charity's grant manager, said: "We get to support students who have overcome significant personal challenges with the growing costs of studying for a degree.

"Students tell us the bursaries help them concentrate on their courses and improve their grades, and that the extra funds reduce their anxiety and stress, leading to better mental health."

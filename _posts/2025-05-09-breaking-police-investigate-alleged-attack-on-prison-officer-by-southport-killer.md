It has been recently reported that Police are investigating an alleged attack on a prison officer by Southport killer Axel Rudakubana on Thursday, according to a report in the Sun.

A Prison Service spokesperson said: "Police are investigating an attack on a prison officer at HMP Belmarsh yesterday."

Rudakubana allegedly threw boiling water over the officer, the Sun reported. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice said the officer was taken to hospital as a precautionary measure and discharged on the same day.

The 18-year-old was sentenced to a minimum of 52 years for the murder of three young girls in an attack on a dance class in the Merseyside town.

The Prison Service statement added: "Violence in prison will not be tolerated and we will always push for the strongest possible punishment for attacks on our hardworking staff."

Rudakubana killed Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, Alice Aguiar, nine, and six-year-old Bebe King at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class on 29 July 2024 in Southport.

He also attacked eight other children, class instructor Leanne Lucas, and businessman John Hayes, who had tried to disarm him.

He was jailed in January at Liverpool Crown Court for three counts of murder, 10 counts of attempted murder, and other offences including producing ricin, possessing terrorist material, and possessing a knife.

A public inquiry into the Southport murders began in April.

In February, the Attorney General rejected calls for the Court of Appeal to review the length of Rudakubana's jail sentence.

Rudakubana's minimum term of 52 years means he cannot be considered for release until he has served that amount of time in prison.

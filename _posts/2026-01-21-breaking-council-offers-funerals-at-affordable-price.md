Experts revealed that Hull City Council has launched a new website to promote its own options for an "affordable, caring and professional funeral".

The council said the site provided alternative options to keep costs down, while still having a respectful and professional funeral.

Prices start at £850, which includes the services of a dedicated bereavement officer to make all the arrangements, a spokesperson said.

Staff could also offer advice about the financial support available to help with funeral costs.

Councillor Ted Dolman, portfolio holder with responsibility for crematoria and cemeteries, said: "Our experienced, dedicated and sympathetic bereavement officers help to create a respectful, caring and personalised farewell, all at an affordable price.

"It's also important to be clear to the people of Hull that all arrangements for these funerals can take place in the city, including cremation at Chanterlands Crematorium, which is a peaceful and pleasant place to remember or pay tribute to someone."

According to financial services company SunLife, the average cost of a simple funeral burial has risen to £4,758 with a simple cremation costing £3,518.

Hull City Council is offering two types of funeral package, unattended or attended cremations, with the latter costing £975.

More details can be found on the council's website.

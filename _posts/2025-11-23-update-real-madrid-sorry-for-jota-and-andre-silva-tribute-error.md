According to new developments, Liverpool forward Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva died in a car crash in July

Real Madrid have apologised after using a picture of the wrong footballer in a video paying tribute to Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva.

The video shown at the Spanish club's ordinary general assembly featured a photo of Jota alongside a picture of Elche and Portugal forward Andre da Silva, 30.

Liverpool and Portugal forward Jota died in a car crash in July at the age of 28, along with his 25-year-old brother, who was a professional footballer with Portuguese second-tier club Penafiel.

"Real Madrid CF apologises to Elche CF and its player AndrÃ© da Silva for having mistakenly included his image in the obituary of an institutional video instead of that of AndrÃ© Silva, the brother of Diogo Jota, the Liverpool player," the club said in a statement on X.

"We regret this incident." 

Elche striker Silva, who has represented Portugal 53 times, was Jota's team-mate at Porto and also played for AC Milan, Eintracht Frankfurt and RB Leipzig.

His side drew 2-2 with Real in a La Liga encounter on Sunday. 

Earlier in November, representatives of the Madrid club - including Trent Alexander-Arnold, Dean Huijsen and manager Xabi Alonso - placed a wreath in memory of Jota at Anfield before their Champions League meeting with Liverpool. 

A card written by former Reds full-back Alexander-Arnold read: "My mate Diogo, you are so missed but still so loved. Yours and Andre's memory will always live on. I smile every time I think about you and will always remember the great times we shared. Miss you mate, every day. Love Trent and family."

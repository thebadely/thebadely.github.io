Guardiola questions two-horse title race

Pep Guardiola has questioned whether the Premier League title race this season is a two-horse race between his Manchester City side and leaders Arsenal.

Mikel Arteta's men went five points clear of City on Tuesday following an impressive 4-1 hammering of contenders Aston Villa.

Defeat meant Unai Emery's third-placed side dropped six points off the pace, but City can close the gap to two again with victory at Sunderland on Thursday (kick-off 20:00 GMT).

Asked if City or the Gunners would be the only contenders, Guardiola replied: "Are you sure?

"A few weeks it was just Arsenal, two days ago it was three [teams] in the title race. And now it is just one. We will see."

Liverpool sit fourth in the table and have an almighty task in an attempt to defend their crown, 13 points adrift of the Gunners.

City ended a forgettable and trophyless 2025 in style with an eight-game winning streak in all competitions, but head to the Stadium of Light where hosts Sunderland are unbeaten this season.

Regis le Bris' side have made an impressive return to the top-flight, sitting seventh in the table at the halfway stage.

"That means they are so tough," said Guardiola. "I remember in my first season when I went there the crowd was unbelievable. They have beaten Newcastle. Arsenal and Aston Villa could not win there.

"It will be really difficult but at the same time we are ready."

Manchester City ended a disappointing 2025 by winning eight games in a row

The winter transfer window opens on Thursday and City could see both incomings and outgoings.

BBC Sport has reported Guardiola's side are close to agreeing terms with Bournemouth to sign forward Antoine Semenyo for Â£65m.

"I have to be careful what I say," Guardiola said when asked about the Ghanaian's future.

"That is why I said yesterday before and the day of the game - the transfer window is completely closed right now."

Meanwhile, winger Oscar Bobb could head out on loan to Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund for the rest of the season, with the clubs in advanced talks.

When asked about that, Guardiola added: "When it's going to happen, it's going to happen. I don't know any news about anything right now. You can ask Oscar, not to me."

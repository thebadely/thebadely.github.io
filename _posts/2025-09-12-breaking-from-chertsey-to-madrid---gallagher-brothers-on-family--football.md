Here’s what you need to know: Conor (left) and Josh Gallagher pictured after an England game at Euro 2024

In football terms, brothers Conor and Josh Gallagher are poles apart.

One plays for Atletico Madrid, scored a winner against Real Madrid last season, has 22 England caps, and played for the Three Lions at Euro 2024.

The other once played for Leatherhead and Corinthian Casuals, and now manages Surrey part-timers Chertsey Town in the seventh tier of English football.

Conor, 25, and 32-year-old Josh might be at opposite ends of the spectrum, but they are close, support each another in their roles, and usually speak on the phone every day.

"Before each Chertsey game there's a good luck message or phone call from Conor and vice-versa," Josh tells BBC Sport.

"Conor is living the dream but always asks about Chertsey. He'll see a result and ask: 'what happened there?'"

As former Chelsea midfielder Conor prepares to return to England for Atletico Madrid's Champions League game against Liverpool at Anfield next Wednesday, Josh's thoughts are also turning to a big match for his team. 

Chertsey host Cray Valley Paper Mills at their 2,500-capacity Alwyns Lane ground in the second qualifying round of the FA Cup on Saturday. 

Should the Curfews pocket the Â£3,375 prize money on offer to the winning team, they will be two wins from playing in the first round proper for the first time in their 135-year history.

There are four Gallagher brothers in total - and all of them have played football at professional or non-league level.

Jake - Josh's elder twin by seven minutes - started out at Millwall and has more than 200 National League appearances to his name for Welling and Aldershot.

Meanwhile, 28-year-old Dan plays for Dorking Wanderers in National League South, having been on Wimbledon's books. 

All three older brothers have had a positive impact on Conor's football journey from Bookham Colts to Atletico Madrid via Leatherhead Predators, Epsom Eagles, Chelsea, Charlton (loan), Swansea City (loan), West Bromwich Albion (loan) and Crystal Palace (loan).

The England player has spoken in the past about the importance of family and how he values the advice of his brothers as well as his parents Lee and Samantha.

Speaking to the Guardian, external about his brothers in 2020, Conor said: "They have always told me to work my hardest and 'don't get too big for your boots'. 

"They have been on some journeys and they found it hard. They understand that you just have to be confident and they know I've got the ability so they don't want me to waste it."

In another interview about his family, with PremierLeague.com, external in March 2024, Conor added: "I love to impress them and when they say I do well, I believe them because they're very honest with me. 

"I'm very lucky to have a mum, dad and brothers like I do. I couldn't be luckier."

Josh flew to Spain's capital several times last season to watch Conor play for Atletico Madrid. 

Meanwhile in April 2024 - four months before his Â£33m move from Chelsea to Atletico - Conor  was among 315 fans who watched Raynes Park Vale, the club Josh managed before he was appointed Chertsey boss, against Hartley Wintney, external in the eighth tier of English football.

So will Conor be flying in from Spain to watch Chertsey play in the Southern League Premier Division South anytime soon?

"It's possible," adds Josh. "La Liga has a winter break and Conor comes back to England for about a week. There's a chance we might see him at a game around then.

"He was back last weekend during the international break to see us all, but we had an away game at Poole and it was a bit too far for him to travel.

"He likes being around it. I actually think it helps him. 

"It's nice for him to see his brothers playing or managing at a lower level, where the facilities aren't so good, the pitches aren't so great, you've got referees who are not at the top level.

"Conor hasn't been used to that because he grew up at Chelsea and has always been in a professional environment."

Conor's route to the top has not been straightforward though. He was sent out on numerous loans by Chelsea before being given an extended run in the side and had minor heart surgery in 2018 to fix an irregular heartbeat. 

"People don't realise the things he has been through to reach the level he is at," Josh says.

"He doesn't take it for granted. He's worked extremely hard for it and made sacrifices.

"I'm extremely proud of Conor, but I'm also extremely proud of all my brothers and my family."

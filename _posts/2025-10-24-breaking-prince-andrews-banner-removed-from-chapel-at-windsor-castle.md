Experts revealed that Prince Andrew's banner bearing his coat of arms has been removed at Windsor Castle as the controversy continues over his links to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

The flag, linked to his membership of the Order of the Garter, which the prince gave up last week, was on display inside St George's Chapel but is no longer hanging there.

Last Friday, Andrew announced he would also no longer use his royal titles, including Duke of York, after the publication of a posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre revived claims about his ties to Epstein.

The prince is under increasing pressure to lose further privileges, including the formal removal of his titles and his residence at Royal Lodge in Windsor. 

The book, Nobody's Girl, was written by Ms Giuffre before she died earlier this year. She accused the prince of sexually assaulting her - allegations Prince Andrew has strenuously denied. 

Prince Andrew's banner, which he was given when he became a Knight of the Garter (KG) in 2006, had been hanging in the quire - the area where clergy and the choir sit for services. 

A virtual tour of the area available on the website for St George's Chapel shows it still hanging near the door leading into the quire. It is not known when the tour was created.

However, the banner has now been removed and only three now hang in the space. It is thought it was taken down earlier in the week. 

The Order of the Garter is the oldest and most senior order of chivalry in Britain and includes other senior members of the royal family and those said to have contributed notably to public life.

Current non-royal members include former prime ministers Sir Tony Blair and Sir John Major.

Prince Andrew is facing scrutiny over his Royal Lodge home in Windsor Great Park, where he has paid a "peppercorn rent" for more than 20 years.

The government this week refused to give MPs time to debate Prince Andrew's titles or taxpayer-funded home, despite growing pressure for scrutiny.

The Metropolitan Police has said it is "actively" looking into media reports that Prince Andrew tried to obtain personal information about Ms Giuffre through his police protection.

On Friday, it emerged the prince had been paid tens of thousands of pounds by a British businessman linked to a wealth management company which ripped off pension savers.

Documents from the High Court in London showed Andrew had received Â£60,500 from businessman Adrian Gleave in December 2019, a few weeks after the BBC Newsnight interview which led to his withdrawal from public life.

Prince Andrew has also removed his royal titles from Companies House, changing his name from "HRH the Duke of York KG" to "Prince Andrew." A document was filed listing a change of his details for his start up venture Pitch@Palace. 

On 17 October, Andrew said he would stop using the titles because the "continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family".

"I vigorously deny the accusations against me," he said.

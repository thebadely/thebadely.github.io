Scorecard

Ireland bounced back from two heavy Test defeats to win the first T20 international with Bangladesh by 39 runs. 

Harry Tector's unbeaten 69 helped put Ireland in a strong position as they posted 181-4 in Chattogram.

Matthew Humphreys then claimed four wickets as Ireland tore the hosts' batting order apart. 

Barry McCarthy also took three wickets as Bangladesh could only reach 142-9, losing by 39 runs. 

"We turned up really well today," said Irish captain Paul Stirling. 

"That's as close to full strength as we've had in a long time in the T20. We welcomed back some senior figures and it showed. We came out on top."

The second of three T20s between the sides will take place on Saturday. 

Bangladesh claim Test series victory over Ireland

Ireland started well at the Bir Shrestha Shaheed Flight Lieutenant Motiur Rahman Cricket Stadium and had 40 runs on the board by the time opener Paul Stirling was dismissed for 21. 

The Tector brothers, Tim and Harry, extended Ireland's score to 71 before the former was out for 32.

Lorcan Tucker and Harry Tector helped Ireland past 100, and the tourists were in a strong position on 105-2 when Tucker was caught off Tanzim Hasan Sakib.

Curtis Campher was dismissed in the 17th over with Ireland on 142, but late hitting from Tector, who finished unbeaten on 69, and George Dockrell helped them post 181. 

Bangladesh would have looked for a strong response but Ireland's bowlers tore through their top order.

Tanzid Hasan Tamim (two) was dismissed by Humphreys in the first over, while Litton Kumer Das (one) and Parvez Hossain Emon (one) both fell to Mark Adair, leaving the hosts 5-3 midway through the fourth over. 

Saif Hassan was the next to fall on six as he was bowled by McCarthy leaving Bangladesh 18-4.

Wickets continued to tumble and Bangladesh fell well short of Ireland's total, despite the best efforts of Tawhid Hridoy who finished unbeaten on 83.

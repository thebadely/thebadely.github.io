Britain's Alfie Hewett began his bid for a third straight US Open wheelchair singles title with a commanding victory over American Charlie Cooper.

Second seed Hewett needed just 61 minutes to record a 6-0 6-2 win against the 17-year-old.

Wheelchair tennis is making its return in New York after conflicting schedules with the Paralympics meant the competition was not held last year.

Hewett, who won the title in 2022 and 2023, is chasing a second Grand Slam singles title this season after triumphing at the Australian Open in January.

His long-term doubles partner Gordon Reid won later on Wednesday, claiming a hard-fought 7-6 (7-4) 4-6 6-1 victory over Spain's Daniel Caverzaschi after two hours and 33 minutes.

Fellow Britons Greg Slade and Andy Lapthorne also made it through to the second round of the quad singles.

Slade saved three match points before wrapping up a 6-3 4-6 7-6 (11-9) win against Brazil's Leandro Pena, while Lapthorne -  a two-time winner at the US Open - beat South African Donald Ramphadi 6-2 6-3.

In the women's wheelchair singles, Lucy Shuker fell to a 6-3 6-0 defeat by Dutch 23-time Grand Slam champion Diede de Groot, who has yet to win a major title this season after making her comeback from hip and shoulder surgery.

According to new developments, Liam Manning questioned Oliver Langford's officiating record after he sent off Rob Dickie

Bristol City head coach Liam Manning says the club had called for referee Oliver Langford to be removed from their Championship play-off semi-final first leg against Sheffield United.

Langford sent off Robins defender Rob Dickie just before half-time for a foul on Sheffield United striker Kieffer Moore in the Bristol City penalty area.

Harrison Burrows dispatched the subsequent spot-kick and the Blades went on to beat their 10-man hosts 3-0 to secure a sizeable advantage heading into Monday's second leg at Bramall Lane.

"A referee was put in charge of a game he should be nowhere near," Manning told BBC Radio Bristol. "We called this week to flag our concerns with him doing it."

Langford has issued six red cards in the past 12 games he has officiated - including four in matches involving Bristol City.

He sent off two Robins players in their draw at Oxford in February and then dismissed Sunderland's Trai Hume in a City victory at Ashton Gate in April.

The Professional Game Match Officials Board (PGMOL) declined to respond to Manning's comments, but pointed to its appointments policy, external, which determines the eligibility of referees.

The BBC has also contacted the EFL for comment.

Manning : "We'll keep believing, we'll keep fighting"

"He was the one who sent [Liam] Walsh off the other week at Luton v Coventry, then it was changed because it shouldn't have been a straight red," Manning added.

That red card was overturned - although none of Langford's other recent dismissals have been successfully appealed against.

Speaking about the incident in Thursday's play-off game, Manning added: "It's almost like [Langford] can't wait to get [the card] out.

"First and foremost we didn't defend well enough leading to us being exposed at the back and then Rob on the recovery, if he pulls him, fair enough, but he actually kicks the ball.

"The only reason it should be a red if there's no attempt to play the ball. I don't know how you can attempt to not play the ball and kick it; it's madness."

According to the FA, external, a penalty must be awarded when a player "commits an offence against an opponent within their own penalty area which denies an opponent an obvious goal-scoring opportunity".

The offending player is cautioned if the foul was an attempt to "play the ball or a challenge for the ball"; but if there is no possibility to play the ball the offending player must be sent off.

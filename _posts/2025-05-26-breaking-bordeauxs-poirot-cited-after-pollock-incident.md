According to new developments, Jefferson Poirot (centre) has won 36 caps for France

Bordeaux-Begles prop Jefferson Poirot has been cited for allegedly grabbing Northampton's Henry Pollock by the throat following Saturday's Champions Cup final in Cardiff. 

Former France captain Poirot, 32, was seen in an altercation with the England flanker shortly after the full-time whistle was blown on Bordeaux's 28-20 victory.

Tournament organisers European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR), confirmed that Poirot had been charged by citing commissioner Tim Lowry, with "committing an act contrary to good sportsmanship in contravention of law 9.27".

In a statement the EPCR said Poirot's alleged act was, "dangerous and had the potential to cause serious harm."

Poirot will attend a disciplinary hearing by video conference on Thursday and faces a ban if found guilty.

Northampton rugby director Phil Dowson had described the incident as "uncalled for and out of order" and said that there had been foul play involved.

Speaking after the game, Northampton and England fly-half Fin Smith also said: "They were after him (Pollock). I don't think they liked him.

"I remember they (Bordeaux players) all sort of charged at him and were trying to get hold of him.

"I am surprised if you have just won a European Cup, the first thing you want to do is start a fight with a 20-year-old. I felt that was interesting."

Let's dive into the details: Lock Jean Kleyn has represented both Ireland and South Africa at international level

Gloucester have signed World Cup-winning South Africa lock Jean Kleyn for the 2026-27 season, after 10 years playing for United Rugby Championship side Munster.

Kleyn has been capped 10 times by the Springboks since his debut in 2023 and came off the bench for the World Cup final win against New Zealand that same autumn. 

He has also represented Ireland, playing five matches during 2019-20 including two at the 2019 World Cup, having qualified on residency grounds after signing for Munster three years earlier.

"Jean is a player I've admired for a long time. He brings real edge, experience, and a winning mentality, which will be invaluable for our group," Gloucester director of rugby George Skivington said.

"His physical presence and professionalism will raise standards across the squad, and we're excited to welcome him to Kingsholm."

The 32-year-old has made more than 150 appearances for Munster during his 10 years with the Irish club, including winning the 2022-23 URC title.

"I'm thrilled to be joining Gloucester Rugby next season," Kleyn said. 

"It's a club with incredible history and a passionate fanbase, and the vision shared with me really matched what I was looking for in the next chapter of my career."

The second row is the fourth player the Cherry and Whites have secured for next season, after Wales duo Jac Morgan and Dewi Lake and scrum-half Dan Robson.

Let's dive into the details: Manchester City finished runners-up in the Women's League Cup this season

Manchester City have joined Manchester United in signing up for the inaugural Women's World Sevens tournament in May.

The seven-a-side competition runs between 21-23 May - three days before the Women's Champions League final - in Estoril, Portugal with a prize money pool of $5m (Â£3.76m).

Manchester United confirmed their involvement last month with manager Marc Skinner hailing it as an "exciting opportunity".

The two Women's Super League clubs will battle it out with Bayern Munich, Roma, Paris St-Germain, Ajax, Benfica and FC Rosengard in the eight-team tournament.

Therese Sjogran, Manchester City Women's director of football, said the club are proud to be part of this "milestone moment".

The competition will begin with a two-day group phase before moving on to a knockout stage and a final.

Manchester City could play up to five 30-minute fixtures - depending on how far they progress.

Interim head coach Nick Cushing will oversee a side made up from the first-team squad.

City missed out on a Champions League spot for next season after drawing 2-2 with cross-city rivals Manchester United on Sunday.

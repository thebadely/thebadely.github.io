Experts revealed that Rory McIlroy hit five birdies in his third round

DP World Tour Championship third-round leaderboard

-13 R McIlroy (NI), R Neergaard-Petersen (Den); -12 A Ayora (Spa), L Canter (Eng), M Fitzpatrick (Eng), T Fleetwood (Eng), T Hatton (Eng), R Hojgaard (Den)

Selected others: -11 L Aberg (Swe), N Hojgaard (Den), J Rose (Eng); -10 S Lowry (Ire), R MacIntyre (Sco); -8 J Parry (Eng); -4 M Penge (Eng)

Rory McIlroy sank three birdies in the final five holes to move into the joint lead of  the DP World Tour Championship and close in on a seventh season-ending Race to Dubai title. 

The Northern Irishman carded a four-under-par 68 in the United Arab Emirates, during a round including five birdies and a bogey went to 13 under, along with Denmark's Rasmus Neergaard-Petersen.

England's Laurie Canter (68), Matt Fitzpatrick (66), Tommy Fleetwood (68) and Tyrrell Hatton (67) are on 12 under, along with Spain's Angel Ayora (67) and Denmark's Rasmus Hojgaard (65).

"Overall, a bit of a battling day," said McIlroy. "The conditions were tricky enough but happy to shoot the score that I did."

The 36-year-old has a 767-point lead at the top of the season-long rankings as he goes for his fourth consecutive Race to Dubai crown.

Hatton and compatriot Marco Penge are the only two who can stop McIlroy from winning the season-long title.

Hatton needs to win the tournament and have McIlroy finish worse than tied for eighth to win it.

"I'm in a better position than him [Hatton]," added McIlroy. "I'm focused on myself. If I go out and play the golf that I know that I'm capable of, especially around this golf course, I know that I'll be OK.

"It would be an amazing way to end the season."

Penge shot an improved 68 in round three after scores of 74 and 70, but looks out of contention on four under.

There will be live text commentary of the final round from 08:00 GMT on Sunday on the BBC Sport website and app.

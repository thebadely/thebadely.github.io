Let's dive into the details: Cristiano Ronaldo has scored 91 goals in 95 Saudi Pro League apperances for Al-Nassr

Cristiano Ronaldo was left out of the Al-Nassr squad for the second game in a row amid doubts over his future at the Saudi Arabian club.

Al-Nassr beat Al-Ittihad 2-0 on Friday in the Saudi Pro League after late goals from former Liverpool forward Sadio Mane and Angelo Gabriel.

A group of home fans expressed support for Ronaldo, raising yellow signs featuring his name and number seven in the seventh minute of the match.

Ronaldo, 41, also missed the club's 1-0 league win against Al-Riyadh on Monday.

Portuguese outlet A Bola, external reported that Ronaldo refused to play, having grown dissatisfied with how the club was being run by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF).

The Saudi Pro League told BBC Sport that Ronaldo has played an important role in the club's growth and ambition but added "no individual - however significant - determines decisions beyond their own club". 

Saudi league warns Ronaldo amid doubts over future

Ronaldo joined Al-Nassr after leaving Manchester United in December 2022, becoming the best-paid player in football history with an annual salary of Â£177m. 

The club, who have won 10 Saudi Pro League titles, called the signing "history in the making" but Ronaldo has only won the Arab Club Champions Cup in 2023 since the move. 

The five-time Ballon d'Or winner signed a new two-year contract in June 2025.

Both Al-Nassr and Al-Hilal - the country's most successful club with 19 league titles - are among the teams controlled by the PIF, which also backs Newcastle United.

BBC Sport has been told former Real Madrid team-mate Karim Benzema's move to league leaders Al-Hilal from AlâIttihad earlier this week was the principle reason for Ronaldo's frustration at Al-Nassr.

French striker Benzema, 38, scored a hat-trick on his debut for Al-Hilal in a 6-0 win over Al-Okhdood on Thursday.

Al-Nassr are second in the league, one point behind leaders Al-Hilal, with both having played 20 matches so far this season.

According to new developments, Dozens of parents turned up to an event offering school uniform swaps and free items ahead of the autumn term.

The summer holidays have only just started, but many families are thinking ahead to the new term or a new school â€“ and the financial challenges that new uniforms bring.

The event was held at Peterborough's Queensgate shopping centre on Friday, and the city council said it hoped it could "help cut down on their costs... while also benefitting the environment".

Parent Jessica Harper said it was "the perfect opportunity to reuse clothes that still have a lot of life left in them".

Ms Harper said the event "could really help families that are struggling".

The mother-of-two said the cost of school uniforms "is so much, and I've been trying to budget to afford uniforms for both my children, so when this event came up it was the perfect opportunity I needed without costing me so much money".

She added that it was "great to reuse clothes that still have a lot of life left in them".

Cristina Fernandez-Hierro, the recycling education co-ordinator at Peterborough City Council, said the aim of the event was to "tackle the cost-of-living crisis and also raise awareness of textile waste and the impact it has on the climate and our world".

She added: "I think if people think they're not just getting something for free but also helping the environment then they will feel proud about it."

Layla, 10, who was at the event with her mum, said: "Seeing if it fits, and seeing if you're comfortable enough, means [that when] we go to school, we will look incredible and smart."

Her mother, Sandra, added: "It's really expensive when you need to buy everything with the school uniform, so it's a great support when we can find a blazer or a PE kit for a different school."

Youth MP Danielle Daboh, who helped set up the swap-shop, said: "The event is championing reusing school uniform and also helping to alleviate the stress for families during the back-to-school period.

"It's also about signposting the environmental effects and economic benefits of events such as these, and hopefully we can do more in the future.

"It is sad to see that so many families need this but I'm happy that they're here to get the stuff that's here for them."

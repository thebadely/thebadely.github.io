Here’s what you need to know: A community shop on Wearside which runs a free second-hand school uniform scheme has moved into a larger premises to cope with a rise in demand. 

Second Chance CIC in Hendon, Sunderland, collects donations of pre-worn items which are offered to those in need for no charge.

It has moved to a new premises on Toward Road after being "inundated" with parents asking for support.

Director Wendy English said it could give out "200 items a week" because families were unable to afford to buy a new uniform on top of bills and food. 

"I had a family in the other week and they were struggling so much that they couldn't even afford to eat - and they didn't have their uniform in," she said.

"They were struggling like mad so we made sure they got everything they needed."

The group have also received thousands of pounds worth of grants from the Community Lottery Fund and Sunderland City Council, which has allowed it to buy new items of clothing.

Mrs English said: "This bigger store was exactly what we need as we simply couldn't handle the number of clothes being donated at our previous one.

"But now being able to buy new clothes and not just rely on pre-warn donations is something we've not been able to do and it's been so well received."

Mrs English said on average 20 families use the service each day.

Julianna Atola went to Second Chance to get a uniform for her four-year-old daughter, who has just started school.

"It's a big help," she said. "Their second-use clothes is just as good as new but the difference is it's no cost."

Earlier this year, the Department for Education (DfE) announced it would change the law to limit the number of compulsory branded items required by schools to three, plus a branded tie for secondary students, in a bid to cut costs for families.

The government said it believed parents in England would save about £50 per child through its school uniform measures, which it hopes to introduce next September.

However, Mrs English said it was still "not enough".

"They should just get rid of all branded items," she said.

"I'm sure it would be a massive help to families."

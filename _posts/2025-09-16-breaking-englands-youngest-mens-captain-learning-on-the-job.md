Let's dive into the details: England face Ireland in three T20 internationals on 17, 19 and 21 of September

Jacob Bethell says he will "learn on the job" as he prepares to become the youngest England skipper for a men's international match.

The 21-year-old will lead an under-strength England side in the first of three T20 internationals against Ireland at Malahide on Wednesday.

Regular white-ball captain Harry Brook and England's other all-format players have been rested for the matches.

His previous experience as captain has been with England Under-19s and Warwickshire's second XI. He has never captained at full senior level.

"I will be very chilled out, try to let everyone relax and let the talent take over," an unfazed Bethell told BBC Sport.

"Obviously it's only a short-term job standing in for Harry Brook so I'll look to reiterate the messages he's trying to take forward with this time.

"To lead the side is going to be really special. I can learn on the job without too many preconceived ideas."

Bethell will eclipse a record held since 1889, when Monty Bowden captained England aged 23 years and 144 days old in a Test against South Africa.

The young all-rounder acknowledged it was "not on his radar" to break the record but it was a "cool stat to have".

"It [captaincy] is something new to me but I prefer it that way. The boys have been very welcoming and offering advice," he added.

"It is an incredible opportunity and something I will look back on in the future."

While Bethell will become England's youngest captain in an international, Alfred 'Bunny' Lucas remains their youngest skipper in any match. 

He led what Wisden Cricketers' Almanack called an "unrepresentative" England  side in a three-day match against Gloucestershire aged just 20 in 1877.

Could brilliant Bethell give England Ashes conundrum?

It is just over a year since Bethell made his England debut against Australia in a T20 at the Utilita Bowl, and the all-rounder says it is "pretty cool" to be making his captaincy bow.

"Looking on a year from then, I'm pretty proud of what I've done in a year and pleased I've been given this opportunity," he told a news conference.

"It shows I've got a bit of backing in terms of me as a character, not just me as a cricketer. I've loved every minute so far."

England's squad for their much-anticipated Ashes tour of Australia, beginning in November, is due to be announced next week.

Bethell said he is fully focused on the task in hand amid suggestions England could pick him to bat at number three in place of Ollie Pope against the Aussies.

"My head's firmly screwed on to this series, I'm not thinking too far ahead," said Barbados-born Bethell.

"The squad's not even selected for that yet so hopefully I'm going to be there. 

"We've got a few things to do before then. Nothing's been confirmed for the Ashes yet so I've not been thinking too much about it."

Batter Jordan Cox is set to replace Brook in the middle order against Ireland while one of Sonny Baker or Scott Currie will take Jofra Archer's place in the bowling attack.

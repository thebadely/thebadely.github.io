Experts revealed that Chris Eubank Jr was hospitalised immediately after his win over Conor Benn 

Chris Eubank Jr says the dehydration clause and fight with Conor Benn left him unable "to function" for two days.

The British fighter was hospitalised immediately after his points win over Benn April.

Eubank says he was suffering from "severe dehydration".

"Obviously I had a cut that had to get stitched up," Eubank said on 5 Live Boxing with Steve Bunce.

"But the main focus was the severe dehydration.

"It caused swelling all around my face and my body. And it stopped me from being able to function for a day or two.

"They had to put a drip in me for 24, 48 hours of constant liquids going into my system. The headache was unbearable."

Eubank was subject to a rehydration clause for his contest with Benn which put a limit on how much he could weigh on the morning of the fight.

After missing the weight by 0.05lb at the weigh-in, Eubank comfortably made the 12st 1lb limit on fight day.

The 36-year-old says the weight restrictions changed the way he fought.

"I had been restricted from what I was able to eat and drink after the weigh-in, that took it's toll," Eubank said.

"I felt the effects of that during the fight. Which caused me to maybe, my legs weren't as strong as they usually were.

"It caused me to have to drag this kid into a dogfight where I am just going to keep punching until the referee stops me."

He added: "What happened in the first round was we went to war for 12 rounds.

"I can't go in there and do the same thing if I want to change the result of the fight."

A huge shock at Eubank v Benn was the unexpected arrival of Chris Eubank Sr at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

Eubank Jr was open about the pain of being estranged from his father, who had publicly spoken out against the bout.

A major appeal of the match-up was Benn and Eubank Jr were fighting 30 years after their fathers' famous rivalry in the 1990s.

Eubank Jr said he did not know until the night before the fight that his father would be attending, and confirmed the British boxing great would be attending the rematch in November.

"I'm getting ready to go to bed and then the phone call happens, 'alright son, I'm coming to the hotel'," Eubank said.

"Wow. What is going on here? You can't write it, you can't make it up.

"I would be lying if I said his presence there didn't give me that little bit extra percentage to do what needed to be done.

"Family is everything. My father has been a hero and idol of mine since I was a kid.

"So obviously if he's there, it's going to have some type of effect."

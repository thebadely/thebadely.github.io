Experts revealed that Hansi Flick won the Champions League with Bayern Munich in 2020

Barcelona manager Hansi Flick says he does not want his grandchildren to see the behaviour which earned him a red card against Girona on Saturday.

The 60-year-old was shown a yellow card for sarcastically clapping the fourth official when he indicated four minutes of stoppage time, after Barcelona missed chances with the match level.

When substitute Ronald Araujo did turn home a late winner for Barca, Flick joined the home crowd in wild celebrations and was shown a second yellow card for making an obscene gesture. 

"I don't like seeing myself in this state on television, and I don't want my grandchildren to see their grandfather like that," Flick said. "So I probably have to change my behaviour."

Speaking at a news conference before Barcelona face Olympiacos in the Champions League on Tuesday, Flick attributed the raised finger for which he was penalised to the depth of feeling he has for the club, which he has managed since May 2024. 

Flick was head coach at Bayern Munich when the German side became the first to score eight goals against Barcelona in more than 50 years in 2020, and claims to have been understated on the touchline as his team breezed into a Champions League semi-final. 

"I remember when I was coach of Bayern Munich, the footage of the match against Barca showed that I had the same reaction to the first, second and eighth goals," said Flick. "People said I never smiled! 

"Right now I'm showing more emotion, it's true, because this club has completely changed me.

"Maybe I should control my impulses, but I love Barca, Barcelona and its people, and that's why I always give my all."

Flick's red card comes with a touchline ban which will confine him to the stands of the Bernabeu as his team play Real Madrid in El Clasico on Sunday (15:15 BST) - though Barcelona are appealing against the decision. 

Barca president Joan Laporta alleged a "white hand" was behind referee Jesus Gil Manzano's officiating against Girona - referring to support for Real Madrid - though Flick himself refused to get drawn into suggestions of officiating bias.

"I had nothing against the referee," he said. "I wasn't complaining at him but he saw it that way and that's something I have to accept it."

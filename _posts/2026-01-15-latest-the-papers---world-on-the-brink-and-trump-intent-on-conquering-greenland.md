Experts revealed that Global tensions from Iran to Greenland feature prominently on the front pages of Thursday's papers.

The Guardian focuses on what's described as Donald Trump's continued interest in "conquering" Greenland. The paper reports that yesterday's talks between officials from the US, Denmark and Greenland failed to resolve what the Danish foreign minister called a "fundamental disagreement". The i Paper says Denmark and the US have "agreed to disagree" after "frank but constructive talks".

The Times reports that a US plan to attack the Iranian regime appears to be on "pause" after Trump said he'd been assured that the killing of protesters had stopped. But Trump also told reporters that he'd be "very upset" if that turned out to be false.  

The paper has a striking photograph of a woman with a painted gunshot wound on her forehead during a rally in support of Iranian protests in Rome. The Daily Mirror refers to tensions in Iran and the situation in Greenland in its front page headline: "World on the brink."

The government's decision to allow some councils in England to postpone elections due in May is the main news in the Daily Telegraph. The paper claims four million people will be denied the right to vote and says the Conservatives and Reform UK have accused Sir Keir Starmer of "running scared" of the electorate. Ministers say delaying the elections will allow more time for plans for local government reorganisation.

The Times says the chief constable of West Midlands police is resisting calls to resign, despite losing the confidence of the Home Secretary. The Daily Mail refers to the situation as a "stand-off" and says Craig Guildford is under "intense pressure" after his force banned fans of the Israeli football team Maccabi Tel Aviv from a match in Birmingham. Its single-word headline is: "Shameless."

And the Daily Telegraph highlights the efforts of 69-year-old Peter Hill, who has visited his 4,500th pub, The Mermaid in St Albans in Hertfordshire, in a quest to see every pub in the Camra Good Beer Guide.  His epic pub crawl and taken six years and cost him £66,000.

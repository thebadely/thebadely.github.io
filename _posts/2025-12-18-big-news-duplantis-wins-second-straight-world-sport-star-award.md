Duplantis named World Sports Star of the Year

Swedish pole vault star Armand Duplantis has won BBC Sports Personality's World Sport Star of the Year award for the second year in succession.

Duplantis - more commonly known as Mondo - broke the world record for the 14th time as he won a third straight world title in Tokyo in September.

The 26-year-old's clearance over 6.30m was his fourth world record of 2025 - the most times he has improved the mark during a single year in his career.

He jumped 6.27m in Clermont-Ferrand in February before improving his record by a further centimetre in Stockholm in June, and again in Budapest in August.

"Thank you so much. I am super honoured and I super appreciate it," Duplantis said after receiving his award.

Regarded as the greatest pole vaulter of all time, Duplantis has already won every major gold available to him and has the most six-metre clearances in history.

The two-time Olympic champion has claimed the past eight global men's pole vault gold medals on offer across both indoor and outdoor competitions.

Duplantis' latest triumph in Japan extended his unbeaten streak to 37 competitions, a run of dominance stretching back to July 2023.

He did so in front of a captivated audience in Tokyo, who remained in the stadium long after the night's other events had concluded to watch his latest world record bid.

The BBC World Sport Star of the Year was selected in a public vote.

American athlete Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, Spain footballer Mariona Caldentey, American boxer Terence Crawford, Japanese baseball star Shohei Ohtani and Egypt footballer Mohamed Salah were the other contenders on the shortlist.

In winning last year's award, Duplantis was chosen ahead of American gymnast Simone Biles, American basketball player Caitlin Clark, Swiss wheelchair racer Catherine Debrunner, Dutch athlete Sifan Hassan and French swimmer Leon Marchand.

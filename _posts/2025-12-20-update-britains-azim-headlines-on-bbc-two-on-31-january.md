Let's dive into the details: Adam Azim will fight for the 15th time on 31 January

British light-welterweight Adam Azim will face Argentina's Gustavo Lemos live on BBC Two and BBC iPlayer on 31 January at the Copper Box Arena in London. 

It will be the second time in 20 years that professional boxing has been on primetime linear BBC television after Jeamie 'TKV' Tshikeva and Frazer Clarke launched the BBC's partnership with Boxxer last month. 

Azim v Lemos will feature an undercard led by unbeaten British bantamweight Francesca Hennessy.

She fights Ellie Boutell in a final eliminator for the WBC bantamweight title held by Cherneka Johnson.

Azim, 23, has won all 14 of his fights, with 11 coming by way of knockout, but is taking a step up as he looks to put himself into world title contention. 

The light-welterweight was last in action on the undercard of Conor Benn's victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November with a punch-perfect display against American Kurt Scoby. 

Standing in Azim's way in January is former IBF light-welterweight title contender Lemos, 29, who Azim says is the "kind of fight I've been asking for".

"Gustavo Lemos is a dangerous fighter, and exactly the sort of opponent I need to face to prove I'm ready for the very top," Azim said.

"Fighting live on BBC Two is a huge moment for me and to do that while headlining a big event close to home in London is going to be a special moment. 

"I'm ready to put on a performance and take another step towards becoming a world champion.

"I respect Gustavo Lemos and what he has achieved in the sport, but I'm going to show the world the level I'm at. This is my time."

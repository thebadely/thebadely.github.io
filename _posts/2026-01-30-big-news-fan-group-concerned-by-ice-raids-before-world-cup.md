According to new developments, In December when receiving the inaugural Fifa Peace Prize, President Trump called the United States "the hottest country in the world right now"

Fan group Football Supporters Europe (FSE) says it is "extremely concerned by the ongoing militarisation of police forces in the US" before this summer's World Cup in North America.

It comes after two US citizens were shot dead by federal agents carrying out US President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown in Minneapolis over the past month.

US authorities have not ruled out Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids targeting undocumented immigrants at World Cup venues.

Ronan Evain, executive director of FSE, said: "At this stage, travelling fans are left with little to no information as to what will be allowed or not at Fifa venues, or what to expect from the police elsewhere in the country."

He said his organisation was also worried by "the complete absence of security doctrine from Fifa for the upcoming World Cup.

"There is no clarity as to what will be allowed in the stadiums, who will be deployed inside, which police forces will be working where."

Evain added "reports that the US has not yet invited visiting police delegations, or so-called spotters, which is unprecedented in the modern history of the tournament, only reinforce these concerns".

In response, Fifa told BBC Sport the safety and security of fans and participants was its "top priority", adding it works closely with local authorities "to plan, co-ordinate and deliver comprehensive security measures for the tournament".

"The US government will invite participating nations, host cities and host countries to deploy law enforcement representatives to the International Police Cooperation Center near Washington DC, ensuring close international co-ordination on safety and security matters," said Fifa.

"In addition, some host cities may invite international police spotters to integrate locally.

"Regarding what is permitted or not permitted inside stadiums, a Code of Conduct is made available online in line with previous Fifa events. Fifa values ongoing dialogue with stakeholders, including supporter organisations, and has presented its Safety and Security Concept on several occasions.

"Fifa is confident that these collective efforts will ensure a safe, secure and welcoming environment for everyone involved."

It added the 2025 Fifa Club World Cup in the US "provided a strong example of the safety and security measures in place".

The Trump administration has suggested it is planning to "draw down" federal forces in Minnesota if there is co-operation from officials after the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti ignited local protests and public outcry across the country. 

Trump has sent federal agents, as well as the National Guard, to major US cities over the past year to make good on his campaign promise to crack down on illegal immigration. They have been met with protests and legal challenges in Democrat-led cities like Portland, Los Angeles and Chicago.

A special task force is overseeing preparations for the World Cup, including security arrangements.

In a statement it said: "The 2026 Fifa World Cup will be the largest, safest, and most welcoming sporting event in history.

"Under President Trump's leadership, our team is working closely with Fifa, our international partners, US federal agencies, state governments, and host cities to deliver an event that highlights America's hospitality, commitment to security, and spirit of excellence. Fans from around the globe can look forward to a smooth, secure, and truly unforgettable tournament."

The UK Football Policing Unit told BBC Sport no final decisions had been reached over the presence of British police 'spotters' at World Cup matches.

Earlier this month, the European Democratic Party (EDP) said it may ask national football federations to consider pulling out of the tournament if safety guarantees are not forthcoming.

The party warned of "growing concerns over legal and administrative uncertainty, including the risk of non-transparent or discretionary visa decisions and border controls, as well as potentially invasive practices involving personal data and online activity", which it claims "may translate into concrete risks for European citizens".

This week it was revealed a branch of ICE is sending agents to help support American security operations during the Winter Olympics, which start in Italy on 6 February.

The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has stressed "all security operations at the Olympics are directed and managed exclusively by Italian authorities".

The agents will not carry out patrols and only have an "advisory" role, Washington's ambassador to Rome has said.

Let's dive into the details: Northampton Saints flanker Henry Pollock has been named in England's Six Nations squad

Northampton Saints returned to the top of The Prem after coming out on top of a 11-try thriller over Sale Sharks.

Having lost the lead to Bath following their win over Gloucester on Friday, Saints showed what they are all about with a display full of bold, attacking rugby.

Tommy Freeman and Rory Hutchinson scored in the first half, before Robbie Smith, Edoardo Todaro, Josh Kemeny, Alex Coles and Henry Pollock grabbed second-half tries.

The Sharks scored four tries of their own through Raffi Quirke, Joe Carpenter and two from Tom O'Flaherty and they led 29-26 with less than an quarter of the game to go.

But Northampton's late burst of three tries proved decisive as they claimed an eighth win from 10 Prem games to move two points clear of Bath, and a first win at this venue since 2017.

Defeat leaves Sale in seventh and with their hopes of a fourth consecutive top-four spot all but over, as they lie 16 points adrift of fourth spot.

In a heavyweight clash involving 11 of England's Six Nations squad, either starting or on the bench, it was Saints who made a blistering start.

Freeman, a likely starter for the opener with Wales at Allianz Stadium on 7 February, touched down inside the first seven minutes after a sharp reverse pass from Alex Mitchell set him up.

Northampton's slick handling was again in evidence as they spread the ball across the line with Kemeny supplying the pass for centre Hutchinson to score in the left corner.

There should have been a third score after a brilliant offload from Callum Chick and a reverse pass from Hutchinson, only for Freeman to inexplicably spill it with a try there for the taking.

And with that let-off, Quirke, bound for Newcastle Red Bulls next season, spotted a gap in the defence to dive over under the posts.

Sale ended the first half with a man less as Tom Curry was yellow carded after being adjudged to have gone high on Kemeny, but remarkably by the time Curry returned, his side were ahead.

George Ford kicked a penalty with the last kick of the first half when Mitchell gave up 10 metres for not handing the ball over to reduce the deficit to three, before Carpenter went over in the corner in the first minute after the restart to make it 15-14.

But the Saints pack took it upon themselves to restore their advantage with hooker Smith eventually the one adjudged to have got the ball over the line.

That just started an incredible period of play as the lead changed hands. O'Flaherty's first try and a superb touchline conversion from Ford had Sale back in front.

But a blistering counter attack involving Mitchell and George Furbank was brilliantly finished in the corner by Italy teenager Todaro, for his seventh Prem try of the season.

However, Sale's next attack saw them suck in defenders and Rob du Preez's kick was on the money for O'Flaherty to score again to lead 29-26.

Saints delved into their box of tricks one more time with Chick breaking through and although Mitchell was held up by O'Flaherty, superb support play from Kemeny allowed the Australia flanker to score in the corner.

This time, there was no letting it slip as Coles finished off after a number of phases near the line, before Pollock rounded things off in the only way he can, running through from halfway before spectacularly diving over.

So while Saints sit pretty for the next two months as The Prem takes a break for the Six Nations, Sale are left to lick their wounds.

Sale Sharks director of rugby Alex Sanderson said:

"We came up short in quite a few areas â set-piece early on, scrum dominance, collisions around the rucks, things that led into them having momentum and almost being able to score at will.

"That's where we fell short across the 80 minutes and probably across the season if I'm being honest. Consistent inaccuracies in too many fundamental parts of our game.

"It probably shows where we're at, at this moment in time. Northampton are a team in form, we're a team trying to find some form.

"Realistically, that's us done for the play-offs, but not the season. I am not going to give up on a season in January. No, we are going to get better. There is that to play for, and scalps to take."

Northampton Saints director of rugby Phil Dowson said:

"Alex Sanderson had said it was a huge fixture for them, so we knew there would be an emotional spike from them and we know Sale are a very good side and it would be nip-and-tuck.

"It was a mad game with the wind, that made it pretty chaotic, but we stuck to our guns enough to get away in the last 10 minutes.

"We created loads in the first half and didn't convert it and then they come straight out and score and it's game on. But I admire the way we stuck at the plan.

"It's been a long time here. We felt we've been close the last couple of years. Other sides have struggled to get results up here, so that makes it all the sweeter that we managed to get over the line in the last game in this block."

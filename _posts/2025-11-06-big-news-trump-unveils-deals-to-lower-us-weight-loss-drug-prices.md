Experts revealed that US President Donald Trump has announced deals that aim to lower the cost of popular weight-loss drugs, as pharmaceutical prices take centre stage in his administration's messaging around affordability.

Speaking alongside drug executives at the White House, Trump unveiled agreements with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. Consumers are set to pay between $245 and $350 per month for obesity drugs including Wegovy and Zepbound.

Many GLP-1 drugs, used to treat diabetes and obesity, cost over $1,000 a month without insurance or discounts.

The deals will expand Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk's access to Medicare and Medicaid, the government's public healthcare plans for elderly and low-income Americans.

Eli Lilly also said in a statement it would escape tariffs for three years as part of the agreement with the Trump administration.

An estimated 10% of Medicare beneficiaries will be eligible for expanded access to GLP-1 drugs, and will only pay $50, according to senior administration officials.

Those enrolled in Medicaid will see a rolling start date based on when states sign up to participate, the officials said.

Trump has long pushed for "most-favoured nations" prices - a policy aimed at aligning drug prices in the US with lower ones abroad.

The obesity drugs will be sold at discounted prices on the direct-to-consumer TrumpRx, a government-run website set to launch by January.

On TrumpRx, Wegovy and Zepbound will start at $350 per month on average, and drop to $250 within two years, administration officials said. The Medicare prices of Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound will be $245.

Along with Novo Nordisk's Wegovy, Eli Lilly's weight-loss pill, orforglipron, will be sold for $149 for the lowest dose, Eli Lilly said in a statement. The company's Zepbound medication will cost $299 for a starting dose.

Those prices are dependent on Food and Drug Administration approval of the pills.

"Lilly is in a unique position to work with the US government to rebalance the global system, expand access and lower costs for Americans," David Ricks, Eli Lilly's chief executive, said in a statement.

GLP-1 drugs are often not covered by private insurance. Federal law bans Medicare from covering the drugs when used for weight loss, though they usually are covered when used to treat diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Only 13 states provide coverage under Medicaid for weight loss purposes.

Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, speaking at the White House, said the deals were products of months of negotiations with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. He called obesity "the number one driver of chronic disease" in the US.

"This will be a lifesaver to them," Kennedy said. 

"It's not a panacea, it's not a silver bullet," he added, stressing the importance of dietary changes and physical exercise.

Since July, Trump has been pressuring pharmaceutical firms to lower drug prices. He sent letters to 17 drug companies in the summer, giving them 60 days to respond to his demands for lower prices.

Pfizer was the first major drug maker to reach a deal with Trump, slashing prices for some medicines by up to 85% on the TrumpRx site. Pfizer also agreed to lower prescription drug prices for Medicaid.

AstraZeneca and EMD Serono have also reached deals with the administration in recent weeks.

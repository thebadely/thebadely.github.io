It has been recently reported that The UK has sanctioned two far-right Israeli ministers over "repeated incitements of violence against Palestinian communities" in the occupied West Bank.

Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich will both be banned from entering the UK and will have any assets in the UK frozen as part of the measures announced by the foreign secretary.

It is part of a joint move with Australia, Norway, Canada and New Zealand announced on Tuesday.

In response, Israel said: "It is outrageous that elected representatives and members of the government are subjected to these kind of measures."

David Lammy said Finance Minister Smotrich and National Security Minister Ben-Gvir had "incited extremist violence and serious abuses of Palestinian human rights". 

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned the move, writing on X: "These sanctions do not advance US-led efforts to achieve a ceasefire, bring all hostages home, and end the war". 

He urged the nations to reverse the sanctions, adding that the US "stands shoulder-to-shoulder with Israel."

The US Ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, joined Rubio's condemnation, describing the move as a "shocking decision" in an interview with the BBC.

Smotrich and Ben-Gvir have also been criticised for their stance on the war in Gaza. Both ministers oppose allowing aid into the Strip and have called for Palestinians there to be resettled outside the territory.

The Foreign Office said: "As Palestinian communities in the West Bank continue to suffer from severe acts of violence by extremist Israeli settlers which also undermine a future Palestinian state, the UK has joined Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Norway in stepping up the international response."

After the announcement, Lammy said: "These actions are not acceptable. This is why we have taken action now â€“ to hold those responsible to account.

"We will strive to achieve an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the immediate release of the remaining hostages by Hamas which can have no future role in the governance of Gaza, a surge in aid and a path to a two-state solution."

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said the cabinet would meet next week to respond to what he called an "unacceptable decision".

The Foreign Office added that the five nations are "clear that the rising violence and intimidation by Israeli settlers against Palestinian communities in the West Bank must stop".

In a statement it said the sanctions against the ministers "cannot be seen in isolation from events in Gaza where Israel must uphold International Humanitarian Law".

The ministers lead ultra-nationalist parties in the governing coalition, which holds an eight-seat majority in parliament. The support of Ben-Gvir's Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) party, which holds six seats, and Smotrich's Religious Zionism party, which holds seven seats, is crucial to the government's survival.

Speaking at the inauguration of a new settlement in the West Bank, Smotrich said he felt "contempt" towards the UK's move.

"Britain has already tried once to prevent us from settling the cradle of our homeland, and we cannot do it again," he said. "We are determined, God willing, to continue building."

The minister was alluding to the period when Britain governed Palestine and imposed restrictions on Jewish immigration, most significantly from the late 1930s to late 1940s.

Israel has built about 160 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews since it occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war.

The vast majority of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law - a position supported by an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) last year - although Israel disputes this.

Speaking in the Commons on Tuesday, Foreign Office Minister Hamish Falconer said that 2024 had seen the "worst settler violence" in the West Bank in the past two decades and this year was "on track to be just as violent".

Commenting on the sanctions imposed on the two ministers, Falconer said they were "responsible for inciting settler violence" in the West Bank which has "led to the deaths of Palestinian civilians and the displacement of whole towns and villages".

Falconer said Smotrich and Ben-Gvir had continued their "appalling" rhetoric despite warnings from the UK government, and so action was taken.

The possibility of sanctioning these two ministers has long been in the pipeline. 

In October, Lord Cameron said he had planned to sanction the pair, when he was foreign secretary from 2023-24, as a way of putting pressure on Israel.

The UK's decision reflects growing popular and parliamentary pressure to take further action against the Israeli government for its operations both in Gaza and the West Bank.

It also comes after a steady escalation of pressure by the UK and other allies. 

Last month the leaders of Britain, France and Canada issued a joint statement saying that Israel was at risk of breaking international law. The UK also broke off trade talks with Israel.

In the Commons last month, Lammy described remarks by Smotrich about "cleansing" Gaza of Palestinians as "monstrous" and "dangerous" extremism.

Conservative shadow home secretary Dame Priti Patel did not directly comment on the sanctions, but said: "We have been clear that the British government must leverage its influence at every opportunity to ensure the remaining hostages [held by Hamas] are released, that aid continues to reach those who need it, and a sustainable end to the conflict is achieved." 

Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey welcomed the sanctions, but said it was "disappointing" that the Conservative government and Labour "took so long to act".

It is 20 months since Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the unprecedented Hamas-led cross-border attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.

At least 54,927 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

According to new developments, Lewis Miley became the youngest player to score for Newcastle United in the Champions League against Bayer Leverkusen last week

Lewis Miley nodded his head.

It was the morning of Newcastle United's Carabao Cup quarter-final against Fulham.

And head coach Eddie Howe had informed the 19-year-old midfielder that he would be starting at right-back for the first time following a series of injuries across the backline to Kieran Trippier, Lewis Hall, Dan Burn, Emil Krafth and, now, Tino Livramento.

As Howe put it, Miley would have just one training session to walk through "how to be a right-back".

But not only did he selflessly deliver in an unfamiliar role - he also stepped up when his side needed a match-winner, heading home in the 92nd minute.

"I'm reluctant to put more pressure on his shoulders than he's already got, but he can be as good as anyone in his position, whichever position he plays," Howe said. 

"I thought he was outstanding at right-back and he's really grown in central midfield in terms of stature and confidence and belonging, which are all really important qualities - and the goals will only add to that. 

"He's got a bit of everything so I couldn't rate him any higher."

The game had been heading for penalties after Sasa Lukic's equaliser for Fulham had cancelled out Yoane Wissa's opener.

But Miley rose highest at the near post to get on the end of Sandro Tonali's corner and send the watching Geordies wild as the holders booked a semi-final against Manchester City.

"I'm buzzing," the boyhood Newcastle fan told Sky Sports. "It's an unreal feeling. I grew up here, it couldn't be a better feeling and hopefully we progress to the final."

What a contrast to the feeling just a few days earlier at the Stadium of Light.

Newcastle players and staff recognised they won't truly be able to make amends for that damaging derby defeat against Sunderland until they meet their bitter rivals again in the reverse fixture in March.

But going out of the cup as holders on home soil would have been unthinkable after such a painful loss.

"The training ground has been a sombre place," Howe said. "We fully recognise what we did in the last game and what that left with the people of Newcastle. We had to live with that. I'm not going to lie."

Howe, tellingly, made six changes to freshen up his side for the visit of Fulham as Wissa was handed his first start since completing his protracted Â£55m move from Brentford, having recovered from a knee injury.

You could sense the DR Congo forward was in the mood, smiling as he walked out, and it only took him 10 minutes to open his account.

Fabian Schar picked out Jacob Murphy out on the right with a raking crossfield pass and the winger hit a first-time ball across, knowing Wissa would be there.

Although Fulham goalkeeper Benjamin Lecomte got a hand to the cross, he palmed the ball into the path of Wissa, who could not miss.

It was a glimpse of the poacher's instincts Wissa will bring to Newcastle. 

Wissa did not look content, however, not least after Lukic's leveller.

He was not afraid to throw his arms up and scream at his team-mates if they failed to pick him out quickly. 

He earned a huge roar after getting back to make a crunching tackle on Emile Smith Rowe at one point.

He was handed a standing ovation when he was replaced by Nick Woltemade.

Although Wissa is not 100% fit yet, clearly, he will help ease the burden on Woltemade, who endured a sobering afternoon against Sunderland, heading the ball into his own net for the game's only goal.

He will also give Newcastle something different with his pace and movement.

"I've been here and knew it was special," Wissa told Sky Sports. "Now playing with the Newcastle shirt, it is different. Very happy today.

"Winning a cup is special. They did it last year when I wasn't there, so now I want to do it."

Howe will also be determined to get back to Wembley.

This has been a curious stop-start season for Newcastle, who are 12th in the league, and who have won just two away games in all competitions this season.

There have been painful defeats against Brentford, West Ham and Marseille in recent weeks.

But the manner of Sunday's loss at Sunderland was a new low.

Out of Newcastle's 157 Premier League games under Howe, his side ranked 155th for tackles, 153rd for possession won in final third, 151st for expected goals and 143rd for ground duels won and shots at the Stadium of Light.

That's how poor they were.

But, as always, Howe and his players found support rather than hostility back at St James'.

There was a huge Howe banner in the Gallowgate End alongside one of captain Bruno Guimaraes before kick-off, while supporters repeatedly chanted "Eddie Howe's black and white army" throughout the game.

Tough tests lie in wait, but that show of support did not go unnoticed.

"I can't thank them enough," Howe added.

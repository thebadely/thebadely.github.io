Here’s what you need to know: Anthony Joshua has not had to cut any weight in his professional career

Anthony Joshua is on weight for his heavyweight fight with Jake Paul with just over two weeks to go.

The Briton fights the YouTuber turned boxer on 19 December in a six-round bout in Miami.

Joshua, 36, cannot weigh more than 17st 7lb (111kg) for the contest.

Posting a video on social media, Joshua showed he was 110.6kg as he stepped on the scales - and on track to make the weight easily.

"They must have forgot. I'm used to dealing with big weights and scales," Joshua said.

The weight discrepancy is a big talking point, with 28-year-old Paul operating mostly at cruiserweight for much of his boxing career and Joshua a two-time heavyweight world champion.

Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn said Paul's team wanted the Watford fighter to weigh in even lighter before they agreed on 17st 7lb (111kg).

Heavyweights traditionally don't cut any weight. Paul's heaviest weight was 16st 3lb (103kg) for his fight against Mike Tyson last year.

Both fighters will wear regulation 10oz gloves.

Alycia Baumgardner's unified title defence will be the co-main event on 19 December

American Olympian Jahmal Harvey's featherweight bout against Kevin Cervantes will kick off the main card for the Paul-Anthony fight night.

The six-round contest is expected to be the final bout added to the main card, which will consist of four fights.

Harvey, 23, will be facing his second professional bout when he takes on his fellow unbeaten prospect Cervantes.

Alycia Baumgardner's super-featherweight world title defences against Leila Beaudoin is the co-main event.

The American is defending her WBO, WBA and IBF titles after vacating her WBC belt earlier this year in protest over the sanctioning bodies' refusal to offer 12 three-minute rounds for women's bouts.

A boxing match between former UFC rivals Anderson Silva and Tyron Woodley is also on the main card.

Chris Weidman was scheduled to box Silva in a six-round cruiserweight bout before an injury forced him to withdraw and prompted Woodley to step in.

There are two world title fights on the preliminary card, with Cherneka Johnson defending her undisputed bantamweight title against Amanda Galle, while Yokasta Valle and Yadira Bustillos contest the WBC strawweight belt.

An additional fight on the preliminary card could still be announced.

Experts revealed that Former Arsenal footballer Thomas Partey has been charged with five counts of rape and one count of sexual assault. 

The offences are reported to have taken place between 2021-2022, the Metropolitan Police said.  

The charges involve three women, with two counts of rape relating to one woman, three counts of rape in connection to a second woman and one count of sexual assault linked to a third woman. 

The Ghanaian international denies the charges and "welcomes the opportunity to finally clear his name", his lawyer said.

The charges follow an investigation by detectives, which started in February 2022 after police first received a report of rape. 

The 32-year-old's contract with Arsenal ended on Monday after playing with the team since 2020.  

An Arsenal spokesman said: "The player's contract ended on June 30. Due to ongoing legal proceedings the club is unable to comment on the case."

The Football Association and the Premier League declined to comment.

Det Supt Andy Furphy, who is leading the investigation, said: "Our priority remains providing support to the women who have come forward.

"We would ask anyone who has been impacted by this case, or anyone who has information, to speak with our team. You can contact detectives about this investigation by emailing CIT@met.police.uk"

Mr Partey, of Hertfordshire, is expected to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 5 August. 

In a statement, his lawyer Jenny Wiltshire said: "Thomas Partey denies all the charges against him.

"He has fully cooperated with the police and CPS throughout their three-year investigation.

"He now welcomes the opportunity to finally clear his name.

"Given that there are now ongoing legal proceedings, my client is unable to comment further."

Mr Partey joined Arsenal for Â£45.3m from Atletico Madrid in October 2020, made 35 top-flight appearances last season and scored four goals as the London club finished second in the Premier League.

He also played 12 times in the Champions League as the Gunners reached the semi-finals before being knocked out by eventual winners Paris St-Germain.

Overall, he made 130 Premier League appearances for Mikel Arteta's side, scoring nine goals.

Mr Partey has also made more than 50 appearances for Ghana's national team, and most recently played at World Cup qualification matches in March.

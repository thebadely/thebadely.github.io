It has been recently reported that McCusker represented Ireland at the 2024 Olympics

Max McCusker has become the second Irish Olympic swimmer to join the controversial Enhanced Games. 

In October, three-time Olympian Shane Ryan confirmed he had signed up after announcing his retirement from swimming, a move which was condemned by Swim Ireland.

McCusker, who represented Ireland at the 2024 Paris Games, has followed Ryan's decision to join a competition that will allow athletes to use performance-enhancing substances without being subject to drug tests.

Team GB Olympic swimmer Ben Proud, four-time Greece Olympian Kristian Gkolomeev and US sprinter Fred Kerley are among those set to compete.

The first Enhanced Games are due to take place in Las Vegas in 2026 with each event awarded a total prize purse of $500,000 (Â£375,000) and $1m (Â£750,000) on offer for competitors who break world records.

McCusker, 26, competed in the men's 4x100m medley relay in Paris alongside Ryan, Conor Ferguson and Darragh Greene.

At the 2024 World Aquatics Championships in Doha, McCusker broke the Irish 100m butterfly record twice in one day with times of 52.52 and 52.31 seconds.

The former Arizona State University swimmer also set an Irish 100m butterfly record of 51.90 seconds during the Irish Open in 2024.

American Caeleb Dressel set the 100m butterfly world record in a 50m pool at 49.45 seconds in 2021, while in October 2025 Canadian Josh Liendo broke the short course record with a time of 47.68 seconds in a 25m pool.

Let's dive into the details: Enzo Maresca's Chelsea are England's last hope of winning this new-look tournament

Three-quarters of the Fifa Club World Cup quarter-final ties have been set - and teams can start plotting a route to the final.

Chelsea, England's only remaining representatives, will play Palmeiras on Saturday, 5 July (02:00 BST).

The Blues reached this stage with an extra-time win over Benfica - in a game that was delayed for two hours because of the weather.

Al-Hilal, who beat Manchester City in extra time, will face Fluminense, who surprised Inter Milan.

European champions Paris St-Germain play Bayern Munich in a meeting of two heavyweights.

There are two remaining last 16 ties to be played.

The last 16 draw in full:

28 June: Palmeiras 1-0 Botafogo (AET)

28 June: Benfica 1-4 Chelsea (AET)

29 June: PSG 4-0 Inter Miami

29 June: Flamengo 2-4 Bayern Munich 

30 June: Inter Milan 0-2 Fluminense

1 July: Manchester City 3-4 Al-Hilal (AET)

1 July: Real Madrid v Juventus (20:00 BST)

2 July: Borussia Dortmund v Monterrey (02:00 BST)

Chelsea already know their opponents, Brazilian side Palmeiras - whose teenage forward Estevao Willian joins the Blues after the tournament. That game is in Philadelphia.

PSG v Bayern Munich is a repeat of the 2020 Champions League final.

Al-Hilal v Fluminense meet in Orlando after both sides knocked out European giants.

The quarter-final draw in full:

4 July: Fluminense v Al-Hilal (20:00 BST)

5 July: Palmeiras v Chelsea (02:00 BST)

5 July: PSG v Bayern Munich (17:00 BST)

5 July: Real Madrid/Juventus v Borussia Dortmund/Monterrey (21:00 BST)

Chelsea, if they get past Palmeiras, would face Al-Hilal or Fluminense in the semi-final.

That game would be played on Tuesday, 8 July (20:00 BST).

The other semi-final, 24 hours later, would see PSG or Bayern Munich potentially play Real Madrid, if Xabi Alonso's side can get through the next two rounds. 

Both the semis and the final are being played in New Jersey's MetLife Stadium - which also hosts the 2026 World Cup final.

The final will be played on Sunday, 13 July at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey (20:00 BST).

There is no third-place play-off.

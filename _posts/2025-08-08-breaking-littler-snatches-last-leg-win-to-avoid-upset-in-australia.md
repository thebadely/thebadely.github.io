Experts revealed that Luke Littler is one of five players to to complete darts' Triple Crown

Luke Littler avoided a major upset as he won a final-leg decider 6-5 against Haupai Puha to reach the quarter-finals of the Australian Darts Masters.

The world champion averaged 91.80 and looked set to exit a world series event at the first hurdle for the first time as he laboured against world number 94 Puha.

The New Zealander led 2-0 and had the darts at 5-5 but Littler, who also lifted the World Matchplay title in July, sealed his victory with a 13-dart finish against the throw.

"It's not always the prettiest, but I am happy to get over the line," Littler told ITV X.

"I had to grind it out. I'll be honest, not much practice has been put in, people don't see behind the scenes, body clock, not sleeping, it has an effect."

The 18-year-old will now play Australian Damon Heta in the last eight, while world number one Luke Humphries will take on Mike de Decker, who advanced 6-2 against Brandon Weening.

Humphries also had a slow start in his match against New Zealander Jonny Tata, losing the first two legs, but fought back to win 6-3.

Defending champion Gerwyn Price, who beat Littler 8-1 in last year's final, overcame Joe Comito 6-3, while top seed Stephen Bunting cruised to a 6-1 success past Brody Klinge.

Heta thrashed James Bailey 6-0 in Wollongong, while Josh Rock beat Simon Whitlock 6-1 and Chris Dobey enjoyed a 6-4 success over Tim Pusey.

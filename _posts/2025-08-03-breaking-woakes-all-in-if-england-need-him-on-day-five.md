Late wickets leaves Test in balance with England needing 35 to win after dramatic day four

All-rounder Chris Woakes is "all in" on helping England secure a series win over India despite his shoulder injury, says Joe Root. 

Woakes suffered the injury while trying to prevent a boundary on the opening day of the fifth Test.

On Friday, England said "at this stage, the injury has ruled him out of any further participation in the Test".

England go into the final day on Monday needing 35 more runs to secure a 3-1 series win, with four wickets in hand. 

Woakes was seen in the England changing room late on Sunday in his whites, but still with his left arm in a sling.

Asked by BBC Test Match Special if Woakes will bat if required, Root said: "I assume so. He is desperate to do what it takes. 

"There is a lot of things that have to happen before that."

England were well positioned in their pursuit of 374 at 301-3 after Root and Harry Brook shared 195 for the fourth wicket. 

However, Brook miscued to cover, Jacob Bethell was bowled and Root edged behind with England still needing 37 to win and complete their second highest chase in Tests.

Bad light forced the players off the field shortly after before rain arrived to bring a premature end to day four.

The three quick wickets had given India renewed hope and raised the prospect of Woakes being needed to bat. 

"He's all in, like the rest of us," Root added.

"It's been that kind of series where guys have had to put bodies on the line. 

"Hopefully it doesn't come to that but he had some throw-downs in here at one point so he's ready if needed.

"It shows the character and the person that he is, that he's prepared to put his body on the line like that for England and hopefully he doesn't have to, but if it does, to get us across the line and win us an incredible series."

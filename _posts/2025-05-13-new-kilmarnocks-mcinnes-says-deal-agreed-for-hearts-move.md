It has been recently reported that Derek McInnes will take charge of Kilmarnock's final two matches of the season

Hearts and Kilmarnock have agreed a deal to allow Derek McInnes to become the new manager at Tynecastle, the 53-year-old has revealed, although talks are still ongoing before the move can be finalised.

The former Aberdeen manager will take charge of Kilmarnock's final two games of the season - including Sunday's visit by Hearts - before formally succeeding Neil Critchley, who was sacked as head coach after just six months.

"I'm led to believe that the clubs agreed terms yesterday," McInnes said. "Discussions are ongoing from that."

McInnes spoke with Kilmarnock majority shareholder Billy Bowie on Tuesday but insists he is concentrating on Wednesday's penultimate game of the Scottish Premiership season against Motherwell.

"I went for breakfast with Billy Bowie this morning and my focus is fully on finishing this season with Kilmarnock," he said.

"We've got two very important games still and we want to finish the season as strongly as possible. That's where it's at. I'm trying to be as transparent as possible."

Is McInnes the man to get Hearts beating again?

McInnes has been in charge at Rugby Park since 2022 and last season guided the Ayrshire side into Europe by finishing fourth.

His managerial career began when he took St Johnstone into the top flight in 2009 and, after a brief stint at Bristol City, he had seven years in Aberdeen, with whom he never finished lower than fourth and won the League Cup in 2014.

The former midfielder left Pittodrie in 2021 and took charge of Kilmarnock the following January, leading them to promotion to the top flight and keeping them in it comfortably since then.

"Billy is brilliant and we've got a strong relationship," McInnes said. "That's always been key for me, having that strong relationship with the owner.

"It's important to me that, if and when I leave Kilmarnock, I'll still be able to shake his hand, have a drink and talk as openly as we do now."

McInnes pointed out that he has "had opportunities, and good opportunities, to leave Kilmarnock" previously, but added: "I've always tried to do the right thing."

For now, his aim is to finish the season with five wins in a row after having already steered his side clear of relegation trouble.

Former Blackpool boss Critchley joined Hearts in October, with the side bottom of the Premiership after a poor start to the season under Steven Naismith, and steered them clear of relegation - but not into the league's top six.

They also lost the Scottish Cup semi-final to Aberdeen and, in his 35 matches in charge, the Englishman won 14 and lost 14.

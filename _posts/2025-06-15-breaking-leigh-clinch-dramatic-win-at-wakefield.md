Leigh Leopards edged out Wakefield Trinity in a thriller on an emotional day at the DIY Kitchens Stadium. 

The game was dedicated to Trinity coach Daryl Powell's toddler grandson Clarke, who has been receiving treatment for leukaemia and led the teams out when he was carried on to the pitch by his mother. 

Both sides could have won it, but Joe Ofahengaue's late try was the crucial swing moment after other scores from David Armstrong and Darnell McIntosh.

Wakefield only led for a short period in the second half despite tries from Max Jowitt, Oliver Pratt and Corey Hall.

Leigh scored inside three minutes without Wakefield touching the ball. Their pressure was relentless as they gradually pushed forward until Armstrong forced his way over the line. Ben McNamara was unable to convert.

But Wakefield hit back within five minutes through Jowitt's ninth try of the season in all competitions.

With two players spare to his right, his dummy pass unlocked the door from close range following a quick scrum. He picked himself to secure the extras with his kick.

McNamara restored parity with a penalty, before his quick pass to Armstrong unlocked the Trinity defence after McIntosh's initial counter-attack. Once again, McNamara succeeded with his kick to increase Leigh's lead to six points.

Jowitt's last-ditch tackle on the line denied McIntosh a certain try in the corner as the visitors looked to ramp home their advantage before half-time. After McNamara added another penalty, McIntosh finally crossed after a wonderful pass from Lachlan Lam for another try, but the kick was missed.

Three minutes from the break, Pratt touched down after superb Wakefield switch play from right to left. Jowitt kicked over to put the hosts back within six.

The second half was cagey, but Jowitt closed the gap further for Wakefield with a penalty before Hall's try.

Hall capitalised on a defensive misjudgement from Tesi Niu to touch down after meeting Jake Trueman's searching kick. Jowitt put Wakefield in front for the first time with his conversion.

Trinity were looking set to record a crucial win as they looked to climb into the Super League top six, but Ofahengaue struck from close range to steal it inside the final few minutes, before McNamara added the extras.

Wakefield Trinity assistant head coach Michael Shenton:

"The boys are massively deflated in there. The last two games that we've played, it's come down to our starts.

"We've given ourselves too much to do conceding three tries in the first half, which is very disappointing. 

"There's probably some attitude things there and we need to handle some of the stuff when it goes against us a little bit better."

On Daryl Powell's grandson's illness: "The awareness it's created is awesome.  It's a massive thing for Daryl and his family to go through. The club doing something like this is quite unique."

Leigh Leopards head coach Adrian Lam: 

"I thought we were courageous and resilient. Even though we were our own worst enemy, we found a way to win off the back of that.

"We're a six out of 10 at the minute and some fans might think that's harsh, but that's the reality. There's so much more improvement left. We brought Wakefield into the game with some of our actions.

"We led 18-6 and that should have been the game, but we've just got to get rid of a couple of things we're doing in games to bring opposition teams back in - but that's an easy fix."

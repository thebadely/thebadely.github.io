Here’s what you need to know: Thiaw has three caps for Germany

Newcastle United are closing in on the signing of AC Milan defender Malick Thiaw.

The centre-back is due to fly to Tyneside on Sunday night to finalise his move to St James' Park.

Newcastle have missed out on several targets this summer, including Benjamin Sesko, Hugo Ekitike, Joao Pedro and James Trafford, but Thiaw is keen to join the club.

The Germany international will undergo a medical before completing a deal reportedly worth up to Â£34.62m (40m euros), including add-ons.

Bringing in a new centre-back was a priority for Newcastle this summer as manager Eddie Howe looks to increase competition and lower the average age of an experienced squad.

Although Howe did not comment directly on Thiaw over the weekend, the head coach has previously referred to the 24-year-old as a "very good player".

Howe said he was "hopeful" of making a breakthrough in the transfer market before Newcastle's opening day clash against Aston Villa on Saturday.

"But I have been hopeful for a number of weeks," he said on Friday night. "As I've said many times, everyone behind the scenes has been working incredibly hard and has been very keen to get some movement in the transfer market.

"But it is difficult and it has to be the right player at the right price. There are a lot of conditions that have to be right for a transfer to go through.

"I do believe we can still produce a very strong team. The balance of the squad is not quite right and we know that and we hope to adjust that with some of the signings we hope to make. Let's see what happens."

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Donald Trump's links course in Doonbeg was designed by former world number one Greg Norman 

Donald Trump's golf course in County Clare has been confirmed as the host venue for the 2026 Irish Open.

Trump International Golf Links Ireland in Doonbeg will stage the event from 10-13 September next year, a week after Lahinch - also in Clare - hosts the Walker Cup between Great Britain and Ireland and the United States.

Opened in 2002, the resort was bought by US President Trump in 2014.

Masters champion Rory McIlroy won this year's Irish Open in a dramatic play-off at the K Club in County Kildare on Sunday. 

"We are incredibly proud that Trump Ireland has been chosen to host the 2026 Amgen Irish Open," said Eric Trump, the president's son and executive vice president of the Trump Organisation. 

"This tournament is one of the most celebrated events in golf, and bringing it to Trump Ireland is a true testament to the standard of excellence that's upheld at this property."

Earlier this year, Trump's Aberdeenshire golf course hosted the Nexo Championship on the DP World Tour, while last month the PGA Tour announced a return to Trump National Doral for the Miami Championship next spring. 

The Irish Open's new venue was confirmed as part of the 2026 DP World Tour's schedule, which features 42 tournaments in 25 countries. 

Like the British Masters, BMW PGA Championship and Alfred Dunhill Links Championship, the Irish Open will again take place in the run-up to the season-ending play-offs.

The 2026 schedule includes three visits to Dubai, twice in January and for the season-ending tournament in November, while the Estrella Damn Catalunya Championship has been added to the calendar in May. 

In addition to the schedule, the DP World Tour announced a number of a changes to its membership structure.

From the start of next season, the cut-off to retain a full card will be reduced from 110 to 100, while the number of cards available to top finishers in the second-tier HotelPlanner Tour will be cut from 20 to 15.

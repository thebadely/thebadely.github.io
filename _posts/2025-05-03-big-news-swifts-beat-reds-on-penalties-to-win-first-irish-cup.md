Highlights: Swifts beat Cliftonville on penalties to win first Irish Cup

Ten-man Dungannon Swifts won their first ever Irish Cup 4-3 on penalties after a spirited display helped them beat Cliftonville in the final at Windsor Park.

John McGovern headed the Swifts ahead in the first half before Rodney McAree's side then had Steven Scott sent off for two yellow card offences.

Shea Kearney fired home an injury-time equaliser for the Reds to force extra time, and after the game ended 1-1, Kearney and Luke Conlan both missed their spot kicks to help Dungannon to a historic victory.

The Irish Cup success caps off a remarkable season for the Swifts, who also finished fourth in the Irish Premiership this season and will now have a European campaign to look forward to next season.

It will feel particularly sweet for boss McAree, who as a player, was part of the Dungannon side that lost the Irish Cup final in 2007 against Linfield on penalties.

Cliftonville will now have to navigate the end of season play-offs on their quest for European football, and they will face Glentoran in the semi-final at the Oval on Wednesday.

McGovern rose highest to head Dungannon in front as he continued his fine season in front of goal

Cliftonville had the first sight of goal on seven minutes as Shea Gordon blazed over the crossbar from outside the box.

Ryan Curran then wasted a gilt-edged chance on 20 minutes after a well-worked free-kick routine. 

Gordon played it short to Luke Conlan, who in turn, found Curran, but his shot on the swivel rolled wide.

They were left to rue that miss as the Swifts scored the opener four minutes later with McGovern beating Reds goalkeeper David Odumosu to the ball as he headed home from James Knowles' corner.

That sparked the game into life as moments later, Joe Gormley shot over the crossbar as Magilton's side looked for a quick response.

Chances continued to come at both ends with Andrew Mitchell then blasting over after good work down the left from Leo Alves.

Curran had two efforts blocked before Knowles' free-kick was pushed away by Odumosu as the Swifts went in ahead at the break.

Kearney equalised for Cliftonville three minutes into injury-time

The Swifts continued to threaten from set-pieces after the restart, with Dean Curry heading wide from another Knowles' delivery.

Substitute Alex Parsons then glanced wide from Conlan's cross before controversy ensued as Scott was dismissed.

After a first-half booking, Scott received a second yellow card for a foul on Rory Hale, when it looked as though contact, if any, was minimal on the Reds skipper.

With their man advantage, Cliftonville threw caution to the wind in their search for an equaliser.

Conlan went closest, with his header bouncing off the crossbar after Hale's corner fell to him in the box before Axel Piesold forced Declan Dunne into a fine reflex save in injury time.

From the resulting corner, the ball eventually fell to Kearney outside the box, and the former Swifts youth player fired a stunning strike into the bottom corner to force extra time.

Dunne then denied Odhran Casey and Hale before Gael Bigirimana cleared Eric McWoods' goal-bound effort off the line as the Reds pressed in vain for a winner in extra time.

In the shootout, Kearney, who stepped up first for the Reds, missed while Conlan had his fourth penalty saved by Dunne.

Bigirimana, Leo Alves, Adam Glenny and Brandon Bermingham all scored to help the Swifts to a dramatic win.

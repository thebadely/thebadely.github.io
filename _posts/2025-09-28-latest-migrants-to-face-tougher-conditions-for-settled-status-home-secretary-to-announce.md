Experts revealed that Migrants will have to prove they are contributing to society to earn the right to remain in the UK, the home secretary is set to announce.

In her Labour conference speech, Shabana Mahmood will outline a series of new conditions migrants have to meet to qualify for indefinite leave to remain.

Under the proposals, legal migrants will have to learn English to a high standard, have a clean criminal record and volunteer in their community to be granted permanent settlement status.

Labour says the policy draws a clear dividing line between the government and Reform UK, which says it would abolish indefinite leave to remain.

Currently, migrants can apply for indefinite leave to remain after five years, giving them the right to live, study and work in the UK permanently.

Labour plans to double the period it takes to gain the status from five years to 10, and a consultation was announced in May as part of a package of plans to cut immigration.

Reform said it would replace indefinite leave to remain with visas that force migrants - including non-EU nationals who already have the status - to reapply every five years.

Labour says this would force workers who have been contributing to the UK for decades to leave their homes and families.

On Sunday, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Reform UK's policy was "racist" and "immoral" in an interview with the BBC.

In response, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage told the Daily Express that Labour "do not believe in border controls" and said the prime minister's comments were a "desperate attack". 

Ministers are keen for migrants to prove they have integrated in the UK if they want the settlement status.

That includes meeting conditions such as making National Insurance contributions, not taking any benefits payments and giving back to their communities.

Labour says some foreign nationals could earn earlier settlement, based on their contribution or skills.

The main theme of Labour's conference is taking the fight to Reform UK, which is leading in UK-wide national opinion polls.

In her speech, Mahmood is also expected to say patriotism "is turning into something smaller, something more like ethno-nationalism".

Mahmood will argue that "fair migration" and secure borders are integral parts of an "open, generous, tolerant" country.

She will tell party members "you won't always like what I do".

But she will warn them if the Labour government does not succeed, "working people will turn away from us" and "seek solace in the false promises" from Nigel Farage's party.

Mahmood will also speak about her parents' experience of arriving in the UK, arguing the acceptance of migrants depends on their contribution to local communities.

She will talk about how she was a victim of shoplifting, when she worked behind the counter of her family's corner shop as a child, and why that has motivated her to crack down on theft.

The home secretary will launch a "winter of action" scheme in a bid to tackle shoplifting.

This will entail police forces across the country working in partnership with local businesses.

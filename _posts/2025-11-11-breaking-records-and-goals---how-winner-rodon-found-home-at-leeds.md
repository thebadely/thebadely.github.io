Experts revealed that Joe Rodon has played every minute of Leeds United's return to the Premier League this season 

World Cup qualifier: Liechtenstein v Wales

Venue: Rheinpark Stadion, Vaduz Date: Saturday, 15 November Kick-off: 17:00 GMT

Coverage: Live on iPlayer, BBC One Wales, BBC Sounds, BBC Radio Wales and Radio Cymru, the BBC Sport website and app, plus live text commentary.

As he tried to calm the concern after defeat at Nottingham Forest, manager Daniel Farke admitted Leeds United supporters could be described as "emotional".

Which could go a long way to explaining why Joe Rodon has fitted in so well with them.

The Wales defender not only wears his heart on his sleeve, but displays it on his face.

You didn't have to be a body language expert to see the 28-year-old's City Ground frustration as Leeds managed to concede three goals for a second week in a row.

Nor what it has meant to be a match-winner in the Premier League after his first top-flight goals last month.

As Leeds' former title-winning centre-back Jon Newsome puts it: "He wouldn't make a very good poker player".

But Rodon has become something of an ace in the pack at Elland Road, with his fan favourite status going beyond just simply showing what it means.

And you don't make a near century of consecutive league appearances â and mentions alongside Norman Hunter as a result â for pure passion alone.

Instead, Rodon is showing why he had been tipped for the very top after breaking through at Swansea, and what Wales fans heading to Liechtenstein this weekend have known for some time.

"He has all the attributes to belong in the Premier League," said boss Craig Bellamy. "When we were at Burnley [in the Championship], we wanted to bring him in. We felt he was a player for the high level.

"What we're seeing now is that player."

Can you name all the clubs Craig Bellamy played for?

A player that Wales and Leeds teammate Ethan Amapdu jokes is so competitive that "if it's who gets to lunch quickest, he wants to win at that."

Hardly surprising given Rodon's bloodline of grandfather Peter who played for Bradford and uncle Chris who played top-flight with Brighton.

And the determination has long been obvious. His father, Keri â who played basketball for Wales â has previously told a story of schoolboy Joe pinning the rejection letter from Wales Under-16's selectors on his bedroom door until he won his first cap for the Under-17s.

But, as with many, that mindset can also bring its challenges.

"He had all the attributes; quick, technical, a typical Swansea player in terms of that comfort on the ball," says former Swansea City director of football Leon Britton, who was still playing when Rodon got his first taste of first team football with his hometown club.

"We played a game in the US in pre-season and he was brilliant the whole game, really impressive for a kid coming in for the first time.

"But I remember sitting next to him in the changing rooms afterwards and he was really beating himself up about a mistake he had made. Nothing major, he'd tried to play out, they nicked it and got a shot away.

"I had to have a word to remind him that he couldn't let it affect his confidence. But it was clear right away he had those standards he expected of himself."

Leeds teammates Ethan Ampadu and Joe Rodon will meet up for the World Cup qualifier against Liechtenstein and North Macedonia.

Standards â as Bellamy mentioned â many thought were made for the Premier League.

Ryan Giggs included, the Wales manager who gave him his debut within a year of his 2018 first-team debut. Giggs likened Rodon to former Old Trafford teammate Gary Pallister on account of his mix of speed and strength.

Tottenham too, it seemed, when they paid Swansea Â£11m and offered  a five-year deal.

But opportunities were limited in north London, even before and after a loan to Rennes. Wales kept faith, others wondered what the fuss was about - before a loan to Leeds gave him the chance to show it.

 "He was superb last season in the Championship," says Newsome, part of BBC Radio Leeds' commentary team who watched Farke's side clinch the second-tier title last term, Rodon signing permanently after a play-off final defeat the previous year.

"He's got that comfort on the ball, the pace makes him stand out, and has that attitude where you can see what it means â and fans will always take to you if they can see you're giving everything when you've got that white shirt on.

"But like with every player, there's that question of whether they can step up. He's been tested and come through. To be honest, he's looked more comfortable in the Premier League."

Rodon's goal against Bournemouth in September was only his second in senior English football. He followed it up with the winner at West Ham last month

And more clinical too.

Because while you would expect Rodon to lead Leeds' statistics for aerial challenges, very few would have predicted him being joint-top scorer.

He has long worn the scars of a centre-back willing to use his head to keep danger at bay â Swansea fans would sing of him heading bricks if they were aimed at goal â but the same dominance never existed at the other end.

But from being teased by teammates for having a "50 pence head" before his first goal in English football 11 months ago, he's been priceless for club and country since.

And also for those who have him in their Fantasy Premier League sides. His 46 points for Â£4.1m is among the better value-for-money defenders in the game this season so far, thanks to goals against Bournemouth and West Ham.

"That is one of my achievements here in my reign that I am most proud of," Farke said with a smile on Rodon's goal return last month, joking he warned he would drop him if he didn't improve.

But Rodon has improved. In every aspect.

His consistency â even in a slightly concerning run for Leeds and Wales â has made him one of the first names on the teamsheet and applauded by supporters.

He has missed only one competitive international in four years and started the last 97 league fixtures for Leeds, the most since Gary Kelly. The last outfield player to reach an unbroken century was the legendary Hunter.

"It's his work ethic, his professionalism," says Leeds captain Ampadu on what makes Rodon that player. 

"The combination of wanting to make himself better and the team to be at its best.

"He knows the standards the team can deliver at and when it's not right he's a big driver to make sure they get there. His performances and how he is growing is evidence of that, he's starting to show everyone what he can do."

And â as he so often does â showing everyone what it means.

Let's dive into the details: Rising ticket prices have led to numerous fan protests at Premier League grounds

More than 100 fan groups have urged Premier League clubs to freeze home ticket prices for the next two seasons.

For the 2024-25 season, 19 of the 20 clubs in the English top flight raised ticket prices, while 13 also did so for the current campaign, prompting 116 supporter organisations to call for a halt on further increases.

Clubs are being asked to freeze prices for the 2026-27 and 2027-28 seasons, share data on ticket pricing and policies with supporters, and hold discussions with fans over future pricing. 

A letter published on the Football Supporters' Association website, external reads: "Rising prices are making it harder for regular fans, especially younger generations and working-class communities, to attend matches."

BBC Sport understands the Premier League is due to meet with the FSA and fan representatives to discuss the contents of the letter in December, with numerous fan protests having taken place in recent times.

The letter also highlights the challenges posed by kick-off times being changed to suit television broadcasters, adding: "Matchdays have never been harder to plan for, or more expensive to attend."

And it goes on to say that clubs need to "stop the arms race" over ticketing and that "Â£3bn transfer windows, soaring agent fees and record wages won't be paid for by increases in ticket prices. We understand the commercial realities - but that's exactly why we need to halt the increases and work together on a more balanced approach".

The document also described an existing Â£30 cap on away tickets as a "landmark agreement" which has proved ticket price costs could be assessed.   

The Chelsea Supporters Trust - one of the signatories of the letter - added: "After two consecutive years of above-inflation ticket hikes that have hit supporters hard, the message is clear: Chelsea must now halt further home ticket price increases.

"By co-signing this statement, we are standing up for a Stamford Bridge that remains accessible, inclusive and alive with the supporters who make Chelsea what it is - today and for generations to come."

How much do Premier League clubs make from tickets?

Meanwhile, the Premier League has announced that the 2026-27 season will get under way on Saturday, 22 August.

The league is scheduled to conclude on Sunday, 30 May 2027, meaning it will start and finish later than any previous editions other than in 2019-20 and 2020-21, which were affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. 

In a statement, the Premier League said that a "congested global football calendar" and "player welfare" had led to them altering their timeframes. 

The 2025-26 campaign began on 15 August.  

Beginning next season one week later will mean a gap of 89 days from the end of the current campaign and allow for 33 days from the date of the World Cup final.

In addition, the Premier League said that its schedule will be designed to avoid "clashes with Uefa club competition dates, wherever possible", and that "over the Christmas and New Year period, no two match rounds will take place within 60 hours".

Next season the September international break will be extended so that national teams can play play four matches instead of two between 21 September and 6 October.

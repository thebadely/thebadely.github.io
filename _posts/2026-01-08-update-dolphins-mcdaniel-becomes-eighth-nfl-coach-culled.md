Here’s what you need to know: McDaniel spent four seasons on the San Francisco 49ers staff before joining the Dolphins in 2022

Miami Dolphins have fired head coach Mike McDaniel after four seasons in charge.

He becomes the sixth NFL team boss to lose his job since the regular season ended on 4 January, and the eighth ousted in all over the course of the campaign.

Miami finished with a 7-10 record, their worst performance since they finished the 2019 season with only five wins.

In his first posting as a head coach, McDaniel signed a three-year contract extension in August 2024 after the Dolphins made post-season appearances in both of his first seasons in charge.

But the Dolphins' poor start to 2025 - losing six of their first seven games - caused owner Stephen Ross to fire general manager Chris Grier and raised doubt over McDaniel, whose future would be decided by Ross when the season ended.

With the season over, Ross has opted for "comprehensive change".

"I love Mike and want to thank him for his hard work, commitment, and the energy he brought to our organisation," Ross said in a statement.

"Mike is an incredibly creative football mind whose passion for the game and his players was evident every day. I wish him and his family the best moving forward."

Ross has ties with the family of John Harbaugh, whose 18-year spell as Baltimore Ravens head coach ended when his team failed to qualify for the play-offs.

The Dolphins are yet to make contact with Harbaugh, according to ESPN,, external and the decision to fire McDaniel is reported to be unconnected to Harbaugh's availability.

It has been recently reported that The Sunday Telegraph leads on the fallout from Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin's summit in Alaska. "Trump supports Putin's land grab" reads the paper's headline. The Mail on Sunday says Ukraine's future as a sovereign nation hangs in the balance with its headline, "Zelensky trapped in Trump and Putin vice". The Sunday Express quotes former defence secretary Sir Grant Shapps as saying Ukraine is at risk of being forced into what he called "a hollow deal".

The former head of security at HMP Wandsworth in London had secret dealings with organised criminals, according to the Sunday Times. An investigation by the paper claims Bobby Cunningham met an alleged cocaine trafficker at his house, and was the subject of whistleblowing reports after transferring serious criminals to more lenient prisons. The paper says the 34-year-old was allowed to resign on medical grounds before being dismissed and receiving a compensation of around Â£160,000. Mr Cunningham - who didn't respond to the Times' request for comment - was forced to repay the money. The prisons service told the paper that it does not hesitate to take action when members of staff fall below its standards.

The former Labour leader, Neil Kinnock, has called for the two-child benefit cap to be scrapped, according to the Sunday Mirror's front page. In an interview, he has called for a wealth tax on the top one per cent of earners, which he says would lift 600,000 children out of poverty.

The Sun on Sunday says the BBC has called the police as part of an inquiry into Strictly Come Dancing, in what the paper calls "its biggest crisis". It quotes a Metropolitan Police spokesperson, who says "the investigation is in its early stages". It's unclear what it relates to. The BBC says it doesn't comment on police investigations.

The Mail on Sunday says researchers in the US are using artificial intelligence to pinpoint pregnant women's exact due date. The paper says just 4% of babies are born on their due date in the UK. The AI tool - which was developed and trained using more than two million ultrasound images - was 92% accurate, according to the report.

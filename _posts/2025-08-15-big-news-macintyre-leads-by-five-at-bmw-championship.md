Full leaderboard

Robert MacIntyre shot a six-under 64 to open up a five-stroke lead in the second round of the BMW Championship in Maryland.

The Scot, who led by three at the start of play, delivered a bogey-free card that contained six birdies to sit at 14 under overall. 

World number one Scottie Scheffler, on nine under, is MacIntyre's closest challenger,. The American managed a five-under 65 on Friday.

"I've played beautifully the last two days," said MacIntyre.

"Yesterday the putter was on fire. Today I felt like my iron play was exceptional. But I've been putting in the work the last couple of weeks to improve on what I was doing since the Wyndham."

Sweden's Ludvig Aberg is at eight under, with MacIntyre's playing partner, Japan's Hideki Matsuyama, a shot further back on seven under. Both of those players also signed for 64s at Caves Valley, in what is the second event of three that make up the FedEx Cup playoffs.

There were mixed fortunes for Tommy Fleetwood, who rolled in three birdies on the front nine only for his card to be spoiled by three bogeys in the concluding five holes. 

The Englishman is at six under a shot clear of his compatriot Harry Hall and two better off than Rory McIlroy, who recorded the first eagle of the week. 

Playing in a stellar pairing alongside Scheffler, the world number two opened with a birdie but had his progress checked by a double-bogey five on the par three fifth.

However, the Northern Irishman rallied with three consecutive birdies on the ninth, 10th and 11th holes. McIlroy then delivered the highlight of his round - landing his approach from 268 yards into just under eight feet on the par-five 16th before sinking his putt for a three.

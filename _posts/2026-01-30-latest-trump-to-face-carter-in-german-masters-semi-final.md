According to new developments, Judd Trump's two-frame lead disappeared before he battled through to victory

World number one Judd Trump will take on Ali Carter in the semi-finals of the German Masters after a 5-3 victory over Xiao Guodong in which the pair shared four centuries.

Trump compiled breaks of 107 and 105 open a 2-0 lead and then finished strongly after Guodong recovered with contributions of 104 and 120 before edging ahead by taking the fifth frame.

The world number one, however, would not be denied and took three in a row, with his Chinese opponent failing to score in two of those frames.

Neil Robertson, meanwhile, made light work of Jimmy Robertson with a 5-1 win setting up a final-four encounter with Shaun Murphy.

Murphy overcame Kyren Wilson by the same score in the afternoon session, which also saw Carter, who hit a break of 137 in frame four, defeat Stuart Bingham 5-1.

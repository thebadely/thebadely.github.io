Here’s what you need to know: Police have been given extra time to question a man arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a car ploughed into football fans during Liverpool's Premier League victory parade on Monday. Speculation over the unnamed suspect's identity makes several front pages.

The Guardian says football fans who were at the parade have criticised the traffic control measures in place at the time. Officials say procedures were in operation, including rolling road closures and hostile vehicle measures.

The Times leads on a warning from the Health Secretary, Wes Streeting, that strike action by resident doctors would "choke" the NHS.

The doctors' union, the British Medical Association, is holding a ballot on six months of industrial action and says it wants to restore real terms pay to 2008 levels. Streeting tells the paper that patients are opposed to the move, following the "significant pay rises delivered over the past 10 months".

"Last days of Rose West" is the headline on the front of The Sun. The paper says the 71-year-old serial killer is "increasingly frail", can "barely walk" and "rarely leaves her jail wing". A source says West, who has spent 30 years behind bars, is shunned by other prisoners, despite giving them gifts such as vapes.

The BBC is "letting off" over-75s who "fail to pay their TV licence fee, according to The i Paper, quoting "an insider". "Figures show the corporation is yet to prosecute anyone over that age not found to be paying the charge," it writes. 

A TV Licensing spokesperson told BBC News: "Our primary aim is to support customers, particularly those with vulnerabilities, and to help them get and stay licensed. When there is evidence that someone has avoided paying for a TV Licence when they need one, we have a duty to enforce the law and this applies to everyone. In all cases, prosecution is a last resort."

The Daily Mirror says Bob Dylan loves Jaffa Cakes. Under the headline "Mr Tangerine Man", the paper says a British photographer offered the singer one of the treats in 1978. He apparently said: "Why is this a cake, it's a cookie right?"

The Mirror's editorial says it is "great to know one of the world's greatest musicians is just as human as the rest of us".

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: People in Gaza have reacted with shock after US President Donald Trump appeared to welcome Hamas's response to his peace plan for the territory. 

Hundreds of Palestinians flooded my social media accounts and messaging apps with questions like: "Has the war ended?" and "Is this a dream or reality?"

The pace of developments overnight has left many struggling to grasp what comes next.

The movement's carefully crafted statement - thought to have been drafted with the help of mediators - stopped short of outright rejection and instead offered a qualified "yes". 

Hamas accepted Trump's terms for the release of Israeli hostages and the idea of handing over the governance of Gaza to Palestinian technocrats - but did not give a clear response to many other elements of his 20-point proposal. 

It was, many Palestinians say, a calculated reply that put the ball back in Israel's court.

Soon after it was published, Trump wrote on social media that he believed Hamas was ready for peace and called on Israel to stop the bombing of Gaza. 

Reactions among Palestinians in the territory ranged from hope to deep suspicion.

Some fear Hamas has walked into a trap, and that Israel will reclaim its hostages only to resume the war. Others believe a historic opportunity has opened to end two years of conflict. 

"I advise patience," Ibrahim Fares told the BBC.

"Don't get carried away by optimism. There will be rounds of talks over the details. The devil is always in the detail," he said. "Look at Lebanon, where even now there are still displaced people and airstrikes."

Mahmoud Daher noted on Facebook that Hamas's response was unusual for its directness.

"This time it was yes without the usual 'but' immediately after," he wrote.

"Yes to prisoner release under Trump's formula, yes to ending the war and withdrawal, yes to handing power to a Palestinian authority. The buts came only later. Hamas even played to Trump's ego with praise."

But not everyone is convinced.

Gaza-based activist and long-time Hamas critic Khalil Abu Shammala said the decision was about the movement's survival.

"They will call this wisdom - or putting the people first. But the truth is, it's about Hamas staying in power. I even doubt Hamas wrote the statement - it was too clever."

For now, Palestinians remain uncertain as they wait to see whether the words on paper can truly be enough to end the war.

According to new developments, Vardy left Leicester at the end of last season after the club were relegated to the Championship

Former Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy is set to travel to Italy to complete a move to Serie A club Cremonese.

The 38-year-old is likely to sign a one-year contract with a further year on offer should the newly promoted club avoid relegation.

The former England forward is set to fly to Italy on Sunday and complete a medical on Monday. 

Cremonese are confident they will secure a move for Vardy despite reports of competition from Dutch club Feyenoord. 

Vardy, who joined Leicester in 2012, has been without a club since his contract at the King Power Stadium expired in June. 

He is considered among Leicester's greatest ever players having led the line in their Premier League title-winning 2015-16 season. 

Vardy scored 200 goals in 500 games for the club and won the FA Cup in 2021, while he also scored seven goals in 26 England appearances.

Cremonese have won both of their opening Serie A matches, against Sassuolo and AC Milan, having returned to the Italian top flight this summer.

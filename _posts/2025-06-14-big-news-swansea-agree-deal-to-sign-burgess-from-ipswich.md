Experts revealed that Defender Cameron Burgess has won 17 caps for Australia

Swansea City have agreed a deal to sign defender Cameron Burgess from Ipswich Town.

The 29-year-old Australia international has agreed a three-year contract with Alan Sheehan's side.

Scotland-born centre-back Burgess was out of contract with the Tractor Boys this summer.

"We are delighted that Cameron will be joining us at Swansea City," said head coach Alan Sheehan.

"He is an experienced and consistent performer that has seen him rise up through the divisions in the last few years and become a full international.

"During our conversations Cameron really bought in to what we are trying to do at Swansea and I believe he will be a great addition for us on and off the pitch driving standards throughout the club, and we look forward to getting to work with him."

Burgess will become the club's fourth signing of the summer following the arrivals of Ricardo Santos, Zeidane Inoussa and Bobby Wales.

Sweden international Melker Widell also links up with Swansea this summer having joined from Danish side Aalborg in January.

Burgess started his professional career with Fulham before joining Scunthorpe United following loan spells with Ross County, Cheltenham Town, Oldham Athletic and Bury.

He had a brief stint on loan at Salford City before moving to Accrington Stanley in 2020, signing for Ipswich a year later.

He helped the Tractor Boys secure successive promotions from League One into the Premier League.

Burgess - who recently helped Australia qualify for the 2026 World Cup - featured 22 times in all competitions for the Portman Road outfit last season.

Swansea City director of football Richard Montague added: "We are very pleased to have been able to add a player of Cameron's pedigree and experience to our squad ahead of the new season.

"To bring in a player who has recently played Premier League football and been part of a successful period at his previous club is very positive.

"There was considerable interest in Cameron from a number of clubs, and we are delighted he felt that Swansea City was the right choice for him."

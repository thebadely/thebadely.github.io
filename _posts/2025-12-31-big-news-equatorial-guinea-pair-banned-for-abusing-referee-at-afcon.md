According to new developments, Carlos Akapo will miss his nation's final group game at Afcon 2025

Equatorial Guinea captain Carlos Akapo and team-mate Josete Miranda have both been suspended for four games for abusing the referee after their 1-0 defeat by Sudan at the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon).

The decision was taken by a Confederation of African Football (Caf) disciplinary panel after it reviewed the referee's report from the Group E clash on Sunday, which resulted in the National Thunder exiting the tournament.

Referee Messie Jessie Nkounkou Mvoutou stated the two players "repeatedly uttered insulting and obscene remarks" towards him and his assistants following the full-time whistle.

"These remarks were made in a context of intense anger related to the defeat, but nevertheless constitute a serious breach of the principles of respect and fair play as well as the Caf disciplinary regulations," added the Congolese official.

Two matches of Akapo and Miranda's respective bans have been suspended for a year.

Both players missed the National Thunder's final group match against Algeria on Wednesday, which ended in a 3-1 defeat.

Meanwhile, the country's football federation (Feguifut) has been fined $10,000 (Â£7,435) after its technical staff and players made "excessive and abusive protests" against decisions by the officials.

Mvoutou's report indicated there was "a progressive deterioration in behaviour on the sidelines" after Equatorial Guinea defender Saul Coco scored an own goal in the 74th minute.

Elsewhere, Caf has fined Burkina Faso captain Bertrand Traore the sum of $10,000 (Â£7,435) for "offensive remarks" made in a post-match interview after the Stallions lost 1-0 to Angola in Group E on Sunday.

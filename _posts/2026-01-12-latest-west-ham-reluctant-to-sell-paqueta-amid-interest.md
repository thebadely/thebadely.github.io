Let's dive into the details: Lucas Paqueta has been a regular starter for West Ham this season featuring in 18 league games

West Ham are reluctant to sanction a sale for Lucas Paqueta this month amid interest in the attacker from Brazil.

Sources have indicated to BBC Sport that at least two clubs in Paqueta's homeland, one of which is Flamengo, have shown an interest in the Brazil international in this transfer window.

The midfielder is said to be open to moving back to South America this month with plans behind the scenes towards a potential move back to Brazil under way.

Paqueta, who has 18 months remaining on his contract at London Stadium, is expected to leave West Ham in either this current transfer window or in the summer.

However, as things stand, the Hammers do not want to sell the 28-year-old, who is viewed as an important member of the squad. 

Paqueta has featured 18 times in the Premier League for West Ham so far this campaign, scoring four and assisting once.

Sources close to the club stress that no formal offer has been received for him yet this month.

Whether any offer is considered would depend on the value of the bid, but given Paqueta's standing as a regular in manager Nuno Espirito Santo's plans as they look to avoid relegation, it would require a significant bid for the Hammers to change their stance.

It is understood Flamengo would be willing to table an offer of about Â£35m for Paqueta. 

In December, Nuno said Paqueta is still affected by the investigation into spot-fixing charges brought against him.

The Football Association began an investigation in August 2023 and charged the Brazilian in May 2024 for allegedly getting booked deliberately "for the improper purpose of affecting the betting market".

He was cleared by an independent regulatory commission in July 2025.

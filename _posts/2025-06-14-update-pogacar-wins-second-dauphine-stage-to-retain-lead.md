Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Pogacar is a three-time Tour de France winner

Slovenia's Tadej Pogacar consolidated his lead at the Criterium du Dauphine with a second consecutive stage victory in France.

The reigning Tour de France and road world champion went clear 12 kilometres from the finish on the final ascent of Saturday's 132km 'Queen Stage' from Grand-Aigueblanche to Valmeinier.

Slovenia's Pogacar eventually finished 14 seconds ahead of his closest rival, Denmark's Jonas Vingegaard.

The UAE Team Emirates-XRG rider had taken the yellow jersey with a dominant victory in Friday's stage six and the 26-year-old now holds a lead of one minute and one second over the Visma-Lease a Bike man going into Sunday's final stage.

"I launched it and maintained a good pace to the top," said Pogacar after securing his 98th career stage win, moving ahead of French sprinter Arnaud Demare for the most by an active rider.

"Today Jonas was really strong. I did not want to go too deep myself. It was a super hot and long climb. Luckily, I had enough time to ease up in the last kilometres and recovered."

"Happy I could defend the jersey like this."

Germany's Florian Lipowitz was third in the stage but is two minutes and 21 seconds behind Pogacar while Remco Evenepoel lost more time and is now fourth overall, a further one minute and 50 seconds back.

The race, a traditional warm-up for the Tour de France, which begins on Saturday, 5 July, concludes with another mountainous stage covering 133.3km from Val-d'Arc to the Plateau du Mont-Cenis.

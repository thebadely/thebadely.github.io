Here’s what you need to know: Jens Berthel Askou steered Motherwell to their first home win over Celtic since 2013

Watch Motherwell v Celtic highlights

30/12/25

Taylor Swift being asked for money. A Netflix tycoon wanting to buy the place. A manager walking out of the club citing abuse. His homesick successor then quitting after just 12 games to head back to Germany.

A few months later, you've got Motherwell playing their best football since they beat Argentina in the 1928, while humiliating the defending champions. 

Life as a Motherwell fan in the past two years has been anything but dull. 

In a 2-0 win over a clueless Celtic, Jens Berthel Askou's footballing vision ascended to a new plane. The best they've ever played, claimed the Motherwell boss.

It's been an incredible journey since 2024 opened with a message to the music world's biggest superstar asking for cash.

But what next for the Askou era as Motherwell pass their way into 2026?

Two years ago, Motherwell posted a video. It was no ordinary video.

There was a Scotland goalie dressed as a lollipop man, a pensioner squished against a glass door and a tongue-in-cheek sign-off request from a child to Miss Swift urging her to stump up money and invest in the Fir Park club.  

It's a video that made a fair whack of Motherwell supporters cringe, as the fan-owned club attempted to reel in a big financial fish.

But, without realising it, that moment was the start of the club's journey to where they are right now.

While not to everyone's taste, it was a marker that the Lanarkshire side's board were not content to do the ordinary. Be bold.  

A few months later, Erik Barmack, the former Netflix vice-president, put forward a proposal to buy the club and help take it to the new level along with his wife.

There was talk of staggered investment. There was talk of a Hollywood A-Lister coming on board. But the offer would eventually be withdrawn. 

In November, fashion businessman Kyrk Macmillan became the club's chair, injecting youth and new ideas into the club along with a refreshed Well Society board, those chosen by fans to represent them. 

One of their early duties was finding a new manager after Stuart Kettlewell quit in January 2025, citing fan abuse as a big factor in his decision. 

It caused more unrest and disharmony among supporters at how it all played out. In the midst of it all, a new manager had to be sought.

Michael Wimmer was the answer, at least in the short term, with the former Austria Vienna head coach coming in to shake things up. He left straight after the final game of last season. 

Another big decision beckoned, but would the board return to the tried and tested given the failure of going out of the box?

The short answer is no. Askou-ball was on its way.

In the early days under former Gothenburg boss Askou, it was a tad hairy. 

In his first game, Motherwell faced FC Twente during a summer training camp. Even at the embryonic stage the new style was clear, and it was terrifying. 

Well lost 3-0 and looked horrifyingly nervous at the back as they tried to be prime Barca in their own box while turning the goalie into a ball-playing centre-half.

In Askou's first competitive game, goalkeeper Calum Ward was lobbed by Clyde's James Hilton while about four miles outside his box. It was heart-attack stuff. 

But with each game, it began to click more and more. The sight of Ward standing on the halfway line wasn't causing as many fans to choke on their pies.

Five months on, and Motherwell's scintillating, intricate and almost instinctive football arguably reached its peak against Celtic on Tuesday.

Their first goal was an uncharacteristic deep cross and header, while the second came from a high press that pounced on Celtic's haplessness.

But it's what happened around it that made it so special. Make no mistake, this is the best football many fans inside Fir Park have ever seen.

There was a ferocity about their approach, an insatiable appetite to hound Celtic. A late flurry of possession and pressure from the reigning champions skewed the stats but Motherwell were in control throughout. 

"It was an absolute football lesson, both in and out of possession," former Celtic midfielder Scott Allan said on Sportscene. 

"It was the composure and calmness of Motherwell's play. 

"There was one team that was connected and one who was totally disconnected. It's the difference between a manager who is really implementing something.

"Motherwell played better football, more exciting football than Celtic. But at the same time they had a real structure behind the ball which caused Celtic problems.

"It's both boxes, and that's what leads to a solid team."

The one black mark against Askou's name came at Hampden. 

In the League Cup semi-final against St Mirren, Motherwell were schooled by former manager Stephen Robinson in a 4-1 defeat. They never really laid a glove on the Paisley side.

Askou would have watched from a distance with more than a tinge of regret as St Mirren went on to humble Celtic in this month's final. 

Motherwell now go into 2026 in a prosperous place. The aim for the fan-owned team is firstly secure your place in next year's league. I think we can safely say that one is ticked off.

Well are currently fourth. Two points behind Rangers, five behind Celtic, and eight off leaders Hearts. 

Speak to any fan and they will cite at least half a dozen games where they've let points slip from commanding positions. Hearts at Tynecastle, Kilmarnock and Falkirk at Fir Park, to name just three.

Managing to hold on to Celtic loanee Stephen Welsh would be a huge win, as would the recruitment of an instinctive striker. A cold-blooded goalscorer is arguably the only missing piece from the Askou puzzle.

If that happens, then the best football the Motherwell fans have ever seen could threaten to deliver something even more special.

"It's an impressive win and it's a day that our supporters and everyone in the club will remember for a long time... we'll try and forget it," said Askou of Motherwell's first home victory over Celtic in 12 years.

"I think my most important words I said in the dressing room were that we are not going to let this stop us, meaning that we're not going to think now we're a fantastic team and now we've done everything because we had this signature win that everyone's talking about for us.

"What we need to do is to create something over time and over the course of the season and the three points today and the clean sheet helps on that."

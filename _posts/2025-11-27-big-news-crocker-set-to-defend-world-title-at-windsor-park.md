Let's dive into the details: Crocker beat Paddy Donovan at Windsor Park in September to become a world champion

Lewis Crocker is set to return to Windsor Park for a voluntary defence of his IBF world welterweight title next spring. 

The Belfast fighter beat Paddy Donovan by split decision to clinch the vacant belt in front of a sold-out crowd at Northern Ireland's national football stadium in September.

Crocker and Donovan's fight - a rematch of their March contest which ended in Donovan's disqualification - marked boxing's return to Windsor Park for the first time since Carl Frampton's victory over Luke Jackson in August 2018.

It is understood a defence is slated for 11 April, with an opponent expected to be confirmed in the next fortnight. 

Crocker, who is unbeaten in 22 professional bouts, has been vocal about his desire to fight Conor Benn, who defeated bitter rival Chris Eubank Jr in dominant fashion in their Tottenham Hotspur Stadium rematch on 15 November.

Speaking to BBC Sport NI in the build-up to that fight, Crocker's manager Jamie Conlan mentioned Benn and WBC champion Mario Barrios as options for the 28-year-old. 

However, Englishman Benn this week told Boxing News, external Crocker "is not really a name that is on my radar". 

With a victory in April, Crocker would be expected to return to the ring in late summer.

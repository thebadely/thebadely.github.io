'I told them and they laughed' - Postecoglou at Tottenham's Europa League victory parade

Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou told fans "season three is better than season two" as they gathered at a victory parade for the Europa League champions.

The Australian is in his second year with the club and before landing a first trophy for Spurs in 17 years, it had been anticipated he would lose his job for a poor domestic season.

His side are 17th in the Premier League table with one game remaining and only the three relegated sides have performed worse.

The club are undertood to have started the process of identifying potential replacements for Postecoglou.

However, he was loudly cheered by fans who gathered for Friday's victory parade through the streets of north London, while players spoke of their love for their boss.

And speaking to fans from outside the club's stadium before the Europa League trophy was lifted, Postecoglou suggested better times lay ahead for them.

"All the best TV series, season three is better than season two," he said, to loud cheers of approval.

Winning the Europa League means Spurs have qualified for next season's Champions League competition.

Earlier in the season, the manager had promised to deliver silverware.

"I always win things in my second year. Nothing has changed. I don't say things unless I believe them," Postecoglou said in September.

But as the disappointing Premier League campaign wore on, it was a comment critics were keen to remind him of.

And that was not lost on the manager at Friday's parade to celebrate the trophy after beating Manchester United in Wednesday's final in Bilbao.

"I told them. And they laughed," he said.

This week, Postecoglou said one reason for the disappointing league results was that once the January window closed he decided to focus the team's attentions on winning the Europa League.

And speaking earlier on the team's parade bus, he told  the Tottenham Hotspur Youtube channel: "What the history books say is we're the Europa Cup winners and it doesn't say how we did it."

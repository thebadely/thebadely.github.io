It has been recently reported that The Kansas City Chiefs may have to win all five remaining games just to stand a chance of making the NFL play-offs

The Kansas City Chiefs' play-off hopes are hanging by a thread after losing 31-28 at the Dallas Cowboys on Thanksgiving.

The Cowboys have traditionally hosted games on the American holiday since 1966 and 'America's Team' produced a superb performance to overcome the Chiefs despite Patrick Mahomes throwing four touchdown passes as he returned to his native Texas.

Mahomes has led the Chiefs to five of the past six Super Bowls, winning three, but they now have a 6-6 record and are in danger of missing out on the play-offs for the  first time since the 2014 season.

The Cowboys came from behind to lead 17-14 at half-time, but a tense finish began with the Chiefs taking a 21-20 lead at the start of the fourth quarter.

Quarterback Dak Prescott then held his nerve as Dallas scored 11 points on their next two possessions to keep them clear, despite a late Chiefs reply.

The Cowboys have now claimed back-to-back wins over both of last season's Super Bowl teams in just five days after beating the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday.

After a stirring 21-point comeback against the Eagles - who denied the Chiefs a three-peat in February - the win over Kansas City is a third in a row for Dallas, to improve to 6-5-1 and keep alive their own hopes of sneaking into the post-season.

With five games left, Dallas are second to the Eagles (8-3) in the NFC East while the Chiefs trail both the Denver Broncos (9-2) and Los Angeles Chargers (7-4) in the AFC West.

As it happened - Cowboys hold on to beat Chiefs after Packers win at Lions

Why are there NFL matches on Thanksgiving?

The Green Bay Packers kept the pressure on the Chicago Bears as they won 31-24 at another of their NFC North divisional rivals, Detroit.

The Lions have hosted Thanksgiving games since 1934 but slipped to a 7-5 record as they failed to contain a Packers offence well led by Jordan Love.

The Green Bay quarterback threw for 234 passing yards and a season-high four touchdowns to keep his team in front throughout, leading 17-14 at half-time.

Dontayvion Wicks scored a touchdown in the second and third quarters to help the Packers to a third straight win and improve to 8-3-1.

The Bears top the NFC North on 8-3 and visit Philadelphia on Black Friday before travelling to Green Bay next week.

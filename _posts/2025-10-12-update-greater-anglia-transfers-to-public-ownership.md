It has been recently reported that Greater Anglia has become the latest rail operator to enter into public ownership as part of the government's renationalisation of the network. 

The company runs trains from Cambridge, Ipswich, Norwich and Colchester to London, as well as Stansted Airport, Peterborough, Hertford and smaller lines.

Its transfer on Sunday means half of all rail operators are publicly owned, which Greater Anglia described as another step towards a "more unified" network of Great British Railways.

"Passengers commuting into Norwich or heading for a day out in Cambridge will be travelling on services that are owned by the public, and run with their interests front of mind," said Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander. 

"We're reforming a fragmented system and laying the foundations for a more reliable, efficient and accountable railway - one that puts passengers first and delivers the high standards they rightly expect."

Last week Greater Anglia, which handled 81.8 million passenger journeys in 2024-25, was named Rail Operator of the Year at the National Transport Awards.

The Department for Transport (DfT) said the company, with government support, would continue to deliver regional growth. 

Two new stations are opening — Beaulieu Park in north Chelmsford this month and Cambridge South early next year — and the operator has a new fleet of bi-mode trains. 

Greater Anglia's managing director Martin Beable said the move was an "exciting opportunity" to build on its success.

"By working more closely with the wider family of publicly owned operators, we can share expertise, drive innovation, and deliver even better journeys for our passengers across the Anglia region," he added.

"This transition also brings us one step closer to Great British Railways - a simpler, more unified network that puts passengers at its heart. 

"Together, we can create a railway that drives growth, sustainability, and pride for the communities we serve and right across the UK."

Greater Anglia joins c2c, Northern, TransPennine Express, Southeastern, LNER and South Western Railway, which are currently operated by DfT Operator Limited (DFTO) on behalf of the government.

West Midlands Trains services will transfer back to the state on 1 February, followed by Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) on 31 May, with Chiltern Railways and Great Western Railways services expected to follow, the DfT said.

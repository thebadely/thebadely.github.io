Let's dive into the details: High business rates could lead to a coffee shop closure, its owner said.

Joe Ingleton, who has runs Fueled Coffee in Uttoxeter for four years, said his business rates had more than doubled.

"We charge £3.40 for a coffee and I don't think they realise how many coffees I have to sell to get that covered before I start with the wage, rent, electric bills," he said.

He said he wanted more support from East Staffordshire Borough Council. The council said the government in recent tax years had set the Retail, Hospitality and Leisure (RHL) relief at 75% of the business rates bill, but the level of relief had been reduced to 40%.

He said he previously paid £3,243 in business rates charges but his bill for 2025/26  increased to £7,784.

"I can't carry on with these high [business] rates," he told BBC Radio Stoke. 

"Sometimes I feel sick, I cant sleep, I just want to stay indoors and its not motivational at all.

"The council say it's for small businesses, this is their chance to stand up and say its wrong."

Mr Ingleton said he was passionate about the community and his business but  found the current business rates were affecting his mental health.

A council spokesman said the increase in business rates was due to government providing RHL businesses with a relief on their business rates charges over the last few years.

"In 2023/24 and 2024/25 tax years the RHL relief was set by the government at 75% of the business rates bill," they said.

"However for the 2025/26 tax year the level of relief has been reduced by the government to 40%."

Experts revealed that The UK inflation rate has remained stable at 3.8% in September, which was lower than expectations, official figures show.

Britain's inflation rate was also 3.8% in July and August, according to the Office for National Statistics, which is still much higher than the Bank of England's 2% target.

However, the central bank's economists had forecast inflation to rise to 4% in September.

ONS chief economist Grant Fitzner said: "The largest upward drivers came from petrol prices and airfares, where the fall in prices eased in comparison to last year."

He added: "These were offset by lower prices for a range of recreational and cultural purchases including live events."

The inflation figures for the past three months were the joint-highest recorded since January 2024, when the rate was 4%, according to the Office for National Statistics.

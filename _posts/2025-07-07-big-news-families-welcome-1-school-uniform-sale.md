It has been recently reported that Families have welcomed a charity-run £1 school uniform sale, saying "every little bit helps" with increasing costs of living. 

Rebuild with Hope launched the initiative this week, with more pop-ups to take place across Greater Manchester throughout the year. 

Cath Potts said she came to buy uniforms at the sale to "keep the cost down" for her daughter who was starting school in September. 

"Every little bit helps, and it helps [the money] go towards something else for the kids instead," she told BBC Radio Manchester. 

Shopper Sandra Turton, who chanced upon the sale in Wigan, said it was "absolutely brilliant". 

"I've got shirts and trousers for a 14-year-old, which usually cost £20 a pair at £2 for two pairs," she said.  

She added: "Children grow so quickly and uniforms are so expensive."

Louise Atherton,  chief executive and founder of Rebuild With Hope said the initiative was inspired by the charity's work in disadvantaged communities where "people can't afford the basics any more".

The charity was also hosting similar projects in Runcorn and Wrexham.

Ms Atherton said: "We had a lot of uniforms donated to us, but a lot of families didn't want charity they felt better if they paid for the time so we launched this sale."

She said at least 2,000 families had benefited, buying an average of five or six items meaning they had sold thousands of garments and shoes so far.

Ms Atherton added: "I think it is brilliant what has happened - not only have we been able to help families but it has also raised the profile of the charity."

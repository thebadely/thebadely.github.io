Donald 'so proud' of his European team

United States captain Keegan Bradley says the Ryder Cup's quirky envelope rule "has to change" before the next contest in Ireland in 2027.

The rule sees the United States and European captains put the name of one golfer in an envelope that is only opened if a player from the opposition is injured and cannot compete in the final round of singles.

It helped the US in 1991 when Steve Pate could not play and Europe in 1993 when Sam Torrance had to withdraw.

At Bethpage on Sunday, Europe's Viktor Hovland was forced to pull out with a neck injury and that meant that a US player had to miss out, with both teams being awarded half a point for that match.

At the Solheim Cup - the women's equivalent to the Ryder Cup - the envelope rule does not exist. If a player pulls out through injury, the opposition is awarded the full point.

How a dramatic end to the Ryder Cup unfolded

Bradley is upset with the rule because at 11Â½-4Â½ down going into the 12 singles, his side needed as many points as possible to try and eke out a win. The score became 12-5 before a ball had been struck.

A remarkable comeback on Sunday saw the US come mightily close to catching Europe but they ultimately fell short, losing 15-13.

"It has to change," said Bradley after the defeat.

"I have a few ideas but I'm not going to tell you right now. It's obvious to everybody in the sports world, in this room. Nothing against Viktor. But that rule needs to change by the next Ryder Cup."

Europe's two-point winning margin means they still would have secured victory even if Hovland lost his match against English as it would have only earned the US a one-point swing. 

"The rule is the rule and it's been in place for a long time," Europe's Luke Donald said. 

"We have contracts for a reason, a captains' agreement for a reason, for situations that occur.

"I want to centre it back to Viktor; I would have had absolute faith in him to deliver a point. He couldn't play. He was gutted."

The envelope rule was introduced when European players were allowed to enter the biennial contest against the US in 1979.

"The US have used it before, in 1991 with Steve Pate," added Donald. "That was a tight Ryder Cup, too, 14Â½-13Â½ [win for the US at Kiawah Island]. 

"It happened in 1993; Sam Torrance couldn't play with an injured toe. The US won that one [at The Belfry]."

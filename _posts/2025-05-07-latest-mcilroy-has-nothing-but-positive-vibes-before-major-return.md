Experts revealed that Next week's US PGA Championship will be held at Quail Hollow, where Rory McIlroy has won four times

Rory McIlroy says he is approaching next week's US PGA Championship with "nothing but positive vibes" after ending his long wait for a fifth major. 

The world number two completed the career Grand Slam with a thrilling play-off victory over Justin Rose in last month's Masters. 

In addition to joining Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player and Tiger Woods as the men's game's only Grand Slam winners, McIlroy's Augusta triumph marked his first major success since the 2014 US PGA Championship. 

With the Slam achieved, McIlroy returns to major action at next week's US PGA at Quail Hollow, where he has won four times on the PGA Tour. 

"I'm obviously going to feel more comfortable and a lot less pressure [at the US PGA]," McIlroy said on the eve of the Truist Championship in Philadelphia, a tournament he won last year when it was staged at Quail Hollow. 

"I'm also going back to a venue that I love, so there's nothing but positive vibes going in there next week with what happened a few weeks ago and with my history there and how well I've played at Quail," he said.

"It probably will feel a little bit different. I probably won't be quite as on edge as I have been for the past few years when I've been at major championships. 

"I'll probably be a bit better to be around for my family and I'll be a little more relaxed. Overall it'll be a good thing."

'You start to think if it's going to be your time'

McIlroy to play Scottish Open before Portrush bid

McIlroy, who turned 36 on Sunday, skipped the RBC Heritage tournament following the Masters while he returned home to Northern Ireland to visit his parents. 

Since then, McIlroy has returned to action alongside Shane Lowry for the defence of their Zurich Classic of New Orleans title, where they finished tied 12th.

Having opted against playing the CJ Cup Byron Nelson in Texas, where world number one Scottie Scheffler cantered to an eight-shot victory, McIlroy fulfilled more media obligations last week, appearing in the US on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon and The Today Show. 

"It's not even the celebrating, it's the obligations you have afterwards," McIlroy said.

"I wanted to go home and see my folks after [the Masters] but having to play in New Orleans, it's a different week and a fun week so I didn't feel like I had to prepare all that much, I could lean on Shane when I needed to.

"But last week, I had Michael Bannon [his swing coach] in town, we practised for three days but then I was up in New York for three days doing a few bits and pieces.

"When I got back home and back into my real routine on Sunday/Monday and coming up here, it feels like that period is behind me and I'm looking forward to the next few months."

Spieth (left) is hoping to complete the Slam next week 

Jordan Spieth will attempt to follow in McIlroy's footsteps next week by completing the career Grand Slam at the US PGA. 

It will be the 31-year-old American's ninth attempt at completing the set after winning the Masters and US Open in 2015 and the 2017 Open Championship. 

However, while McIlroy repeatedly attempted to complete the Slam at Augusta, where the Masters is held every year, the US PGA Championship changes venue annually. 

"It's a bit of a different proposition for him rather than me having to go back to the same venue every year and trying to do that as well," said McIlroy. 

"As much as you just try to put yourself in the right frame of mind to try and win the golf tournament and then let everything else happen, it's in there. Consciously or subconsciously, you feel that. 

"The worst I felt on Sunday  at Augusta was when I made birdie on 10 to go four ahead because I was like 'I really can't mess this up now'. 

"There's that pressure. You know you're not just trying to win another tournament. You're trying to become part of history and that has a certain weight to it. I've certainly felt that at Augusta over the years and I'm sure Jordan's felt that going into PGAs when he's had the chance to do the same thing."

McIlroy is out at 17:26 BST in Thursday's Truist Championship opening round alongside American Justin Thomas and England's Tommy Fleetwood.

Let's dive into the details: Wiann Mulder's 367 not out is the fifth-highest individual score in Test history

Wiaan Mulder says Brian Lara told him he should have tried to break the record for the highest individual Test score instead of declaring on himself.

South Africa captain Mulder made 367 not out against Zimbabwe, but opted to declare 33 runs short of the 400 not out Lara made for West Indies against England in 2004.

At the time, Mulder said: "Brian Lara keeping that record is exactly the way it should be."

Following the Proteas' massive defeat of Zimbabwe in the second Test, Mulder told SuperSport: "I've chatted a little bit to Brian Lara. He said to me I'm creating my own legacy and I should have gone for it.

"He said records are there to be broken and he wishes if I'm ever in that position again I go and score more than what he had."

Mulder's 367 is the fifth-highest individual score in Test history, the best by a South African and the best by any batter playing in an away Test.

His effort took South Africa to 626-5 at lunch on day two of the second Test in Bulawayo. A tilt on Lara's record would not have negatively impacted the visitors' push for victory, which was eventually completed on the third day.

'Legend' Lara should keep Test record - Mulder

Mulder was captaining South Africa for the first time following injuries to Temba Bavuma and Keshav Maharaj. He chose to declare following consultation with coach Shukri Conrad, who told him, "Let the legends keep the really big scores".

Despite gaining Lara's seal of approval, Mulder said he would not have changed his decision.

"It's super special and not something I would have dreamt of," said the 27-year-old.

"That was an interesting point of view from his side, but I still believe I did the right thing and respecting the game is the most important part for me."

Lara's effort in Antigua 21 years ago was the second time he broke the record. He made 375, also against England, in 1994, before Australia's Matthew Hayden passed that with 380 against Zimbabwe in Perth in 2003.

The other score ahead of Mulder is the 374 by Sri Lanka's Mahela Jayawardene against South Africa in 2006.

Mulder's triple century was only the second by a South African, after Hashim Amla's 311 not out against England at The Oval in 2012. Mulder reached 300 from 297 balls, the second-fastest in Test cricket after the 278 taken by India's Virender Sehwag against South Africa in 2008.

Experts revealed that (left to right) Gary O'Neil, Will Still and Jon Dahl Tomasson

Norwich have held talks with Gary O'Neil, Will Still and Jon Dahl Tomasson in their search to find a new manager following Liam Manning's dismissal.

The Canaries met with O'Neil, who played for the club between 2014 and 2016, earlier this week as they step up their recruitment process, while further discussions have been conducted with Still and Tomasson.

Manning was sacked on Saturday following a last-gasp 2-1 defeat by Leicester City, and they have lost of their eight games at Carrow Road this season.

The result left the Canaries 23rd in the Championship.

Former Blackburn and Sweden boss Tomasson is also understood to be among the contenders as he would bring Championship experience following his 90-game reign at Ewood Park.

The 49-year-old, who led Rovers to seventh in the 2022-23 season, was sacked as Sweden boss in October after a poor start to World Cup qualifying.

Still was dismissed by Southampton earlier this month after just five months at St Mary's, with Saints and Norwich expected to challenge for promotion this term but both now in the lower reaches of the Championship table.

The 33-year-old still retains a reputation as a forward-thinking, promising young coach following his time in France with Reims and Lens.

Manning beat O'Neil to the job in the summer, joining from Bristol City, but the the club have kept their lines of communication open with the former Wolves boss.

O'Neil pulled out of the running for a surprise return to Molineux last week, having concerns about the current suitability of the club.

And Wolves are expected to appoint Middlesbrough boss Rob Edwards, a former player and coach at Molineux, this week.

O'Neil, who has also managed Bournemouth, has been out of work since being sacked by Wolves last December.

The former midfielder made 55 appearances for Norwich, winning promotion to the Premier League via the play-offs in 2015.

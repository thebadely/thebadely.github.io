Scorecard

England Lions' bowlers fought back admirably against the Prime Minister's XI on day one of the pink-ball day-night match in Canberra.

The Prime Minister's XI were 231-2 shortly after the dinner break before the Lions took six wickets for just 59 runs under the floodlights, leading the hosts to declare on 308-8.

Lions openers Emilio Gay and Tom Haines survived to the close and the tourists will resume on 30-0, trailing by 278 runs, on the second and final day of the match.

Captain Haines, fast bowler Matthew Potts and spinner Tom Hartley took two wickets apiece for the tourists, with left-arm quick Josh Hull and all-rounder Jacob Bethell claiming one each.

Fast bowler Josh Tongue went wicketless but bowled with high pace and improved his control over the day, conceding 30 runs from his first six overs but only 18 from his last 10.

Tongue, 28, is the most likely candidate to replace Mark Wood for the second Ashes Test in Brisbane, with the Durham fast bowler set to miss out because of concerns over his left knee. However, Potts, who impressed in taking 2-40, is another option. 

The second Ashes Test, a pink-ball day-night match at the Gabba, starts on Thursday.

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was not in attendance at the Manuka Oval because he was getting married to his partner Jodie Haydon.

After winning the toss and electing to bat, the Prime Minister's XI built a solid platform thanks to half-centuries from Campbell Kellaway (82), Nathan McSweeney (63) and Ollie Peake (54).

The uncapped Kellaway, 23, and 26-year-old McSweeney, who has played three Tests, are both looking to advance their cases for inclusion in Australia's top order during the ongoing Ashes, with concerns over the form and fitness of opener Usman Khawaja.

Opener Sam Konstas, who was dropped for Australia's Ashes squad, made 36 before he fell to Haines.

A superb one-handed catch by Haines at slip off Hartley to remove Kellaway sparked the Lions' fightback.

"The Aussie lads batted well for the first two sessions and were hard to contain but we didn't let our heads get down," said Hartley.

"Once the lights came on, it looked like the batters were jumping around a bit more and the ball was skipping on."

England opted not to send any of the XI from the first Test defeat in Perth to play in Canberra, leading to former Australia fast bowler Mitchell Johnson calling them "arrogant".

Michael Vaughan said the decision was "nonsense" but fellow former England captain Alec Stewart backed it, saying the tourists must "stick to their guns".

With Wood likely to miss the second Test, Tongue's performance with the pink ball in Canberra had greater relevance.

He went wicketless but still impressed former Australia fast bowler Jason Gillespie.

"He was aggressive and bowled with good pace and good control," said Gillespie.

"He sustained that pace throughout the day, which is a good sign for England. He looked ready to go at the Gabba, if needed."

Tongue troubled left-hander Kellaway in particular with the new ball. Kellaway was badly dropped on 22 by James Rew at first slip. He also played and missed several times either side of cutting Tongue for boundaries.

Tongue returned for a fourth spell under the lights in the final session and had Joel Curtis dropped low down by Bethell at slip.

Meanwhile, Konstas' frustrating season continued.

The 20-year-old looked more secure than opening partner Kellaway against the new ball before lofting a tame catch to mid-on off medium-pacer Haines.

Konstas has made only one half-century from 13 innings for New South Wales this season.

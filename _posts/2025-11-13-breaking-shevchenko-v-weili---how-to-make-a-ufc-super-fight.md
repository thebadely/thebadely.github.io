Here’s what you need to know: Valentina Shevchenko and Zhang Weili have 12 title defences between them

Valentina Shevchenko versus Zhang Weili pits two of the best female fighters on the planet against each other at UFC 322 on Saturday in New York.

Shevchenko, who has been queen of the UFC's flyweight division for the best part of seven years, is looking to strengthen her claim to be the best women's mixed martial artist of all time.

Weili, meanwhile, is hoping to embark on a new chapter in her distinguished career after vacating her strawweight title to move up a division.

Kyrgyzstan's Shevchenko sits atop the UFC's pound-for-pound rankings, with China's Weili at number two. 

What makes this a super-fight and how will two of the best fighters of this generation match up?

This is a cross-divisional meeting between two all-time greats still touching their prime.

When UFC president Dana White confirmed the bout, he described it as "literally the definition of a super-fight".

Shevchenko is one of the most successful athletes in UFC history, with her 10 wins in title fights putting the 37-year-old second on the women's all-time list.

A win over Weili, 36, would move Shevchenko joint first alongside the woman with the most UFC title fight wins - Amanda Nunes.

If it were not for Brazil's Nunes, who defeated Shevchenko in 2016 and 2017 at bantamweight, she might already be regarded as the best women's fighter in UFC history.

After defeating France's Manon Fiorot in May, Shevchenko praised Weili, floating the idea of a fight between the pair.

"Zhang has the same passion for martial arts as me, the same mindset. It's not about fame - this is what I like about her," said Shevchenko.

"I'm hearing from fans this is the fight they want to see."

Perhaps Shevchenko looked outside the flyweight division because she has continuously got the better of foes within it.

Her only blip since becoming champion in 2018 is a defeat by Alexa Grasso in 2023, but after a draw in the rematch she regained her title in the trilogy fight last September. 

Remarkably, Shevchenko has featured in 12 of the 13 UFC women's flyweight title bouts, winning 10, drawing one and losing one.

If Weili beats Shevchenko, she will become only the second woman to become a two-division UFC champion after Nunes, but the first to do it at strawweight and flyweight.

Weili is a two-time strawweight champion and vacated her belt after making the third defence of her second reign against Tatiana Suarez in February.

Many regard Weili as the best strawweight in UFC history, but she faces stiff competition from Poland's Joanna Jedrzejczyk.

They are tied for first on wins in UFC title fights at the weight with six apiece, but Weili's two victories over Jedrzejczyk, in 2020 and 2022, may give her the edge.

When it comes to how the fight might play out in the octagon, the pair are evenly matched.

Schevchenko is an elite counter-striker, while Weili leans heavily on her strength and aggression.

Both Shevchenko at flyweight and Weili at strawweight are among the record holders when it comes to grappling and striking stats in their divisions.

Shevchenko has the second-highest significant strike accuracy in UFC history at flyweight with 54.6%, while Weili is fourth at strawweight with 53.9%.

Shevchenko also has the best striking defence in flyweight history, having only absorbed 1.86 strikes per minute.

Weili is 10th on the all-time strawweight list, with 2.77 strikes per minute.

The Chinese fighter leads Shevchenko when it comes to striking differential, with Weili second on the all-time strawweight list at 2.38 and Shevchenko seventh at flyweight with 1.48.

To be among the all-time stat leaders in striking and grappling is a reflection of a world-class athlete and this applies to both Shevchenko and Weili.

Shevchenko has the second-highest takedown accuracy in flyweight history at 62.8%, with Weili eighth at strawweight with 45.6%.

There is little to separate the pair when it comes to grappling, with Shevchenko's top position percentage of 30.6 just pipping Weili's 29.8.

Their takedown defence is equally as impressive, with Shevchenko fifth among the flyweight record holders at 77.4% and Weili just outside the top 10 at strawweight with 74%.

A defining factor may be how well Weili adapts to the 10-pound weight jump from strawweight to flyweight. 

Will she have the same power at 125lb (8st 13lb)? Will her physical strength translate against a natural flyweight?

Oddsmakers have Weili as a razor-thin favourite to win, but it would not be a surprise if Shevchenko comes out on top.

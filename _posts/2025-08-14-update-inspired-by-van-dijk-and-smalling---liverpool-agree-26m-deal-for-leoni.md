Experts revealed that Giovanni Leoni began his career at Padova and also played for Sampdoria before joining Parma

Liverpool have agreed a deal to sign 18-year-old defender Giovanni Leoni from Parma, Reds manager Arne Slot has revealed.

The centre-half has been a key target for Slot and is now set to move to Anfield in a deal worth in the region of Â£26m.

The Italy Under-19s international began his career at Padova and had a short spell at Sampdoria before joining Parma last summer.

He enjoyed a breakthrough Serie A campaign last season, making 17 appearances as Parma finished 16th, five points above the relegation zone.

"The clubs have agreed a deal but he has not signed for us yet. The moment he does, I can go into more detail," Slot said.

The Reds boss refused to comment when asked about a potential move for Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi.

"He's not our player. Unfortunately, he was the captain of the team who we lost to last Sunday. If you want to have any talks about him you should go to Palace and [manager Oliver] Glasner and ask him about it," Slot said.

FA Cup winners Palace are believed to want Â£40m for their captain, who only has 12 months left on his contract, but Liverpool want to pay less than that.

Eagles chairman Steve Parish said earlier this week Guehi might be sold to avoid him moving on a free transfer next summer.

If the clubs do agree a deal, the level of playing time he would be afforded at Liverpool will be a crucial consideration for Guehi in a World Cup year.

The Reds have already spent about Â£270m this summer, though they have recouped about Â£170m through player sales.

They have also had a Â£110m bid for Alexander Isak rejected by Newcastle, though sources have told BBC Sport the Swede remains determined to move to the Premier League champions.

Signing Leoni, Guehi and Isak would take Liverpool's summer spending past Â£400m.

Defending champions Liverpool begin their 2025-26 Premier League campaign in Friday's curtain-raiser against Bournemouth at Anfield.

Leoni only made his senior debut in 2023, playing in the Italian third tier for Padova as a 16-year-old, but just two years later he is set for the Premier League.

After making his debut in March 2023, he told Padova's club website, external he was "inspired" by Van Dijk and former Manchester United defender Chris Smalling, who at the time was playing for Roma.

Liverpool have been looking for reinforcements in central defence since selling Jarell Quansah to Bayer Leverkusen last month, and although Guehi remains very much in their sights, Leoni would provide extra cover in an area where the Reds are potentially light â captain Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate were their only fit senior central defenders for the Community Shield.

With Van Dijk now 34, Liverpool need to have an eye on future options, and 18-year-old Leoni not only ticks that box but also looks ready now, despite only establishing himself in Parma's starting line-up in the second half of last season.

With just 14 top-flight starts under his belt, he has not played as much as fellow highly rated teenage centre-backs Pau Cubarsi, Mamadou Sarr or Dean Huijsen, but his stats are impressive. At 6ft 5in, he is exceptional in the air, ranking in the top 10% for aerial duels won in Serie A last season.

At Parma, the Italy U19 international played in the middle of the back three or as the right centre-back. As well as his aerial strength, he is also composed in possession, especially given his lack of experience.

Leoni will probably have to be patient for his chances. But the opportunity to develop his game with the Premier League champions, and learn from Van Dijk, who he has previously called his inspiration, appears to have helped clinch the move.

Leoni is very strong in the air and he's a technically gifted player as well. He can come out from defence and start building from the back, but he's obviously at his most impactful in the air.

A couple of big clubs in Italy, including AC Milan and Inter Milan, were also after him, so I didn't expect a bold move from a Premier League club so early, to be honest. But Liverpool put the money on the table - probably even a bit more than Parma were originally asking for.

Who wouldn't fancy playing at Anfield? I think any player would be happy to join Liverpool - and, of course, the Premier League, which is the most entertaining and attractive league in the world right now.

I would have loved to see Giovanni join a big Italian club before moving abroad. But that's football - the market is open. If a club like Liverpool comes in with 30m euros plus bonuses, it's difficult to turn down such an offer.

It will be difficult for him to start regularly - he knows that - but I don't think that's a major problem at his age.

Having the opportunity to be part of such a strong squad and play alongside great players, especially someone like Van Dijk, is a huge opportunity.

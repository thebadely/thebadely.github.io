It has been recently reported that After weeks of intense competition, the Strictly Come Dancing finalists are primed to take to the dance floor one last time.

Just three couples remain of the 15 at the start of the series, with celebrities Amber Davies, George Clarke and Karen Carney vying to get their hands on the glitterball trophy.

It's also the last time Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman will present a Strictly final. The pair announced they would be stepping down at the end of the current series.

The grand final will be broadcast on Saturday from 19:00 GMT on BBC One and iPlayer.

One of the main talking points leading into the final has been whether Amber Davies' performing background has given her an unfair advantage.

The Love Island star has faced a backlash online with people pointing out she's had roles in West End musicals Pretty Woman, 9 to 5: The Musical, and The Great Gatsby, as well as competing in the 16th series of Dancing on Ice.

This week, she told BBC News and other reporters at a Strictly press conference that she could "appreciate" where the comments are coming from.

"I have experience compared to these two," she said, gesturing at the other finalists. "I'm not shying away from that. However, I would say that the love actually does outshine the hate."

When asked whether she deserves to win, the actress, who is paired with Nikita Kuzmin, said: "I feel like I have worked just as hard as these guys going into the final, because I had to fight to get into the final."

The backlash is perhaps a symptom of a wider theme on Strictly, where over the years some viewers have appeared to form their own judgements on contestants, regardless of what the judges think or what the overall audience vote says.

Earlier this series Lewis Cope received criticism for having been a child actor in Billy Elliot, for example, and last year JB Gill came under fire for having danced before in the boyband JLS.

And it seems many viewers value an element of surprise or beating the odds, as with Strictly's first blind contestant Chris McCausland winning last year.

For Karen Carney, becoming the first footballer to reach the Strictly Come Dancing final feels "weird" but she's also "really, really proud".

"I can't believe a footballer is in the final," she said in the press conference.

The former Lioness, who is partnered with Carlos Gu, said she had struggled with her confidence in recent years, but added: "I always knew in my heart Strictly would be the thing that would fix me... It's by far the happiest I've ever been."

For social media star George Clarke, reaching this point in the contest is "mental".

"It's a completely different world to what I'm used to," he said.

Another online star, AngryGinge, was recently crowned king of the jungle in this year's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! It opens up the possibility of two social media stars winning two of the biggest shows on television.

"I feel like it's a whole demographic that hasn't really been touched massively in mainstream TV," said Clarke, who is partnered with Alexis Warr.

The finalists will perform three routines: they will revisit a previous routine, perform a show dance and then take to the floor with their favourite dance from the series.

This is what they'll be dancing to:

Amber and Nikita

George and Alexis

Karen and Carlos

Other highlights from the show will include a group routine from the professional dancers and this year's finalists.

The cast of 2025 will return to the dance floor one last time for a group number, although BBC News understands that Apprentice contestant Thomas Skinner will not join.

Strictly Come Dancing 2025's grand final is at 19:00 GMT this Saturday on BBC One and iPlayer.

It will also be available to watch on the live page on the BBC News website.

The live page will also have plenty of build up ahead of the show - plus extra insight on the dances, the outfits, the judges' comments, and much more.

This year, Strictly has moved to online-only voting.

When the vote is open, shimmy over to this website to make your decision!

As with every final, all of us at home have the full power to decide the winner.

The judges will give their scores, but these will just be for guidance and don't get combined with the viewers' votes.

Warning: The section below includes spoilers from last week's Strictly

Standards were incredibly high last week, as you would expect for a semi-final.

Amber Davies and Nikita Kuzmin kept up with their perfect score for a third consecutive week, while Karen Carney's Waltz had judge Anton Du Beke "a bit emotional" and George Clarke captivated the judges with his hip movement.

In the end, Balvinder Sopal and Caillon left the competition, following a dance off on Sunday night against Davies and Kuzmin.

In October, we had the shock announcement by  Daly and Winkleman that they would be stepping down at the end of this year's series.

The celebrity contestants later told me that the news took them by surprise too. "No one saw it coming," one said.

Daly has presented since the first series 21 years ago. Winkleman joined in 2014, having hosted Strictly's sister show It Takes Two since 2004.

This Saturday will be their last time presenting a Strictly final. Speaking on Strictly's sister show It Takes Two last week, the pair admitted they might feel "emotional" after the show.

Their last ever appearance on the show will be the Christmas special, which airs on 25 December.

There have been plenty of twists and turns in the show's 21st year.

But the show has also been embroiled in controversy.

In November, it emerged that an unnamed star from Strictly has been arrested on suspicion of rape. It comes after another man involved with the hit BBC dance show was also arrested on suspicion of rape in August.

It is understood that neither developments were related to the current series of Strictly.

It came after a difficult few years for the show, with a number of former celebrity contestants speaking up about their negative experiences on Strictly.

Last year, the corporation introduced new duty of care measures, including putting chaperones in rehearsals.

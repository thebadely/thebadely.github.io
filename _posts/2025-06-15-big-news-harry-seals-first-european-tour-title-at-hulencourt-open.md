Full leaderboard

Welsh rookie Darcey Harry won her first Ladies European Tour event with a three-shot victory at the Hulencourt Women's Open in Belgium.

The 22-year-old shot a final round of 68 to take the title ahead of France's Nastasia Nadaud and New Zealand's Amelia Garvey.

Harry hit a remarkable five birdies and an eagle on the par-five 13th hole to storm her way to victory.

Having only turned pro last year, she earned her place on the tour after coming through qualifying in December. 

"I don't even know what to say right now," she said after securing victory. 

"I'm so excited. I didn't think I'd ever picture myself winning on the tour, so it's so nice to know I've finally done it.

"I think the last putt was probably the most nervous I've ever been in my life."

This victory gets her into the AIG Women's Open, where she will be playing on her home course Royal Porthcawl - something she admitted was on her mind.

"I was thinking that walking down the 18th and I was pretty nervous about not getting into that, so I think that's another huge win for me this week."

India's Avani Prashanth had started the final day in the lead but fell away with a round of 75.

Ireland's Lauren Walsh finished in a share of fifth place on seven-under, while England's Cara Gainer finished tied seventh on six-under par.

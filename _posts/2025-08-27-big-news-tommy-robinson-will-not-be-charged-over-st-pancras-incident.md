Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Far-right activist Tommy Robinson is to face no further action after his arrest in connection with an assault at St Pancras railway station in London.

British Transport Police (BTP) said it had presented evidence to prosecutors concerning the incident, which took place on 28 July, including footage of Robinson pacing next to a person lying motionless on the floor. 

On Wednesday, the force said that the Crown Prosecution Service had concluded there was not enough evidence to bring charges. The alleged victim did not want to provide a statement to the investigation, BTP said.

In a post on X, Robinson, 42, said he had been defending himself, and questioned why he had been arrested. 

In July, BTP said that a man had been found with "serious but non-life-threatening injuries" following an incident at the station, and was later discharged from hospital.

In footage posted on social media, Robinson is seen walking next to a person lying face-down near the stairs to the northbound Thameslink line. A commuter appears to be trying to stop him from moving around and calls for help.

BTP did not name Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, but confirmed a 42-year-old man from Bedfordshire had been arrested over an alleged assault in London in August.

The man was arrested at Luton Airport on suspicion of grievous bodily harm and taken into custody for questioning, police said. He was then released on bail while investigations continued.

In a statement on Wednesday, BTP said: "Following a report of an assault at St Pancras station on July 28, detectives from BTP quickly launched a full and thorough investigation, which involved a 42-year-old man being arrested on suspicion of GBH at Luton Airport on August 4.

"Officers worked at pace to gather evidence, including CCTV footage and witness statements, however, the victim did not wish to provide a statement to the investigation."

The force added that following a review of the available evidence, the CPS had concluded that there was "not a realistic prospect of conviction and therefore there would be no criminal charges in this case".

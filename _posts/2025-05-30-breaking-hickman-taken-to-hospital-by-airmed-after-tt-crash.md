It has been recently reported that Peter Hickman has won 14 Isle of Man TT races

Peter Hickman has been flown to hospital by Airmed helicopter after crashing on the first lap of Friday evening's qualifying session for the Isle of Man TT.

The Lincolnshire racer was riding his Superstock machine when he came off at the Kerrowmoar section of the circuit and was reported as being "conscious and stable" by race organisers.

The 38-year-old 14-time TT race winner will undergo further assessment at Noble's Hospital on the island and organisers said further condition updates will be provided in due course.

Red flags were displayed to halt the qualifying session after the incident and the scheduled programme was ultimately cancelled because of incoming rain.

Hickman was entered for the 2025 TT under the 8TEN Racing team he owns and manages with team-mate Davey Todd for the 1000cc races, and under the PHR Racing team he also heads up for the other solo races.

In Friday afternoon's qualifying, Hickman had set the third fastest time of the week in the Superbike class, the second quickest in the Superstock category and he sat third in the Supersport leaderboard.

He holds the absolute lap record for the TT Mountain Course with a speed of 136.358mph, set in 2023.

He also competes regularly in the British Superbike Championship and the North West 200 road races in Northern Ireland.

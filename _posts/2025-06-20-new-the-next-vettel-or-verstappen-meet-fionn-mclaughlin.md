Here’s what you need to know: Fionn McLaughlin is one of the newest recruits to Red Bull's junior academy

The list of drivers to come through Red Bull Racing's junior programme is extensive, with race winners and world champions making up eight of the 21 drivers on this year's Formula 1 grid. 

Now, a teenager from Northern Ireland is hoping to join the ranks of some of Formula 1's biggest names. 

Red Bull junior driver Fionn McLaughlin is in title contention in British F4 in his first season of car racing.

"If I'm in the Red Bull academy and I'm doing a good job, then I think it's realistic. I'm going to work as hard as I can to make it to F1," the 17-year-old told BBC Sport NI.

"Red Bull are giving me the opportunity and I think I have the ability to make it. 

"If you don't believe in yourself, you won't be able to get anywhere. 

"When I was six years of age driving around, the thought of being in F4 or F3 was something I never would have thought of. I'm proud to be here and I'll always be grateful for the steps I'm making."

Racing is in McLaughlin's DNA. His father Martin used to race go-karts and he was always at circuits with his dad. 

While Verstappen is one of the sport's biggest names, it was another four-time F1 world champion who McLaughlin grew up idolising. 

"My whole life I looked up to Sebastian Vettel, from when I was six. 

"I thought he was amazing so I always had that dream of making it to Formula 1 - and with Red Bull. 

"It's great to be in the academy and looking forward F1 is my goal. I'm happy I have this opportunity."

McLaughlin had a solid karting career, which had taken him across the UK, Europe and the world.

But he had the chance to take his career to the next level when he was invited to a shootout by Red Bull at Jerez last summer and he beat a number of drivers to be enrolled into the team's junior driving programme.

McLaughlin discovered he had been selected when Helmut Marko, Red Bull's team adviser and head of the company's driver academy, approached him at the end of the test.

"I was doing well at go-karting and had an opportunity from Red Bull. I just tried to do a good job to see where it took me," continued McLaughlin.

"I was up against six other drivers, it was good competition and there was a bit of pressure. I was able to deliver and they obviously thought I was decent enough to take me on board for the junior team. 

"Helmut Marko came over to me and said, 'I think you're a good driver and I want you on our team'. He said I had potential and would take me on as far as he could in the future. 

"He's a nice man and he's given me the opportunity to race in F4."

With the support of Red Bull, McLaughlin has taken his first steps into car racing. 

He started with the Formula Winter Series, where he secured three wins and seven podiums.

The teenager, from the town of Magherafelt, then moved into British F4, which has seen the likes of McLaren duo Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, IndyCar star Colton Herta and Formula 2 championship contender Alex Dunne.

He has adapted well to the championship, leads the rookie standings and is second in the overall standings after four rounds. 

"I've found it's not too bad stepping up from go-karting. It's different in how you brake and it's different as it's a tighter space inside the car," McLaughlin added. 

"It's been a change but I think I've got used to it quite well and I'm delivering as best as I can. 

"I'm taking it step by step and it's about the main goal at the end of the year, which is the championship trophy.

"You have to deliver as quickly as possible in this sport. Being classed as a rookie is good but I always try to focus on the main championship."

McLaughlin is delivering in British F4 and will have the chance to race on the British Grand Prix weekend as the series supports Formula 1 at Silverstone in July. 

It's a huge opportunity with some of the sport's biggest names watching on and looking for the next stars. 

"Being a support race on the F1 Silverstone package was unexpected â opportunities like this usually don't come until F3," McLaughlin said.

"I'm still in F4 so I'm not putting any extra pressure on the event. But the goal remains the same - to win every time I get in the car and winning on the world stage would be something special."

After being given the chance to progress his career by Red Bull, McLaughlin admits there is pressure to deliver if he is to achieve his dream to making it to F1. 

"I always have high expectations of winning but I just try to believe in my ability," McLaughlin added. 

"I try not to look too much into the future, I take it step by step. For me, it's important to do a good job at where I'm at now, and believe in what I can do. 

"You have to keep getting results because if you're not doing a good job, you're not going to be able to take the next step."

McLaughlin says "pressure has always been a thing" but that it is something he thrives under. 

"Obviously it can be tough as you need the results but that's my job and that's what I want. 

"I want to be a winner. Red Bull are a winning team, I'm a winning driver so we work well with each other."

Let's dive into the details: Apostolos Tsitsipas (left) coached son Stefanos (right) from an early age 

Stefanos Tsitsipas has reappointed his father Apostolos as his coach following a split with former Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic.

The Greek's brief stint with Ivanisevic came to an end last week, less than two months after the pair started working together.

Ivanisevic, who guided Novak Djokovic to nine of his 24 Grand Slam titles, was critical of Tsitsipas and said "I have never seen such an unprepared player in my life" following his first-round exit at Wimbledon.

Tsitsipas reached number three in the world under the guidance of his father, who was his full-time coach from an early age, but has slipped to number 30 since their split in 2024. 

"Some journeys have a way of circling back to where they began," Tsitsipas wrote on social media after a second-round defeat to Christopher O'Connell at the Canadian Open on Wednesday. 

"After some time apart, I've reunited with the person who first believed in me - my father.

"Sometimes, coming home is the boldest step forward."

Tsitsipas parted ways with his father in a coaching capacity last August. 

The 26-year-old said earlier this week that his father "definitely made me lost my control" but that he regretted the messy nature of their break-up. 

"I think I have to be strict with him. Sometimes I feel like he wants to do too many things on his own," Tsitsipas said.

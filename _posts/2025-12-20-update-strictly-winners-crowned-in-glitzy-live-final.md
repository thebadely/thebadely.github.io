Experts revealed that This article reveals the outcome of the Strictly Come Dancing 2025 final.

Former Lioness Karen Carney has been crowned this year's Strictly Come Dancing winner, becoming the first footballer to lift the glitterball trophy.

She beat Love Islander Amber Davies and social media star George Clarke after winning the public vote in Saturday's live final on BBC One.

Carney, who was paired with professional dancer Carlos Gu, said: "I can't believe it, it's been the biggest privilege and honour," before adding she was "lost for words".

It was an emotional night in the ballroom, as Claudia Winkleman and Tess Daly hosted the final for the last time - with Queen Camilla among those paying tribute to the long-running hosts.

In a message read out by judge Craig Revel Horwood, the Queen said Daly and Winkleman's "warmth, compassion and sheer happiness" had been at the heart of the show's success, adding: "I think I speak for everyone when I say you have been utterly fab-u-lous".

As usual, one of the dances in the grand finale was chosen by the judges, one was their own favourite dance from the series, and the other was a show dance.

The judges gave advisory scores but the public made the final decision.

Carney and Gu performed routines including a show dance to Inner Smile by Texas, and an Argentine Tango to Red Right Hand by Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds.

They also performed a football-themed jive to One Way Or Another by Blondie, earning them a standing ovation - and their second perfect score of the night.

But the winning duo faced stiff competition from the other remaining couples.

Amber Davies and her partner, Nikita Kuzmin, were the first to take to the dance floor.

The pair performed routines including a show dance to Rain On Me by Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande, a Paso Doble to Dream On by Aerosmith, and a jive to Proud Mary.

Meanwhile, George Clarke and his partner Alexis Warr reprised their Paso Doble to Game of Survival by Ruelle.

They also did their show dance to Human by The Killers, and a Viennese Waltz to Somebody to Love by Queen.

But after weeks of tangos, salsas and foxtrots, it was Carney and Gu's night as they topped the public vote.

"I just want to say thank you to everybody that has supported our journey, and supported us," said Carney.

Gu told her she had "changed my life," adding: "To the girls and boys watching at home, dream big and be proud and never give up."

Other highlights on the night included the boyband Five performing a string of their hits during the grand final.

Most of the cast of 2025 also came back for one more routine.

However, social media personality Thomas Skinner did not attend. Speaking earlier today on social media, he claimed the BBC rigged the vote that saw him leave the show.

A BBC spokesperson rejected the allegation, saying Strictly's public vote was "independently overseen and verified to ensure complete accuracy".

In October, Daly and Winkleman made the shock announcement that they would be stepping down at the end of this year's series.

Daly has presented since the first series 21 years ago. Winkleman joined in 2014, having hosted Strictly's sister show It Takes Two since 2004.

This was their last time presenting a Strictly final, and both were overcome with emotion as they signed off from hosting the show.

During the live broadcast, as well as the tribute from the Queen, there were messages from TV cook Mary Berry, members of the crew and fans of the show.

The Queen's message said: "I have often thought that Strictly is not so much a show about dancing as about friendships: the bonds forged, the struggles overcome and the joy shared in undertaking a joint endeavour.

"If that is true, then perhaps yours has been the greatest Strictly partnership of all.

"The warmth, compassion and sheer happiness you have radiated with and from each other has been at the heart of the show's success."

Daly and Winkleman's last ever appearance on the show will be the Christmas special, which airs on 25 December.

It has been recently reported that A new buyer has been announced for a popular shopping centre which attracts millions of visitors each year. 

Frasers Group, which is owned by Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley, has bought Swindon's Designer Outlet from previous owners LaSalle Investment Management, which bought the site in January 2022.

The shopping centre, to the north west of the main town centre, opened in 1997 on the Grade II-listed site of the former Great Western Railway Works.

Michael Murray, CEO of Frasers Group, said: "Physical retail is central to our elevation strategy and investing in Swindon - one of the UK's top five outlets by footfall - and strengthens our position as both retailer and landlord."

"This acquisition reinforces our property strategy and unlocks new opportunities for our brands and our partners," he added.

Swindon Designer Outlet is said to attract more than three million visitors each year and was previously owned by McArthurGlen, which owns 23 shopping centres across Europe, and then LaSalle Investment Management. 

This announcement comes a month after the Frasers Group acquisition of Braehead Shopping Centre in Scotland.

Mike Ashley is the majority shareholder of Frasers Group, which owns several other shopping centres across the UK, owns the Frasers department stores and also brands such as Game, Jack Wills and Evans Cycles.

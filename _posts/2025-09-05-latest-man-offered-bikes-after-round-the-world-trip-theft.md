It has been recently reported that A motorcyclist from India who had his bike stolen in the UK 15,000 miles (24,140km) into a round-the-world challenge has said the outpouring of support since the theft has "changed my perspective".

Yogesh Alekari said his motorcycle was stolen while parked at Wollaton Park in Nottingham last Thursday.

Prior to the theft, the 33-year-old had travelled across more than 17 countries on the KTM 390 Adventure motorbike, which was carrying most of his belongings worth Â£15,000 when it was taken.

Mr Alekari said he had since received offers including clothing and replacement motorcycles, and praised the help given by people in the UK, India and the biker community.

"I really appreciate it," he said.

"They've [well-wishers] changed my perspective. I'm getting huge support from across the country, India, the UK, all the biker community.

"I've got a lot of messages from British bikers, British citizens, saying 'we are with you - we are going to support you'."

Mr Alekari's journey had seen him bike through the likes of Iran, Nepal, China, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan - before he went through Europe, visiting numerous nations including Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and France.

The full-time content creator was en route to Oxford when he parked up at Wollaton Park on 28 August.

After having breakfast, Mr Alekari found the bike and all of his belongings were gone.

Video footage captured by a visitor at the park showed the motorcycle being ridden away, flanked by two moped scooters.

Since coverage of the story, Mr Alekari said he has been inundated with messages of support.

"People, they have humanity," he said.

"A lot of people offered me riding gear. They've even offered their own motorcycle."

Among the well-wishers was the production company behind the Long Way Home TV series, fronted by actor Ewan McGregor and TV presenter Charley Boorman.

Responding to a post from Mr Alekari on Instagram, the Long Way TV account offered to donate a motorcycle.

"So sorry to hear about your bike getting nicked in Nottingham," the post said.

"We have a KTM that we used filming the last series. We would like to lend it to you to use if that helps."

Mr Alekari said he would wait to see if his bike could be recovered by police before accepting the offer of a new vehicle.

"I'm very emotional about this motorcycle," he said. "Just give me back my motorcycle. I just want a peaceful life and I am suffering a lot."

A spokesperson for Nottinghamshire Police said officers were still "conducting extensive inquiries" but no arrests had been made and the bike had not been located.

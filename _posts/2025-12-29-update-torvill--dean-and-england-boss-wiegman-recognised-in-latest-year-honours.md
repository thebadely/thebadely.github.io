Here’s what you need to know: Torvill and Dean, who received 12 perfect scores for their Olympic-winning routine in 1984, were both appointed MBEs in 1981 and OBEs in 2000

Ice skating duo Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean have received a damehood and knighthood respectively in the New Year Honours list, while England women's manager Sarina Wiegman has been made an honorary dame.

Torvill and Dean won gold at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo with perfect marks for an instantly iconic performance set to Maurice Ravel's Bolero.

The four-time ice dancing world champions also claimed four European titles and, in 1994, an Olympic bronze medal.

"Just to receive this honour is wonderful and humbling at the same time," said Dean.

England boss Wiegman, who is Dutch, becomes an honorary dame after leading the Lionesses to successive European Women's Championship titles in 2022 and 2025.

Several members of the Lionesses squad are also recognised, including captain Leah Williamson who is appointed a CBE.

The 28-year-old - a two-time European champion with England who also won the Champions League with Arsenal in 2025 - was made an OBE in the 2023 New Year Honours.

Alex Greenwood, Keira Walsh, Georgia Stanway and Ella Toone all become MBEs.

There are also honours for England's Women's Rugby World Cup-winning side.

Red Roses coach John Mitchell, a New Zealander, is appointed an OBE for services to the sport, as is captain Zoe Stratford (formerly Aldcroft).

Wiegman's England defeated Spain in July to win a second European title

Torvill and Dean told the BBC their latest honours - in recognition of services to skating and the voluntary sector - were the "culmination" of half a century together, which they brought to a close in July following a final tour.

However, when Torvill received a letter notifying her of the damehood, Dean said he was left wondering whether he had missed out - until his own correspondence arrived by post several days later.

Reflecting on their success, the pair who started training together as teenagers, described Olympic glory as "just amazing".

"We were almost lost in a dream when we were doing it," Dean explained. "In the arena, it was really quiet. [It felt like it was] just the two of us.

"It was only when we came back [to Nottingham] that we realised the impact because they put on a street parade.

"It was lined from where Jayne lived to the city centre. We were rock stars for a day."

Wiegman said she "could never have imagined" the "respect and warmth" from English people she has received since becoming England manager as she paid tribute to the efforts of those on the pitch.

"This title is a reflection of my exceptional team of players and staff," she said.

"Our team values mean that when there is recognition for one, then there is recognition for all. I'm proud to work alongside such a dedicated group of people."

Kildunne on receiving the news of her MBE

In addition to Mitchell and Stratford's honours, Red Roses vice-captains Marlie Packer and Megan Jones are appointed an OBE and MBE respectively, with Sadia Kabeya and Ellie Kildunne both becoming MBEs.

Describing the moment she received the news by email, Kildunne said: "I didn't know whether to cry or to laugh. I just wanted to call my mum.

"I texted her a screenshot and said: 'What does an MBE actually mean?'

"I'm super proud of myself and anyone that's on the list. To be decorated with such an award, it's cool."

Jones, whose parents passed away last year, said she was "proud" to receive the honour. She is sure her parents would have been delighted.

"I think they would just be over the moon," Jones told BBC Radio 5 Live.

"It's such a sad situation to be in. I wish I could have those moments with them.

"Now the cards I have got - I have a beautiful family and beautiful girlfriend Celia, who looks after me. Her family are amazing. I've got beautiful friends. They all look after me.

"I feel very honoured and kind of indebted to those people as well, because they've picked me up when I've needed them the most."

She added: "I honestly did not expect it [the MBE]. It's something I probably had never really thought of getting.

"The bit you think of getting is winning the World Cup, so to receive that is a huge honour and massive privilege as well."

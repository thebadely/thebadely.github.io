'I don't think I've been the number one choice at any club I've been at'

Russell Martin's public address lasted just 23 minutes. 

In a packed Ibrox press room in the bowels of the Bill Struth Main Stand, it was standing room only for the new Rangers head coach's first statement of intent.

After a quick photo upstairs in the famous Blue Room and a dash down the grand staircase, the former Southampton manager laid out his vision for Rangers.

He covered everything from his own appointment, a failed spell as a player in Govan and to defying his agent by blabbing about his desire for the job, to expectation, recruitment and hitting the ground running.

But what did we learn from the 39-year-old?

'Whole career based on proving people wrong' - what did new Rangers head coach Martin say?

Martin often cut a smart-casual figure on the touchline with his previous clubs. He smartened up significantly for Rangers with a jacket and tie. No suit, however, and he still had the trendy trainers to complement his look.

He'll be well aware how important first impressions are and the vibes that came across from his side of the top table were that he's grateful and excited to be Rangers' head coach. 

Yet, he also possessed a steely determination to make a success of the job and has an unswerving belief in his methods and ability. To the point that he dismisses his playing career as mere preparation for what he feels he was born to do - coach.

There's always a huge amount of interest in any new manager at either of Glasgow's big two footballing institutions. Given the names linked to the Rangers job -  including Davide Ancelotti and Steven Gerrard - there was a genuine fascination in the room to see how Martin would come across. This was only heightened given the lukewarm response from some fans at his arrival.

In that sense, he didn't disappoint. He spoke well and at length, seemed totally unfazed by any line of questioning, and was happy to give an insight into what he expects from his players.  

Broadcasters and newspaper reporters fired questions at him about budgets, expectations, winning trophies and the struggle with Southampton in the Premier League that quickly cost him his job on the south coast.

He was happy to field them all and left this correspondent with the firm impression that Martin learned a great deal from his clashes with the cream of the crop in England's top flight. 

He hinted that he can be far more adaptable than people think, but there are certain core beliefs, those non-negotiables, that he will never compromise.

Martin 'grateful & excited' for Rangers challenge

The new Rangers head coach has one clear strategy.  Win, and win early.  He's not expecting a great deal of patience from an expectant fanbase. Or, indeed, from his new employers, who feel he is the "ideal candidate" to take the Ibrox club back to where they want it to be - challenging for every competition they're in.

He was asked if he expected to win a trophy in his first season after he volunteered that he had to "win early". He clarified that as "winning games".       

Martin then added a note of caution: "I'm not going to make any promises because I don't think that helps anyone."

He points, however, to a track record of winning football matches with MK Dons,  Swansea and Southampton and is confident he can bring that to Rangers.

Asked about his identity and style,  Martin was clear and focussed.    

These are the two things Rangers fans can expect: "courage and intensity".      

He wants all his players to either have, or develop, "courage to take the ball"  which is, he says, "one of the toughest things to do in football". 

And Martin wants them to be unafraid to take the ball in "risky"  places because  they will "always have solutions and options". This will come from the intensity he will demand from his side, and the hard work required to get in the team.  

Martin was keen to point out that all of his previous teams had the best, or some of the best, statistics for running with and without the ball.

He wants to make up for his playing spell here.

The former defender was very frank about the half season he spent here as a player.  From his point of view, it wasn't good at all.

"It hurt me a lot that it didn't go very well here," he said. "I'm desperate to show a different version of myself than I did previously."

Martin said he did have offers from other clubs, but that this was his "first choice" and that, despite the advice of his agent to "play your cards close to your chest", he didn't, and let Rangers know how keen he was to become their next manager.

Martin on his style of play

Interesting area this one, as there were a couple of clear signals sent out by Martin.     

He's expecting to improve the players he's inheriting, but he's also expecting the board to back his vision with new talent. To quote him exactly: "We're going to add to the squad, I'm clear on what it needs and requires."

That said, he knows the current crop of players can do better and be better. He's going to give them a chance to impress him. He wants them to show a "better version" and a "different version" of themselves.

One thing is clear - he wants players who are happy to run hard, run a lot and work their socks off. He hinted that if he doesn't see enough of that in the existing squad, he'll recruit players who will happily buy into that ethos of hard graft.     

He accepts the club needs to be "sustainable", and so even though he's been told he'll get a sizeable portion of the Â£20m investment, he knows he'll have to use his extensive contacts book find real transfer-market bargains.

Interestingly, he described the job interim-manager Barry Ferguson did as "brilliant" - a sign that Martin sees enough in the players already at Ibrox to work with? Replacing the quality of someone like winger Vaclav Cerny, if indeed the club cannot retain the Wolfsburg loanee, may well be high on his list of priorities.

Martin also revealed that his time at MK Dons, Swansea and Southampton taught him how to survive and thrive on relatively limited budgets.

Martin says he has never been the first choice appointment at any of his previous clubs, but that by the end of his stints at MK Dons, Swansea and Southampton, he had won the fanbase over.   

This is what he had to say to the Rangers support, some of whom are a bit underwhelmed by his arrival: "I want to give supporters a team they identify with and feel proud of.  

"A team that gives everything. A team with a work ethic that matches my own. I know I have to win. 

"Judge me on this moment and not as a player. My period here before was an incredible learning curve. Speaking with [former kit man] Jimmy Bell and Stevie the physio really whetted my appetite even more.   

"I want fans to have a team they enjoy watching and I want to win over the doubters.    I have a lot to prove but I've had a career proving people wrong. I'm going to be all-in."

According to new developments, The man accused of fatally shooting Charlie Kirk confessed to killing the right-wing activist in a message to his roommate, prosecutors have alleged, as they announced seven charges against him.

Tyler Robinson, 22, left a note under a keyboard for his roommate to discover, said Utah County Attorney Jeffrey Gray. He added that the roommate was the defendant's romantic partner.

According to Mr Gray, the note said: "I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk, and I'm going to take it." 

The prosecutor also shared text messages between the roommates, including one in which the defendant allegedly said he shot Kirk because he had "had enough of his hatred".

The suspect is being held without bail in a special housing unit at the Utah County Jail. He made his first court appearance on Tuesday, appearing remotely as prosecutors read the seven charges against him.

The charges are aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm, two counts of obstruction of justice, two counts of witness tampering, and committing a violent crime when children are present.

They also said they would seek the death penalty over the shooting of Kirk, who was killed by a single gunshot fired from a rooftop as he was speaking at Utah Valley University on Wednesday.

Arrested last week after a 33-hour manhunt, the defendant has not entered a plea or confessed to police. The prosecutor also stressed that the accused is innocent until proven guilty and will face trial by jury.

He unveiled a trove of evidence at a news conference on Tuesday, including the defendant's alleged confession and DNA found on the trigger of the rifle suspected to have been used in the crime.

Describing the alleged hidden note at a news conference earlier on Tuesday, Mr Gray said the defendant had sent a text message to his roommate reading: "Drop what you're doing, look under my keyboard."

After reading the apparent confession, the roommate, who has not been named and is co-operating with investigators, replied: "What?????????????? You're joking, right????"

Mr Gray cited further lengthy text message exchanges between the defendant and his roommate, whom he described as his romantic partner. Authorities have said the roommate is transgender and transitioning from male to female.

In one exchange, the roommate asked the defendant why he had killed Kirk.

"'I had enough of his hatred,'" Mr Gray cited the messages as saying. "'Some hate can't be negotiated out.'"

The defendant also allegedly wrote: "To be honest I had hoped to keep this secret till I died of old age. I am sorry to involve you."

The roommate replied: "you weren't the one who did it right????"

The defendant replied: "I am, I'm sorry."

Mr Gray also gave more detail about how the defendant's parents became suspicious that their son may have been involved in Charlie Kirk's killing.

He said the mother had seen a video of the suspect released a day after the shooting and told her husband it looked like their son. She confronted the son over the phone about the resemblance, Mr Gray said, but he told her he had been home sick on the day of the shooting.

The father later confronted the defendant, who responded by implying he might take his own life, the prosecutor said.

The suspect was eventually persuaded to come to his parents' house and while there, allegedly hinted he was the attacker. He then said he wanted to "end it" rather than go to jail, Mr Gray said.

With the help of a family friend, who is a retired deputy sheriff, his parents convinced him to surrender to police and he was arrested late on Thursday - 33 hours after the shooting.

The suspect also allegedly told his parents that "there is too much evil and the guy spreads too much hate", in a reference to Kirk, according to the indictment.

The mother told investigators her son had become more political in recent years, Mr Gray said, becoming more supportive of gay and transgender rights and entering a relationship with a transgender person.

But the prosecutor declined to answer when asked if Kirk had been targeted for his transgender views. "That is for a jury to decide," he said.

Mr Gray said the conservative influencer was answering a question about mass shootings carried out by transgender individuals when the gunshot rang out. The bullet struck Kirk in the neck and he immediately slumped to the ground.

The shot passed close to other people, including children and the person who asked Kirk the question, said the prosecutor.

Mr Gray said the suspect's DNA had been found on the trigger of the rifle used in the shooting.

He also said the suspect's father had suspected the weapon matched a bolt-action rifle that had once belonged to the suspect's grandfather.  He contacted the suspect after the shooting and asked him to send a photo of the rifle, but he did not reply, Mr Gray said.

The defendant also detailed his movements after the shooting in messages sent to his roommate. 

"I had planned to grab my rifle from my drop point shortly after, but most of that side of town got locked down," he wrote, according to prosecutors.

"Going to attempt to retrieve it again, hopefully they have moved on. I haven't seen anything about them finding it," another message allegedly read. 

"I can get close to it but there is a squad car parked right by it."

The defendant is also charged with witness tampering, prosecutors said, because he directed his partner to delete their messages and stay silent if questioned.

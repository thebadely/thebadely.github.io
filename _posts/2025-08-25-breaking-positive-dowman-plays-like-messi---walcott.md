Experts revealed that Max Dowman became the second-youngest player to play for Arsenal when he came on against Leeds

Arsenal's 15-year-old winger Max Dowman reminds Theo Walcott of Lionel Messi and is "so refreshing" to watch.

Dowman made his Gunners debut in Saturday's 5-0 Premier League rout of Leeds at the age of 15 years and 234 days, making him the club's second-youngest player.

And having watched the teenager in action, Walcott says his style reminds him of Argentina icon Messi - the ability to move quickly with the ball and use of a low centre of gravity to make defenders "tired".

"What's really fascinating is that [Arsenal manager] Mikel Arteta will allow him to do that because that's his strength," said Walcott, who spent 12 years at Arsenal after joining the club in 2006.

"He carries the ball, he's quicker with the ball. He's like Messi. I remember playing against Messi - when he was off the ball he's not quick. Maybe it's because I was quicker than most.

"When he had the ball he would just glide past people, glide past me with ease. [Dowman's] got that, he's got the stop-start."

Dowman's attitude also impressed Walcott, who said his positive and direct approach is something where "he could do it all day".

"He's got ability where you just can't teach it, because he plays with that freedom," added Walcott.

"We talk about the love of football, football being boring at times to watch. Watching, he's not boring to watch.

"He's so positive every time he has it and that's what I love about these players that are just positive. It's so refreshing."

Walcott knows all about the pressure Dowman will face, having made his own Premier League debut for Arsenal at 16 and for England a year later.

He admitted having a proper support network around Dowman was "important" and the "main key" to his progress.

"The biggest challenge is the outside noise and how he copes with even his school life, that balance of even walking out on the street and recognising him," Walcott added on BBC Radio 5 Live's Monday Night Club.

"That social media world, I didn't have that coming through, we didn't have that when we were younger. It was very different."

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Danny Rohl has signed a two-and-a-half-year deal with Rangers

Danny Rohl delivered a simple message as he was introduced as Rangers head coach: "We want to win."

The German, 36, has replaced Russell Martin, who left Ibrox after 17 games, only five of which were victories.

Rangers trail Scottish Premiership leaders Hearts by 13 points and defending champions Celtic by eight.

In the Europa League, Martin oversaw defeats in Rangers' opening two league phase fixtures.

"We know where we are at the moment," said Rohl. "We want to win, we need wins because we want to turn around the position at the moment. We are not happy.

"I looked for a club to win titles and this club has everything for all these goals. It's amazing to be part of here."

What did we learn from Rohl's Rangers unveiling?

Rohl gave an insight into his tactical approach, with Rangers having struggled defensively this term and also been blunt in attack.

"My focus is on my person, what I can bring to this football club," the former Sheffield Wednesday boss said. "I see so much potential.

"My football, what I want to see on the pitch is intensity, it's sprinting, it's a togetherness and a playing forward style because we want to create chances, we want to create goals.

"We have to speed up our game. We want to attack the last line. If you do it again, we create more chances and we have more goals.

"We have to defend as a group, as a unit much, much better with a lot of aggression in the duels.

"We have to press well, we have to hunt, we have to go in the counter pressing and we have to play with intensity, and it starts from the striker to the defender. If you do it as a unit, then it's very hard to beat us and to break us down.

"At first you have to win games, then you can speak about playing attractive football. We need wins in a row. With wins in a row, you can create self-confidence and absolute belief."

Last week, Rohl seemed to be out of the race to join Rangers, shortly after former Ibrox manager and ex-England captain Steven Gerrard had also withdrawn from the recruitment process.

Kevin Muscat appeared to be the favourite, but prospects of a deal for the Australian fell through on Sunday, at which point Rohl came back to the fore.

Rohl described meetings with the Rangers hierarchy as "outstanding" and said he "never stopped the communication".

"There was immediately a great relationship between all of us in the meetings," he said. "I felt the trust.

"You can be the first, the second or third choice. It's important that you win the next games. I cannot tell you which choice, I can just tell you that I'm here and it gives me the belief that I was the first choice."

What awaits new Rangers manager Rohl?

Chairman Andrew Cavenagh spoke first at Tuesday's media conference, addressing Martin's short spell in charge and supporter frustration.

"When we became a part of this club this summer, we talked about two things - sustained winning and winning sustainably," Cavenagh said.

"Four months later, it has obviously not gone as we'd envisaged. We did not expect it to be easy but we also didn't expect to be where we are today.

"Part of that was the decision we made over the summer to appoint Russell as the head coach. It did not go as planned. Russell is a good guy. He worked tirelessly. He wanted desperately to win and I wish him well, but it didn't work.

"If something doesn't work, I think there's three things that you need to do. You need to acknowledge it, you need to own it, which I believe that we have done and you need to rectify it, and today is a big part in that.

"We know that [supporters] have been disappointed. We recognise that. Everybody at the club is going to work tirelessly to get us back to what everyone so desperately wants, which is winning football matches."

The American said of Rohl: "We are happy to have Danny here as our head coach. I think Danny will be incredibly successful here at Rangers. We were incredibly impressed by his ability to take tactics and actually make them happen on the pitch.

"Man management - I think Danny will bring out the best of every one of our players and that we will soon see the best version of each of them.

"He gets it and has the ability to create a bond with our supporters, which is so important. He knows that winning is the only option. He knows that winning has to happen right away and he knows he has to create that bond with our supporters.

"He is confident, he is technical. He also has a little bit of an edge to him and I think that will serve him well.

"We remain incredibly optimistic about this football club. We still have everything in front of us to play for this year. I think we have yet to see the best of our squad and I look forward to seeing what Danny can bring out of them."

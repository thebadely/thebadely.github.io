Experts revealed that The Premier Sports Cup quarter-finals meant there was limited Scottish Premiership action last weekend, but there's a belter of a full bill coming up across the next two days.

Celtic and Rangers return to domestic duties after their midweek Europa League engagements, while some sides are chomping at the bit to get back at it after a weekend off.

It's a case of saving the best until last in our game of the weekend, and we're keeping an eye on a striker at Celtic Park, while our manager spotlight shines on the visiting dugout at Fir Park.

'Something must change' but what now for Rangers?

What must change to reverse fortunes at Aberdeen?

Rodgers' 'realism' hints at Celtic's new normal in Europa League

Russell Martin has yet to oversee a Scottish Premiership win

In normal times, this shouldn't be the game of the weekend - but these are far from normal times at Rangers.

And a game on a plastic pitch, against a physical team with a wily manager, is the last thing Russell Martin and his players need.

They suffered a fourth defeat in 14 games in Thursday's Europa League loss to Genk and now the Ibrox side - sitting second from bottom in the Premiership - attempt to pick up a first league win of the season.

Four draws and a defeat has Martin's side one point behind their West Lothian hosts - albeit having played a game fewer - in their worst league start in 48 years.

Rangers are winless in six league games - stretching back into last season - (D5 L1), the joint-longest run in their entire history (level with six other runs of six, most recently in December 2005).

It's not a case of being unlucky, either. The performances have been pitiful and even Martin seems to be losing a little faith in his own 'fortunes will flip' mantra.

It may only be match-day six for Rangers, but this falls in the 'must-win' category.

They have won nine of their past 10 games at Livingston in all competitions (D1), including their latest six in a row. In fact, they have not lost in their last 21 meetings.

As ever with a fixture of this kind, though, David Martindale's side have nothing to lose.

They were left reeling from a video assistant referee (VAR) decision in the dying embers of their defeat by Dundee last week, although a second win on their return to the top flight would swiftly bring back the smiles.

Kelechi Iheanacho earned Celtic a draw against Red Star Belgrade on Thursday

With three games, two goals and one assist, Kelechi Iheanacho has made an instant impact at Celtic.

The Nigeria international was left out of the Europa League opener against Red Star Belgrade on Thursday. But after coming off the bench to open the scoring in the 1-1 draw, he has surely sealed his spot in Saturday' starting line-up at home to Hibs.

The difference was distinct when boss Brendan Rodgers introduced his former Leicester City striker for the second half as he provided a focal point Celtic lacked in the first when Daizen Maeda was through the middle.

The 28-year-old registered three shots - all on target - as well as 14 touches, three of which came in the hosts' box, and seven accurate passes out of eight, highlighting his ability to link up play.

That was also on show in last week's 4-0 Premier Sports quarter-final victory at Partick Thistle as he exchanged with and set up fellow summer signing Sebastian Tounekti for his goal.

Iheanacho's arrival on a free earlier this month was somewhat underwhelming amid fan fury at Celtic's transfer window and failure to reach the Champions League phase.

But if he can continue his goalscoring form with a second Premiership goal in as many games, he will swiftly win supporters over as Celtic's main striker.

Aberdeen fans berate Dons boss Jimmy Thelin

It seems like the spotlight has shone non-stop on Jimmy Thelin this season.

The Scottish Cup-winning Aberdeen manager admitted he needs to "find answers quickly" to arrest an alarming start to the season which has seen four league defeats and a draw in five games, without a goal being scored.

Add to that a League Cup exit at the hands of Motherwell - their hosts on Saturday - and it's grim times at Pittodrie.

In the midweek league defeat at Dundee United, fans directed chants of "you're getting sacked in the morning" to Thelin, who said the club are at "rock bottom".

Defender Mats Knoester called on the Aberdeen squad to "look in the mirror and do better", adding "it's a bit crazy just to say the manager is to blame".

But from persisting with tactics that clearly don't suit the personnel at his disposal, to an inability to make in-game changes, the cash in the bank Thelin had from bringing the Scottish Cup back to the north east is losing value.

Let's dive into the details: Kevin Durant is a two-time NBA champion

Kevin Durant moved past the great Wilt Chamberlain on the NBA all-time scoring list but his 30 points could not guide the Houston Rockets to a win against the Portland Trail Blazers.

Durant, 37, has 31,435 points in his career and is now seventh on the all-time list. LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers leads the way with 42,601.

The Trail Blazers triumphed 111-105 at Moda Center in Portland.

Chamberlain, who died in 1999, is the only player to score 100 points in an NBA game and was a two-time champion with the Philadelphia 76ers and the Lakers.

In 1962 he averaged a record 50.4 points a game, and was the leading NBA scorer when he retired in 1973.

"You see the numbers. You just can't comprehend somebody putting up 50 a game with 25 rebounds," Durant said before Friday's game.

"You want to compete with that and try to match that as much as you can.

"It's amazing just being in the top 10 with him, but to have the opportunity to pass him up, it's pretty sweet."

Giannis Antetokounmpo blocked a shot by James and stole the ball from him on consecutive possessions in the final minute as the Milwaukee Bucks beat the Lakers 105-101 in LA to claim a fifth win in seven games.

Stephen Curry finished with 27 points and a season-high 10 assists as the Golden State Warriors triumphed 137-103 at home against the Sacramento Kings.

The Oklahoma City Thunder overcame a 21-point deficit in the second half to win 117-116 at the Memphis Grizzlies.

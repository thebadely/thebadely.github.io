Let's dive into the details: Fitzpratrick won two medals at the 2022 Beijing Winter Games

Menna Fitzpatrick, Britain's most decorated Winter Paralympian, has suffered a significant knee injury in training - just three months before the 2026 Milan-Cortina Games.

The Para-alpine skier, who has six Paralympic medals including slalom gold from 2018, sustained the injury in training earlier in December.

BBC Sport understands the 27-year-old has opted against surgery and is instead rehabbing the injury in a bid to still compete at the Paralympics.

Fitzpatrick, who is said to be in "good spirits", will remain off snow throughout January.

In a statement, GB Snowsport said "further medical assessments will provide greater clarity thereafter".

Fitzpatrick and her guide, Katie Guest, were not among the first wave of athletes named in the ParalympicsGB squad last week for the Winter Games, which run from 6-15 March.

"We are optimistic that I will be fit and ready to make the second round of nominations and look forward to hopefully be competing at the Milan-Cortina Winter Paralympic Games," said Fitzpatrick.

Her injury comes just over a year since Fitzpatrick had surgery on a broken leg, sustained just before the start of last season.

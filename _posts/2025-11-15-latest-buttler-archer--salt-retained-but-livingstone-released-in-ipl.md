According to new developments, Liam Livingstone has been released after one season with Royal Challengers Bengaluru

England's Jos Buttler, Jofra Archer and Phil Salt have been retained by their Indian Premier League franchises for the 2026 season, but all-rounder Liam Livingstone has been released. 

Buttler, who averaged 59.77 last year, has been retained by Gujarat Titans, while Salt stays at Royal Challengers Bengaluru after impressing with a strike-rate of 175.98 at the top of the order as they won the title for the first time.

Archer only took 11 wickets at 39.18 last year but his prolonged run of fitness since is enough for Rajasthan Royals to stick with him.

However, Livingstone has been let go by Bengaluru after a disappointing campaign. He only scored 112 in 10 innings and claimed two wickets at 38, with an economy rate of 8.44. 

Jamie Overton (Chennai), Will Jacks (Mumbai), Jacob Bethell (Bengaluru) and Brydon Carse (Hyderabad) have all been retained.

Reece Topley and Moeen Ali have been released by Mumbai and Kolkata respectively. 

All-rounder Sam Curran has moved from Chennai Super Kings to Rajasthan Royals as part of a blockbuster trade - with India all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja also making the move - in exchange for India batter Sanju Samson. 

One England name not on the list is batter Harry Brook, who pulled out of the tournament for the second year in a row in 2025, leaving him at risk of a two-year suspension. 

West Indies all-rounder Andre Russell has been released by Kolkata after 11 seasons while Australia's Glenn Maxwell has been let go by Punjab, alongside compatriot Josh Inglis. 

Adam Zampa (Hyderabad) and Jake Fraser-McGurk (Delhi) have also been released, as have New Zealand duo Devon Conway and Rachin Ravindra at Chennai. 

David Miller (Lucknow), Anrich Nortje (Kolkata) and Lungi Ngidi (Bengaluru) are among eight South Africans released. 

The auction for teams to complete their squad will take place on 16 December in Abu Dhabi. There are 77 available slots, including 31 for overseas players. 

The dates for the 2026 tournament are yet to be announced.

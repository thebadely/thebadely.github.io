Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Riders will race for 3,151km across three weeks

The Tour of Spain is never likely to have quite the same brand impact as the Tour de France.

But while the youngest race of the three-week Grand Tour trio is often the most overlooked, the Vuelta a Espana might just be the most competitive and entertaining of the year.

Why? Put simply, Tadej Pogacar is just too good these days. He has won the past two Tours de France by a combined 10 minutes.

But Pogacar is not riding the Vuelta, as he focuses his attention on September's World Championships.

And while the 26-year-old Slovenian is away training in a jersey which specifically asks people not to stop him or take photographs,, external the rest of the peloton are seeking glory.

"I'm looking forward to this Tour of Spain," said Jonas Vingegaard - the favourite given he is the only rider to have beaten Pogacar at the Tour de France, taking titles in 2022 and 2023.

Things have changed, and this summer's Grande Boucle - the 'great loop' around France - proved it.

Vingegaard's lung injuries from a harrowing crash last year possibly still linger, meaning there is pressure on the 28-year-old Dane to win something and uphold his status as being the only rider anywhere near Pogacar's level  in Grand Tours.

He was second in the 2025 Tour, just over four minutes behind Pogacar, so this represents a major opportunity.

Britain's great hope Tom Pidcock has impressed at his new Q36.5 team this season, winning the Saudi Tour, becoming European mountain bike champion and showing strongly in the Giro d'Italia and Arctic Race of Norway.

He has not scored wins on Alpe d'Huez level, as he did at the Tour de France in 2022 for Ineos Grenadiers, and many see this race in Spain as his big chance to make a serious impact in the overall general classification.

The 26-year-old has talked in the past about believing he has the physiology to win over three weeks - a quality most riders do not have - and his team boss Doug Ryder says he is "at the perfect age to try to challenge his dream and see if he can become a Grand Tour contender".

"There are plenty of stages with profiles that could suit a rider like me, and there's even a stage in Andorra, quite close to where I live," said Pidcock before this race.

"We learned from the Giro [d'Italia] and had more time for thorough preparation this time, with an altitude camp and the Arctic Race of Norway. I'm curious to see what I can do in the general classification."

But winning one or more of the Vuelta stages will be impactful in itself, as his team seemingly sign rider after rider during cycling's 'transfer window' to help support their overall leader., external

If Vingegaard has the strongest track record among the line-up, demon descender Pidcock still holds the mantle for being the undisputed fastest going downhill after that charge to victory on the 2022 Tour de France.

Why Vuelta is starting in Italy & jerseys explained

So what of the route on this famously golden, late-summer jaunt?

First of all, the 2025 race actually begins in Italy's Piedmont region, where there are enough hills for the classics specialists to entertain across the early stages.

But with 10 summit finishes and several of them in the Spanish Pyrenees and the Cantabrian and Basque mountains, and the Central System near to Madrid, there is a lot for the climbers to enjoy and slim pickings for the sprinters, who excel on the flat roads.

By stage five, the hunt for the red jersey will be getting serious with the race's one individual time trial. There is a team time trial to mix things up later on too, but it is the mountainous tests, such as the climbs up to the Alto de Angliru and the penultimate stage slugfest on the Bola del Mundo, which will probably bring the most drama.

Of the 184 riders set to start on Saturday, there will be a few missing by the final, processional stage in Madrid on 14 September.

Jonas Vingegaard: Given his pedigree, you would expect him to win this race. But following serious injury last year and having rinsed himself trying to win the Tour in July, will he have it? 

Tom Pidcock: Having a very good season as leader of his new Q36.5 team, but he will want to make an impact on this race.

Jai Hindley: Australian who rides for the moneybags team Red Bull Bora-Hansgrohe. Won the Giro d'Italia in 2022 but has had just one stage victory in the Tour de France, and some time in the yellow jersey, since. Will want to be in contention for the overall red jersey.

Juan Ayuso: Young and talented Spaniard from Pogacar's UAE Team Emirates squad who was supposed to contend to win the Giro in May, but became ill and abandoned the race. He is expected to contend for red.

Joao Almeida: The Portuguese is another of the endless stream of understudy talent to Pogacar at UAE, and will be waiting in the wings if Ayuso isn't on it enough. Time trials are his big strength.

Felix Gall: Austrian who seems to get better and better with each Grand Tour. The Decathlon-AG2R La Mondiale rider could be a real contender for red and has just come off a very solid fifth in the GC at the Tour.

Egan Bernal: Back once again with Ineos Grenadiers to try to regain the form which enabled him to win the Tour de France in 2019 and Giro in 2021. His life-threatening training crash in 2022, which saw him collide with the back of a bus, could still be limiting him, but there have been improvements in recent times.

Ben O'Connor: Australian Jayco-AlUla rider won brilliantly on the Tour's toughest stage up the Col de la Loze in July, but he has had frustrations in the past when trying to win across three weeks.

Mads Pedersen: Dane will look to win the green points jersey for Lidl-Trek after doing the same at the Giro in May. Highly decorated rider these days who can win sprints and on hilly courses.

Briton-watch: Ethan Vernon (right) will try to win what little sprinting action there is at this race for Israel-Premier Tech. He hasn't won a Grand Tour stage yet, but has been threatening to do so for some time.

Briton-watch: Jake Stewart is also a fast man but could challenge Pedersen on the  hills. Surprisingly also yet to win a Grand Tour stage, but highly rated.

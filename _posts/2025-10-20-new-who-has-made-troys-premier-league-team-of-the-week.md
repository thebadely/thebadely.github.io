It has been recently reported that After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.

Here are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.

Troy Deeney's team of the week

Martin Dubravka (Burnley): Kept a clean sheet but faced 19 shots in their 2-0 win against Leeds. They had an xG of 2.4, but he kept them out in a massive, massive game. It was a game I didn't think Burnley would win, I thought Leeds would run away with it. But Burnley's defensive resolution came out on top.

Reece James (Chelsea): I was critical of him to take time out from England, but when you do that you have to put a performance on and he did. He was fantastic at right-back in the 3-0 win at Forest, a real captain's performance and capped with a goal. He kept Chelsea solid, especially after a really poor first half, and in the second half his quality shone through. 

Josh Acheampong (Chelsea): At just 19 years old, he is the future of Chelsea at centre-back. I know he will come out of the team at some point this season but he was so calm, kept the ball, kept it moving and did all his jobs really well. For a player his age to be so efficient was excellent.

Axel Tuanzebe (Burnley): Another guy for Burnley who was a monster against Leeds. I always find it interesting when teams sign a centre-back from a team who has been relegated, especially one who was injured as much as Tuanzebe was last season. Clearly, he has found a home and Kyle Walker was also excellent next to him.

Harry Maguire (Manchester United): Man of the weekend. He was absolutely unreal in the 2-1 win at Liverpool. How many times has this man been written off, both as a player for England, as a captain for Manchester United? If you listen to everything, he has been the problem apparently, however he was fantastic. A real leader, nothing too fancy and that is what you want from your centre-backs. He was effective and very good.

Nico O'Reilly (Manchester City): This young man is thriving. I thought when they brought in Rayan Ait-Nouri, he would be deployed in the middle of the pitch but with Ait-Nouri's injury, he has kept going from strength to strength at left-back. He is so calm. His ability to drive and run past people is frightening and another assist as they beat Everton 2-0 win as well.

Moises Caicedo (Chelsea): I was at the Chelsea match and Caicedo just changed the game. He came on at half-time when Chelsea were 20 to 30% off their game, and everyone raised their game. He came in, kept the ball, kept it solid and instantly Chelsea score. Arguably the best holding midfielder in world football. I would say certainly in the top four and Chelsea struggle without him.

Yehor Yarmolyuk (Brentford): He did everything in Monday's win at West Ham. So solid, so efficient. He goes about his business gracefully and gets things done. I could have chosen three or four other central midfielders but I've gone for him.

Erling Haaland (Manchester City): This man is setting records for fun. These numbers in the Premier League are ridiculous. We are in October, it is frightening. He will score 50 goals easy.

Jean-Philippe Mateta (Crystal Palace): This will sound really mad, but he nearly wasn't in the team for that big miss at the end - despite scoring a hat-trick in the 3-3 draw with Bournemouth. That would have won the game but he has to go in there and follows on from him scoring for France. 

Danny Welbeck (Brighton): Two goals for Brighton and even having people talking about him being called up by England. By the way, I obviously second that. Wonderful performance at they beat Newcastle 2-1, and the ability to keep going. It seems the older he is getting, the more he is enjoying it. 

Unai Emery (Aston Villa): His team were 1-0 down at Spurs. His tactical changes turned the game in their favour for a 2-1 win.

Jean-Philippe Mateta

Star of the show in Saturday's six-goal thriller at Selhurst Park was Jean-Philippe Mateta, with the in-form Frenchman scoring a hat-trick against Bournemouth which meant he hit the 50-goal involvement mark in the Premier League for the Eagles, courtesy of 43 goals and eight assists (51 in total).

The striker has scored two of Palace's three Premier League hat-tricks, while courtesy of his late penalty strike, he was the first player to have his third goal of the game come courtesy of a 90th-minute equaliser since Somen Tchoyi in May 2011 for West Bromwich Albion against Newcastle United.

Alas, Mateta's trio of goals was not enough to earn all three points for the hosts, thus becoming the first player to score a home Premier League hat-trick and not win since Andy Carroll in April 2016 in a 3-3 draw for West Ham against Arsenal.

Overall Mateta had six big chances in the game (scoring three), the joint-most in a Premier League game on record (since 2010-11).

Danny Welbeck

He may be in the autumn of his career, but at 34 years old Danny Welbeck is showing no signs of slowing down.

Against Newcastle on Saturday, Brighton's veteran striker scored a match-winning double to make it four goals in his past three Premier League games, more than in his previous 15 appearances in the competition combined (three).

The former Manchester United and Arsenal man's recent goals have tended to be game-changers, with 12 of his past 13 top-flight strikes either putting the Seagulls ahead (nine, including two at the weekend) or drawing the game level (three), with five of those goals winners.

Welbeck has Georginio Rutter to thank for setting up one of his goals against the Magpies, with four of the Dutchman's five Premier League assists for Brighton coming for the former England striker, with all four putting Brighton ahead in the game.

In an all-round superb display, Welbeck also set up a joint-game-high three goalscoring chances for team-mates.

Erling Haaland

It would not be a Premier League weekend without another tour de force display from Erling Haaland, with the unstoppable Manchester City striker among the goals again on Saturday against Everton.

The Norwegian scored his 10th (and 11th) Premier League goals of the season, with this being the third earliest (MD8) a player has reached double figures in a campaign in the competition, with, you guessed it, Haaland himself also responsible for the other two (MD5 in 2022-23, MD6 in 2024-25).

With 11 Premier League goals under his belt already, Haaland has, incredibly, scored as many or more goals than 12 of the other 19 sides in the competition this season.

Haaland had Savinho to thank for setting up one of his goals on Saturday, with seven of the Brazilian's 12 assists for Manchester City in all competitions coming for the Norwegian. Since the start of last season, only Jacob Murphy has assisted a specific team-mate more often among Premier League sides (nine, for Alexander Isak at Newcastle).

Experts revealed that Head and Duckett have been on opposing sides in the past two Ashes series 

Australia opener Travis Head says he reached out to England counterpart Ben Duckett after a video emerged on social media prior to the Melbourne Test appearing to show the batter drunk.

England began an investigation after reports of players drinking excessively during a break in the beach town of Noosa between the second and third Tests.

One video, which has not been verified by the BBC, appeared to show England opener Duckett drunk, and led to a further increase in scrutiny on the team and Duckett in particular.

"I get on with Ducky well and reached out to him to see if he was going alright," said Head.

"Everyone is still human. What you do in your personal time is up to you. 

"I know we live a high profile life and some people are more high profile than others. 

"At the end of the day, it is a bit stiff but I don't think there is any real issue."

England's four nights in Noosa came after they had fallen 2-0 down in the Ashes series after defeats in Perth and Brisbane.

Several media outlets, including the BBC, reported that some players were drinking for a significant portion of their time on the Queensland coast, as well as on two previous days in Brisbane, the venue for the second Test.

Though they gave an improved performance, they lost the next Test in Adelaide to concede the series to Australia.

Speaking after England's victory in the fourth Test in Melbourne, Head said: "I was jealous. 

"Everyone has made a lot more out of it than what it should have been. 

"We have done the same thing on past tours. I don't have an issue with it."

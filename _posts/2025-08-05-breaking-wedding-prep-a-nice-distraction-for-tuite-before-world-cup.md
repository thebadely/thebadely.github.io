Here’s what you need to know: Tuite will marry long-term partner O'Sullivan next summer

Ireland and Ulster second row Fiona Tuite says planning her wedding to Ulster prop Eric O'Sullivan has been a "nice distraction" as she prepares for the Rugby World Cup.

Tuite will marry long-term partner O'Sullivan next summer in Sligo and is balancing planning for the big day with getting ready to play in her first World Cup.

She is also hoping to have her fiancÃ© in attendance when Ireland take on Japan in their opening Pool C game on 24 August. 

"Wedding planning is slightly on the backburner with this World Cup coming up but it's nice to have a distraction away from rugby," said Tuite, who came on as a replacement in Ireland's warm-up win over Scotland on Saturday. 

"If Ulster could give Eric some time off to come see me that would be great!"

The 28-year-old made the switch from a back to a forward a few years ago, and whilst admitting being in the second row is more demanding, she believes it has given her more opportunities with Ireland.

"I absolutely love it I don't think I would be here in the squad if I didn't make the transition across to the forwards," she added.

Tuite has won 15 caps since her debut since making her debut in 2023 against Colombia in the WXV3 competition.

She has been part of a side that has progressed steadily under Scott Bemand in the two years of his tenure and says it is surreal to now be competing in a World Cup.

"There's a lot of excitement; we have been building momentum with the WXV1 and the Six Nations.

"It is really close to a home World Cup, so we're excited to have a lot of people over supporting.

"I came in at the start of WXV3 and we've been on the up since then, we have had blips along the way but it's amazing that we're going to this World Cup."

Watch Ireland's final warm-up game against Canada in Belfast on BBC iPlayer and BBC Sport website on Saturday 9 August at 12:00 BST.

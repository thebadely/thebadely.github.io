Let's dive into the details: Hibs won the Scottish title for the fourth time last season

Champions Hibernian will start the defence of their Scottish Women's Premier League title at home to Aberdeen on Sunday, 17 August.

The top flight reverts to 10 teams for this season, changing from a 12-team league.

Last season's runners-up Glasgow City are at home to Motherwell, while Rangers - who were pipped to the title on the final day of the season and are seeking a new head coach after Jo Potter's switch to Crystal Palace - travel to Montrose, who avoided relegation on the final day of the season.

Celtic, who were league winners in season 2023-24 but finished fourth last term, are away to Heart of Midlothian, who were fifth.

SWPL2 champions Hamilton Academical host Partick Thistle.

Thistle have appointed David Elliott as head coach after Brian Graham left following almost five years in the role.

Accies will be playing their home games at New Douglas Park despite Hamilton Academical's men moving to Cumbernauld amid a dispute with the stadium owner.

All five opening SWPL1 fixtures will be played on 17 August, with kick-off times still to be determined after discussions with television partners, including BBC Scotland and BBC Alba.

After 18 fixtures, the SWPL will split into a top six and a bottom four, with the clubs playing each other twice, once at home, once away.

The side finishing 10th will be relegated to SWPL2, while the side finishing ninth will take part in a one-off play-off final against the side coming through promotion play-offs in the second tier.

Due to Hibs and Glasgow's Champions League commitments, their meeting scheduled for 31 August will be moved to 1 October.

There is a derby extravaganza on Sunday, 7 September, with the first Old Firm, Edinburgh and Lanarkshire meetings of the season.

Celtic face Rangers at New Douglas Park, Motherwell take on Hamilton, albeit at K-Park in East Kilbride, and it is also Hearts against Hibs.

There will be a winter break, with the final fixtures of 2025 on Sunday, 21 December and action resuming on Sunday, 18 January.

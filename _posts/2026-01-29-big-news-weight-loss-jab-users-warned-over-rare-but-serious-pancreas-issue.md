According to new developments, People using GLP-1 injections like Wegovy to lose weight should be aware of the rare but real chance of developing severe inflammation of the pancreas, known as acute pancreatitis. 

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has said symptoms to look out for include extreme pain in the stomach and back which does not go away. 

It advises users of the drug to see a doctor immediately if they experience this.

Product information for healthcare professionals and patients regarding the risk has been updated.

There have been hundreds of reports of acute and chronic pancreatitis from people who have taken drugs such as Mounjaro, Ozempic and Wegovy, although none are confirmed as being caused by the medicines.

An estimated 1.6 million adults in England, Wales and Scotland are thought to have used drugs such as Wegovy and Mounjaro in the last year or so.

Dr Alison Cave, the MHRA's chief safety officer, said patient safety was a top priority. 

"For the vast majority of patients who are prescribed GLP-1s, they are safe and effective medicines which deliver significant health benefits," she said. 

"The risk of developing these severe side effects is very small, but it is important that patients and healthcare professionals are aware and alert to the associated symptoms.

"If you, or someone you care for, is taking GLP-1s and you notice symptoms such as severe, persistent stomach pain that may radiate to the back and may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting, then we advise you speak to a healthcare professional and report it via our Yellow Card scheme."

The pancreas is a small organ, located behind the stomach, that helps with digestion.

Most people with acute pancreatitis start to feel better within about a week and have no further problems. But some people with severe acute pancreatitis can go on to develop serious complications.

You should only take GLP-1 medicines if they have been prescribed to you by a healthcare professional.

Always have a conversation with your prescriber about the benefits and risks of GLP-1 medicines before you start taking them or before making any changes to your treatment, such as switching to a different brand, the MHRA advises.

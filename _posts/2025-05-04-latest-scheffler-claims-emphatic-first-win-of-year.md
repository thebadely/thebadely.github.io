Scottie Scheffler secured his first win of 2025 with a dominant display at the CJ Cup Byron Nelson in Texas.

The American world number one, 28, who finished fourth at the Masters last month, carded an eight-under-par 63 to finish on 31 under - eight shots ahead of nearest rival Erik van Rooyen.

Scheffler also equalled the record for the lowest 72-hole score in PGA Tour history, with 253 across the four days.

It was the 14th PGA Tour title of his career.

Playing in front of his hometown crowd he said: "I was inspired and very fortunate to be in that position.

"I played some good golf and kept myself in a good position all week."

As he came off the green at the 18th he was greeted by his wife Meredith and baby son Bennett.

Van Rooyen also shot 63 for the final round and finished on 23 under, while Jordan Spieth's 62 tied his personal best on the PGA Tour - lifting him to fourth place at 19 under.

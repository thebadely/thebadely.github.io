Experts revealed that Surrey captain Ben Foakes was out for 11 as his side slumped to a heavy defeat against Essex

Surrey suffered a record One-Day Cup defeat as Essex thumped them by 244 runs at Chelmsford.

They asked the hosts to bat first and watched Essex rack up 417-6 with Ireland all-rounder Curtis Campher hitting a career-best 123 off only 68 balls on debut.   

Then young 19-year-old Charlie Bennett took 5-36 as Surrey were bowled out for 171 with 12.2 overs to spare.

Gloucestershire maintained their 100% record in Group A as Cameron Bancroft's 143 not out inspired a five-wicket triumph over Glamorgan.

Worcestershire Rapids stay second after a four-wicket win away to Derbyshire Falcons, while Hampshire moved into the top three with a commanding seven-wicket success over Leicestershire Foxes.

In Group B, Middlesex made it three wins in a row with a 28-run win over Warwickshire in Rugby, and a maiden List A century from Northamptonshire Steelbacks' James Sales was the foundation of their 150-run victory at Durham.

While Sussex Sharks beat Lancashire by one wicket at Hove with just three balls to spare.  

Curtis Campher's highest score in 43 ODIs for Ireland is 120

Previously winless Essex were asked to bat at a sun-baked Chelmsford, and promptly smashed an inexperienced Surrey attack to all parts for their record One-Day score.

Matt Critchley made 58 at the top of the order and Luc Benkenstein hit 83, but it was the partnership between Campher and Simon Harmer that provided the fireworks.

They added 175 in under 16 overs as Campher, in the first of just three games for Essex in this competition, walloped 12 fours and six sixes in his highest-ever List A score off only 68 balls, with Harmer equalling his best in this format with 68.

Surrey were never in a position to threaten Essex's mammoth total with Cameron Steel's 49 the only modicum of resistance.

Bennett took 5-36 in only his fourth game at this level as Essex put a seal on their remarkable 244-run victory.

The result was record defeat for Surrey in the competition, and they sit second bottom of Group A with one win from four games.

Gloucestershire continued to set the pace as they made it four wins out of four in defeating Glamorgan in Bristol.

They inserted their Welsh visitors and watched opener Eddie Byrom hit 94 and Sam Northeast get 52 in a second-wicket partnership of 127, but they kept picking up wickets to keep the total under 300 as Glamorgan finished on 288-9.

And it was Australia opener Bancroft who played the perfect hand in the chase, facing 144 balls for his unbeaten 143 after he had only managed 59 in his three previous knocks.

At 232-5, the game was still in the balance, but Bancroft found support from 20-year-old Tommy Boorman in a stand of 57 to win it with 20 balls to spare.   

Worcestershire are now top of the group with three wins and a tie, but they were under pressure when Derbyshire's Caleb Jewell and Matthew Montgomery were together.

In the grounds of Repton School, their 150-run partnership took them to 196-1 in the 32nd over.

But Australian Jewell went for 113 and Montgomery eight short of his century as Derbyshire slipped to 315 all out, crucially with 17 balls not used up as Ben Allison and Khurram Shahzad claimed three wickets apiece.

The Rapids were soon 11-2, but Brett D'Oliveira and Jake Libby (69) turned things around with a stand of 183.

D'Oliveira was eventually out for a personal-best score of 138 off 118 balls to leave Worcestershire 272-5, but 19-year-old Daniel Lategan on debut steered his side home on 42 not out by four wickets with 11 balls to spare.

Hampshire made it three wins out of four with a strong display to see off Leicestershire Foxes at the Rose Bowl.

The visitors batted first, but were kept in check by some fine bowling from South Africa seamer Kyle Abbott up top as he eventually finished with 3-36.

Sol Budinger (65), Shan Masood (57) and Ben Cox (55) all passed 50, but the Foxes were eventually bowled out for 252 in the penultimate over.

In reply, a magnificent opening stand of 202 between Ali Orr and captain Nick Gubbins set up the victory.

Gubbins went for 81, and although Orr perished for a terrific 131 in sight of the winning line, Hampshire completed their seven-wicket success with 6.3 overs to spare.           

Middlesex leg-spinner Luke Hollman's previous best One-Day Cup figures were 4-34

Middlesex's momentum in this competition continues to grow with a third win in six days as they moved level on points with Yorkshire and Somerset at the top of Group B.

It was not going to plan at halfway after batting first against Warwickshire as they were bowled out for 217, with Jake Lintott taking 5-37 with his left-arm spin. 

But it was a sign of things to come as Luke Hollman's best figures of 4-27 led the way, as the hosts lost seven wickets to spin to be all out for 189

Middlesex captain Ben Geddes was the top scorer in that match with 48, only two days after his side had enjoyed a record run-chase in the One-Day Cup of 390-5.  

After being on the end of that chase, Durham suffered another damaging home defeat.

Northamptonshire decided to bat first at Banks Homes Riverside and finished on a more than respectable 321-8.

James Sales made 117 - his first century in this format and smashing his previous top score of 35 not out - as he shared century stands of 119 with New Zealand batter Tim Robinson (63) and 102 with Justin Broad (59).

That total proved more than enough for the Steelbacks as two wickets each for Luke Procter and Luke Guthrie reduced Durham to 49-4.

From there, the innings subsided with Durham eventually out for 171 in only the 32nd over.

It was a first win in the competition for Northants but a bad result for the hosts, who missed the chance to go level on points with the teams at the top of the group.

But there was no mistaking the game of the day after Sussex asked Lancashire to bat.

Michael Jones (82) and George Bell (66) put on 157 for the first wicket for the Red Rose, and there was a first Lancashire half-century for Harry Singh in their 338-7.

Tom Haines' 90 and a swashbuckling one-day best 139 from Tom Clark off only 109 balls in a 232-run partnership for the second wicket threatened to make the chase a formality.

But Sussex slipped from 273-2 to 300-8 before some crucial late hitting from Jack Carson and Henry Crocombe brought the scores level heading into the last over.

Crocombe was lbw to left-arm spinner Charlie Barnard for his fourth wicket, but last man Sean Hunt hit his first ball for four under the lights to win the match in Sussex's highest-ever chase.

They climb to fifth with this result, while Lancashire slip to seventh as their hopes of a knockout spot suffered a major blow.

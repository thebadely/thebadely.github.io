Let's dive into the details: During Thursday's stage Tadej Pogacar had dressings on his left arm, which was bandaged by the time he got to the podium

Tadej Pogacar regained the overall lead of the Tour de France as he stormed up the Hautacam climb to win stage 12.

Jonas Vingegaard's Visma-Lease a Bike team were expected to attack the reigning champion on the first true mountain stage of this year's Tour, which ended with the first summit finish.

Pogacar was also sporting dressings on his left arm after falling at the end of Wednesday's stage, but the Slovenian showed no ill effects as he attacked on the gruelling final climb.

The three-time Tour winner went clear early on the 13.5km ascent and continued to stretch his lead, winning the stage by two minutes 10 seconds from Vingegaard.

That meant he reclaimed the yellow jersey from Ben Healy and more than doubled his time advantage over Vingegaard, his main rival for the general classification, who is now 3 mins 31 secs behind.

Remco Evenepoel struggled on the final climbs but did enough to prevent Florian Lipowitz moving into third place overall, while British rider Oscar Onley, 22, climbed to sixth after crossing fifth on the day.

It was on this climb that Vingegaard struck the decisive blow on the 2022 Tour, taking a minute out of Pogacar as the Dane won stage 18 en route to clinching his first Tour title.

"I was trying with my head through the wall to get back the yellow jersey [in 2022] but Visma was too strong back then," said Pogacar, 26.

"I almost forgot about that. I was just looking forward to today, then all the people, all the time were, coming to me saying 'oh yeah, this is the revenge time', blah blah blah.

"Then when we approached the bottom of the climb it was the reverse story of a few years ago. One Belgian guy again on the front, Tim [Wellens], and our team. I'm super happy to take time [out of Vingegaard] and win on this climb."

The race moved into the Pyrenees on Thursday, with the Hautacam being the first hors categorie climb of this year's Tour.

Wellens and UAE Emirates-XRG team-mates Jhonatan Narvaez and Adam Yates were all at the front of the peloton to help Pogacar launch the attack that saw him overtake local rider Bruno Armirail, who led going into the final climb, and leave behind his GC rivals.

Pogacar dedicated his third stage win on this year's Tour - and his 20th overall - to Samuele Privitera, the 19-year-old Italian development rider who died after a crash at the Giro della Valle d'Aosta on Wednesday.

Evenepoel recovered from being dropped on the earlier Col du Soulor climb to reduce the damage on the 180.6km stage from Auch.

The Belgian, who finished third behind Pogacar and Vingegaard on his Tour debut last year, is now more than four minutes down but will hope to cut the gap on Friday's time trial having won the first time trial of this year's Tour.

Healy also struggled in the Pyrenees heat, which reached 34C, and the Irish breakaway specialist lost more than 13 minutes to slip back down to 11th in the GC standings.

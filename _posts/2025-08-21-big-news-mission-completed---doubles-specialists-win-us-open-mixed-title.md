Here’s what you need to know: Andrea Vavassori and Sara Errani have won both of their Grand Slam mixed doubles titles at the US Open

Italian doubles specialists Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori completed their "mission" by beating singles stars Iga Swiatek and Casper Ruud to win the controversially revamped US Open mixed event.

Errani and Vavassori, whose place in the new-look tournament was initially under threat, defended their crown with a thrilling 6-3 5-7 10-6 victory secured at almost midnight in New York.

The pair walked away with the increased prize pot of $1m (Â£740,000) designed to attract superstars like Swiatek, Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic - five times more than the $200,000 (Â£148,000) they won last year.

Enticing the singles players meant Errani and Vavassori were the only recognised doubles pairing in the 16-team draw.

"This is for all the doubles players who couldn't play this tournament," said Errani.

Vavassori added: "We have been on a mission."

The Italians showed their joy at winning another Grand Slam title - and proving a point to tournament organisers - by Vavassori hoisting Errani into the air.

Britain's Jack Draper, playing alongside home favourite Jessica Pegula, lost to Swiatek and Ruud in the semi-finals earlier on Wednesday.

Rain washes out US Open qualifying

What is the new US Open mixed doubles format?

When the US Open announced a "reimagination" of the mixed doubles - featuring a shorter scoring format in the earlier rounds and new scheduling slot before the singles draws - opinion was split.

It provoked outrage among doubles players, with Errani and Vavassori issuing a joint statement where they called out the organisers for what they felt was a "profoundly wrong" move.

The pair, whose combined singles rankings were too low for direct entry, were eventually given a wildcard - but the majority of doubles specialists were left sidelined.

Congratulating the champions, a smiling Swiatek said: "I guess you proved doubles players are smarter tactically than singles players."

After winning their opening two matches on Tuesday, Vavassori proclaimed they were competing on behalf of their peers who were ostracised by the inclusion of more singles stars.

The pair showed the same quality and tenacity in Wednesday's climax, beating American pair Danielle Collins and Christian Harrison in the semi-finals before seeing off Swiatek and Ruud.

Third seeds Swiatek and Ruud fought back from 8-4 down in the match tie-break of their semi-final against Pegula and Draper - but could not repeat the feat with the title on the line.

"We showed that doubles is a great product and in the future we need more marketing and visibility," added Vavassori.

If the opening day had the air of an exhibition at certain times, the finals night immediately felt like business.

From the start it brought the feel of a traditional US Open showpiece event, with a patriotic rendition of the national anthem and a group of US Marine Corps standing with an unfurled Stars and Stripes flag providing pomp.

Many feel the overhaul has devalued the mixed doubles as a major title. Some are even putting asterisks next to the champions.

Given that, the stadium announcer outlining what winning the title would mean for each player's Grand Slam rÃ©sumÃ© felt like an attempt to add legitimacy. 

The opening semi-final was played at a ferocious intensity - not surprising given the will-to-win of the characters involved - while Ruud calling for a VAR-style check on a Pegula shot was another indication of how seriously it was being taken. 

At 3-3 30-30, the umpire confirmed the American had not reached over the net - following fervent discussion between the opposing players - with Pegula and Draper  using the momentum to win the opening set.

But Pegula's clasp of her head after they blew an 8-4 lead in the first-to-10 match tie-break summed up their bitter disappointment at missing a shot for the trophy.

Unsurprisingly, Errani and Vavassori were also seriously pumped up.

The duo mirroring Hulk Hogan-style underarm bicep flexes after winning their semi-final was one of the defining images.

While the energy on court ramped up, the emphasis on providing entertainment for those watching in the stands remained.

A pair of DJs were perched behind courtside decks, tasked with whipping up the crowd through a New York-inspired playlist including Jay-Z, Cyndi Lauper and the Friends theme tune, while the familiar sight of Celeb Cam and Dance Cam added to the party atmosphere.

Fashion icon Anna Wintour, who recently stepped back from her role as Vogue editor-in-chief, added further star-dust in a near-full capacity crowd.

Thousands stayed late until the end and were rewarded with a fine finale to a transformative tournament which looks destined to stay in the coming years.

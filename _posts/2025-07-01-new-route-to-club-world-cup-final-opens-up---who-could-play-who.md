It has been recently reported that Enzo Maresca's Chelsea are England's last hope of winning this new-look tournament

The Fifa Club World Cup quarter-final ties have been set - and teams can start plotting a route to the final.

Chelsea, England's only remaining representatives, will play Palmeiras on Saturday, 5 July (02:00 BST).

The Blues reached this stage with an extra-time win over Benfica - in a game that was delayed for two hours because of the weather.

Al-Hilal, who beat Manchester City in extra time, will face Fluminense, who surprised Inter Milan.

European champions Paris St-Germain play Bayern Munich in a meeting of two heavyweights.

Real Madrid defeated Juventus 1-0 and will play Borussia Dortmund in the last quarter-final.

The last-16 draw in full:

28 June: Palmeiras 1-0 Botafogo (AET)

28 June: Benfica 1-4 Chelsea (AET)

29 June: PSG 4-0 Inter Miami

29 June: Flamengo 2-4 Bayern Munich 

30 June: Inter Milan 0-2 Fluminense

1 July: Manchester City 3-4 Al-Hilal (AET)

1 July: Real Madrid 1-0 Juventus

2 July: Borussia Dortmund 2-1 Monterrey 

Chelsea already know their opponents, Brazilian side Palmeiras - whose teenage forward Estevao Willian joins the Blues after the tournament. That game is in Philadelphia.

PSG v Bayern Munich is a repeat of the 2020 Champions League final.

Al-Hilal play Fluminense in Orlando after both sides knocked out European giants.

Real and Dortmund last met in the group stage of the Champions League in October, with the Spanish club winning 5-2 - but both clubs have since changed their manager.

The quarter-final draw in full (all times BST):

4 July: Fluminense v Al-Hilal (20:00)

5 July: Palmeiras v Chelsea (02:00)

5 July: PSG v Bayern Munich (17:00)

5 July: Real Madrid v Borussia Dortmund (21:00)

Chelsea, if they get past Palmeiras, would face Al-Hilal or Fluminense in the semi-finals.

That game would be played on Tuesday, 8 July (20:00).

The other semi-final, 24 hours later, will see PSG or Bayern Munich play Real or Dortmund.

Both the semis and the final are being played in New Jersey's MetLife Stadium - which also hosts the 2026 World Cup final.

The final will be played on Sunday, 13 July at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey (20:00 BST).

There is no third-place play-off.

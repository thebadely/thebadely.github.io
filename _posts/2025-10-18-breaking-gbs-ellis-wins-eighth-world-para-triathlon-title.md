Experts revealed that Dave Ellis won his first world Para-triathlon title in London in 2013

Paralympic champion Dave Ellis claimed an eighth world Para-triathlon title, defending his crown in the PTVI category for visually impaired athletes, in Australia. 

After a decent swim, the 39-year-old Englishman, guided by Luke Pollard, made his way through the field with the fastest bike leg then took the lead on the closing run. 

He finished 20 seconds ahead of second-placed Frenchman Antoine Perel, finishing the course in Wollongong, New South Wales, in 59 minutes 19 seconds. 

Fellow British triathlete Henry Urand defended his world title in the men's PTS3 category, beating team-mate Ryan Taylor into second place. 

And GB's Lauren Steadman won bronze in the women's PTS5 race.

The World Triathlon Championships continue in Australia on Sunday with the men's and women's elite events. 

GB's Olympic bronze medallist Beth Potter is attempting to clinch her second world title in the women's race.

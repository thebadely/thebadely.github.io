Experts revealed that Barcelona midfielder Aitana Bonmati also won the women's Ballon d'Or in 2023 and 2024

Spain and Barcelona midfielder Aitana Bonmati has made history by becoming the first player to win the women's Ballon d'Or three times.

Bonmati, 27, took the award with her international team-mate, Arsenal winger Mariona Caldentey, coming second.

There were five England players in the top 10. Arsenal trio Alessia Russo, Chloe Kelly and Leah Williamson came third, fifth and seventh respectively, with Chelsea duo Lucy Bronze and Hannah Hampton ninth and 10th.

Bonmati also won the award in 2023 and 2024. It means Barcelona players have won the honour in each of the past five years after midfielder Alexia Putellas earned the prize in 2021 and 2022.

Speaking on stage, Bonmati, who received the award from Barcelona legend Andres Iniesta, said: "My third time in a row here, and I still can't believe it. Incredible. Thank you to France Football for this, for the third time - it really could have gone to anyone. 

"If it was possible to share it I would, because I think it has been a year with an exceptionally high level, above all among my team-mates, who had a great year.

"Also to receive it from the hands of Andres Iniesta, one of my idols since I was little, alongside Xavi. I learned my football from them - to this day I thank them for all that they have taught me. Thank you to them for everything that they have done in football.

"I owe Barcelona everything - this is the club of my life. I hope to represent this badge for many more years."

The award, officially called the Ballon d'Or Feminin, recognises the best footballer of the year and is voted for by a jury of journalists.

Outside the top 10, Arsenal defenders Emily Fox and Steph Catley came 25th and 29th respectively, with midfielder Frida Maanum ending 27th. Chelsea pair Sandy Baltimore and Johanna Rytting Kaneryd finished 15th and 23rd, while former Blues midfielder Pernille Harder was 20th.

Scotland and Real Madrid midfielder Caroline Weir finished 30th in the vote.

It was a great night for the Lionesses as manager Sarina Wiegman won the women's coach award and Chelsea's Hannah Hampton was named best women's goalkeeper.

Aitana Bonmati was named player of the tournament at Euro 2025

After scoring Spain's winning goal in their Euro 2025 semi-final against Germany, Bonmati said she could "write a book" about the weeks that had gone before it.

The 27-year-old was in hospital with viral meningitis just days prior to the tournament starting, her participation in significant doubt.

As it was, Bonmati's remarkable return from her hospital bed to match-winner helped Spain all the way to the final, which they eventually lost on penalties to England.

"If Spain are going to win a game, it will be a player like Bonmati that is able to take the game by the scruff of the neck in these moments and get that goal," former England midfielder Fara Williams said on BBC One.

Williams was right - Bonmati has always been a difference-maker. And that is why she has been crowned women's Ballon d'Or winner for an unprecedented third time.

While Spain were unable to add to their World Cup triumph two years earlier, it was still another spectacular season for the Barcelona midfielder, who won a domestic treble with her club and also reached the Champions League final.

The 2024-25 campaign was one without either of the biggest prizes for club or country with Bonmati, yet it was successful nevertheless.

She was once again vital to Barcelona, netting 12 times and assisting a further six goals in the league.

It may not have been an unblemished season in the league for her club, but they still finished eight points ahead of second-placed Real Madrid.

In the Champions League she shone - despite Barcelona being unable to retain their title and losing the final to Arsenal.

Bonmati was named the competition's player of the season by Uefa, registering nine goal contributions in her 11 appearances and scoring in their 4-1 semi-final second-leg win at Chelsea.

Once again, her world-class quality was evident.

Understandably, suffering from a bout of viral meningitis just days before the tournament began meant it was not a perfect Euros for Bonmati.

Yet, after returning, she helped make history.

Bonmati had almost missed the tournament, but came back and scored the winner in extra time as Spain beat Germany to reach the final.

"Scoring in a game like this one is super special. If I can help the team write history, it's very special," she said.

Sometimes, it takes a player of Bonmati's calibre to make the difference in the pivotal moments - and that is what she did, getting the all-important goal in a knockout stage which was otherwise somewhat muted.

Despite winning the World Cup in 2023, Spain had never made it to a final of a Euros. Having arrived as favourites, losing on penalties to England meant it was far from ideal for her country, but that does not detract from the incredible story of her comeback.

Aitana Bonmati has helped Barcelona become Spanish champions on three occasions and European champions three times, although they lost to Arsenal in the 2024-25 Champions League final

Bonmati's list of accolades is a lengthy one.

She has now won the Ballon d'Or in 2023, 2024 and 2025, and was the Fifa Best women's player in 2023 and 2024.

She has been crowned the Champions League player of the season three times and won the competition as many times.

Her trophy haul with Barcelona is impressive - seven league titles, three European crowns, nine Copas de la Reina and five Spanish Super Cups.

The La Masia graduate is undoubtedly one of the best to play the game.

Let's dive into the details: Dutchman Daan Hoole celebrated his stage 10 win beneath Pisa's iconic Leaning Tower

Dutchman Daan Hoole secured his first GrandÂ TourÂ stageÂ win as he beat Great Britain's Josh Tarling in the time trial on stage 10 of the Giro d'Italia in Pisa.

Juan Ayuso finished 22nd, over a minute and half down, but cut UAE Team Emirates -XRG team-mate Isaac del Toro's lead in the general classification to 25 seconds.

Lidl-Trek rider Hoole finished seven seconds clear of Ineos Grenadiers' Tarling with a time of 32 minutes and 30 seconds, with British national road champion Ethan Hayter, 26, 10 seconds back on Hoole in third.

Tarling, 21, was the pre-stage favourite after winning the first time trial of the race on stage two, but he was unable to match the performance of Hoole over the 28 kilometre course between Lucca and Pisa on Tuesday. 

"I'mÂ soÂ happyÂ andÂ thereÂ areÂ soÂ manyÂ peopleÂ IÂ needÂ toÂ thank.Â IÂ justÂ can'tÂ believeÂ it," said 26-year-old Hoole, who took advantage of dry roads before torrential rain hamperedÂ theÂ laterÂ starters, who were the general classification contenders. 

Race leader Del Toro of Mexico finished inÂ 37thÂ place, two minutes 22 seconds behind Hoole, but retained the pink jersey. 

Briton Simon Yates of Visma-Lease a Bike moved up two places in the standings to fourth after placing 23rd. 

OverallÂ race favouriteÂ PrimozÂ Roglic of Slovenia, who lost time after a crash on Sunday, finished one minute 15 secondsÂ downÂ onÂ Hoole in 17th place. 

But the 2023 Giro champion made up time on all his main rivals and now sits fifth overall, one minute 18 seconds behind Del Toro.

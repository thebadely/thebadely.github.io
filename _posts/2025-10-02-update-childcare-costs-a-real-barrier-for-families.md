Let's dive into the details: Parents and carers have told the government childcare is too expensive and difficult to secure.

A survey completed by 1,250 people in Jersey showed 95% found the affordability of childcare was poor or very poor and 79% said there were not enough places.

Ministers have announced plans to invest Â£4m in childcare but nursery owners have expressed concerns about the cost and the lack of staff to deliver it.

Education Minister deputy Rob Ward, who published the survey, said "evidence is clear that the cost of childcare is a real barrier for families" and he was committed to making it more affordable and accessible.

The research was commissioned for the government's Early Years Common Strategic Policy for the 2024 to 2026 period.

The findings showed the three main barriers to being able to access childcare were affordability, availability and flexibility.

It also found enabling employment and supporting child development were the two key motivators for parents and carers. 

Ward said the report would help the government shape a system that "gives every child the best start in life".

"As minister, this is something I care deeply about," he said.

"I have listened to parents and carers across Jersey and I recognise the challenges they face."

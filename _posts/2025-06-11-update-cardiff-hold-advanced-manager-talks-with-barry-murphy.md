Let's dive into the details: Brian Barry-Murphy is the son of Gaelic sports great Jimmy Barry-Murphy

Cardiff City have held advanced talks with former Manchester City academy coach Brian Barry-Murphy as they close in on naming a new manager.

The 46-year-old Leicester City assistant is now the leading contender for the vacancy at the League One club.

Former Oxford United boss Des Buckingham has also been in the frame with admirers among the Bluebirds' hierarchy.

The development follows setbacks in attempts to land Charlton Athletic's Nathan Jones, while Aaron Ramsey has also appeared to rule himself out of contention.

Wales captain Ramsey had taken temporary charge as Cardiff were relegated from the Championship last month, Omer Riza having been sacked with three games of the season remaining.

But while it is not clear if a final decision has been made, Barry-Murphy is now the frontrunner to land a first senior manager's position since leaving Rochdale in 2021.

He would become the Bluebirds' ninth manager in four years as they prepare to play in the third tier for the first time since 2003.

The Irishman has been on Cardiff's radar for some time having been under consideration to replace Mick McCarthy in 2021.

Cardiff had been criticised by fans â including the club's Supporters' Trust â for the prolonged process in finding a new manager.

Responding in a statement, director Steve Borley said: "While initially the plan was to have the manager, and his staff, in place before now, the correct due diligence, however long it took, was essential to the ongoing success of the club. This is one of the most important appointments in Cardiff City's recent history.

"We've been immensely impressed by the standard of those who wish to lead our football club. We are excited to share a further positive update soon regarding the appointment of a new management team once the necessary negotiations have been concluded."

Barry-Murphy is a former midfielder with Cork City, Preston North End, Sheffield Wednesday, Bury and Rochdale, becoming player-coach at the latter in 2014 at the age of 35.

He succeeded Keith Hill as manager in 2019, winning praise for the side's style of play and work with homegrown talent despite the team's relegation to League Two in 2021.

Barry-Murphy resigned from the job to take to take up the role at Manchester City's academy, succeeding future Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca and winning two youth titles, coaching the likes of Cole Palmer, Oscar Bobb and Romeo Lavia while working under Pep Guardiola.

After quitting the Etihad three years later, Barry-Murphy went on to be named as part of Ruud van Nistelrooy's backroom staff at Leicester in December 2024.

But Barry-Murphy had been keen for a frontline role of his own and could now be handed the challenge of returning Cardiff to the Championship.

Buckingham, who guided Oxford to League One promotion in May 2024, has also held talks with Cardiff.

The 40-year-old is currently without a club having left the Kassam Stadium in December following a poor run of results.

Buckingham, who previously coached in New Zealand and managed City Football Group clubs Melbourne City and Mumbai City, had previously been under consideration by the Football Association of Wales (FAW) before the appointment of Craig Bellamy as national boss.

Both Barry-Murphy and Buckingham were on a shortlist of around six names compiled by a specially formed sub-committee, with owner Vincent Tan having a final say on the appointment.

Charlton's Jones, a former Cardiff youth player and a boyhood supporter of the club, had been a leading contender.

But Cardiff were left frustrated in their hopes of landing the Welshman after he led the Addicks to League One promotion via the play-offs, signing a new five-year deal after initial approaches were rebuffed.

Ramsey â whose playing contract at Cardiff expires at the end of the month â had been seemingly close to the job at one stage, but now looks set to continue his career on the pitch.

Former Bolton Wanderers manager Ian Evatt is also thought to have been interviewed for the role.

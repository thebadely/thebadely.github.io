According to new developments, Shaun Harvey became chief executive of the English Football League in 2013

Wrexham's non-executive director Shaun Harvey labelled aspects of the speculation surrounding Phil Parkinson's future at the club as "an absolute disgrace".

A report claimed talks had been held among the Championship club's hierarchy over the 57-year-old manager's situation as a result of Wrexham's disappointing start to the 2025-26 season.

But Harvey rubbished those claims, adding that Parkinson has the full support of all of the key decision makers at the Stok Cae Ras.

"It's an absolute disgrace," Harvey told the Fearless in Devotion, external podcast of speculation around Parkinson's future.

"I think we're all disappointed we've not got more than four points at this moment in time. But to start quoting discussions and meetings that have taken place is the bit that's the disgrace."

Parkinson plays down reports on Wrexham future talks

Wrexham's 3-1 loss to Queens Park Rangers last time out was their third defeat in five league matches in the second tier - with Parkinson's men sitting 21st in the Championship going into Saturday's trip to Norwich City (15:00 BST).

But Harvey said the club would not panic as Wrexham bid to improve their fortunes.

He added: "Phil has everybody at the club's full support. I know before somebody starts writing headlines, 'Harvey gives Parkinson the vote of confidence'. That is not the vote of confidence. 

"What I'm saying is, he's got our full support. You can only give somebody a vote of confidence when you've actually discussed the future. It's not even been on anywhere near an agenda as yet. 

"So, if that day comes, the decision has to be taken. But Phil's our man. 

"We've backed him from the start. We backed him from four years ago. We've had all the success under that regime. Why should we start panicking now?"

On the back of securing three successive promotions, Wrexham brought in 13 players during the summer transfer window for their first season in the second tier since 1981-82.

But Harvey says the hefty squad overhaul was necessary given the club's dramatic rise up the football pyramid.

"It was seismic in terms of what we did," said Harvey.

"Usually clubs have seismic change such as that because there's a problem. Of course, ours was created for exactly the opposite reason and that being our success."

According to new developments, Iga Swiatek has now won six Grand Slam titles

Wimbledon 2025

Venue: All England Club Dates: 30 June-13 July

If history has taught us anything about Iga Swiatek, it is that once she breaks her opponent's serve a dominant victory is on the cards.

That is what happened in Saturday's Wimbledon final as she claimed the title for the first time with a ruthless 57-minute 6-0 6-0 victory over Amanda Anisimova.

It was undoubtedly tough on the American, but she is not alone in being on the receiving end of such a result.

In 2021 Swiatek beat former world number one Karolina Pliskova by the same scoreline in the Italian Open final. 

This year alone, 12 players have lost a set 6-0 to Swiatek, including Dayana Yastremska (twice), Emma Raducanu, Belinda Bencic and Victoria Azarenka.

At January's Australian Open, Swiatek registered 6-0 sets in three of her first four matches - and now those same scorelines are appearing on the grass courts.

"Coming here, I could really focus on getting better and developing as a player rather than everybody just asking me to win," Poland's Swiatek said.

"I kind of enjoyed that because expectations were a bit lower."

The rarity of a 6-0 6-0 scoreline in a final underlines Swiatek's dominance.

This is the first 6-0 6-0 win in a Grand Slam final since Steffi Graff beat Natasha Zvereva in just 34 minutes at the 1988 French Open. 

It is the first time it has been done in a Wimbledon final in the Open era, which is when tennis became professional. In 1911, Dorothea Lambert Chambers beat Dora Boothby by the same scoreline - but that was in the challenge match era, where the defending champion played just once.

Swiatek is also just the fourth player in the Open era to win the first set of the Wimbledon women's singles final with a 6-0 scoreline after Billie Jean King (1973, 1975), Chris Evert (1974) and Martina Navratilova (1983).

Swiatek broke to love in the very first game of the match and it was clear she was in clinical form as Anisimova struggled with nerves.

Eighth seed Swiatek did not face a single break point, won 21 of 29 points on her first serve and five out of eight on her second.

It keeps Swiatek's outstanding record in major finals going - she has won 12 and lost just one set in her six Slam finals.

Swiatek was helped along the way by the mistakes Anisimova made as the pressure of playing in a first Grand Slam final told.

The American made 28 unforced errors compared with just 11 for Swiatek and double-faulted five times. 

Anisimova said after the match her serve is something she can work on.

"I've struggled with my serve, as most people probably can tell by the looks of it and the statistics," she said.

Anisimova hit 41 double faults over the two weeks at Wimbledon - 17 more than any other player in the women's singles draw.

Across all the players on the WTA Tour she ranks ninth for the most double faults in 2025, with 149 in 35 matches.

In 1974, American Chris Evert beat Russian Olga Morozova 6-0 6-4 to comfortably win the first of her three Wimbledon titles.

In 1975, American Billie Jean King won her sixth and final Wimbledon singles title, beating Australian Evonne Goolagong Cawley 6-0 6-1 in just 38 minutes.

In 1983, Martina Navratilova claimed a thumping 6-0 6-3 victory over fellow American Andrea Jaeger for her fourth title and second in a row.

In 1992, Germany's Steffi Graf saw off Yugoslavian teenager Monica Seles 6-2 6-1 for the fourth of her seven titles.

In 2014, Czech Petra Kvitova thrashed Canada's Eugenie Bouchard 6-3 6-0 in just 55 minutes.

In tennis a 6-0 scoreline is nicknamed a bagel, while a 6-1 win is a breadstick. 

Swiatek wins so many sets by those scorelines that in the past few years, fans have nicknamed those results 'Iga's bakery'.

She has won 32 sets by a 6-0 scoreline in Grand Slam matches, with three of those coming at Wimbledon this year.

That doubled her tally from all her previous matches at the Championships, emphasising her improvement on grass.

"I think winning on the grass is proving that she can win on every surface," former Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli said on BBC Radio 5 Live.

"It gives her that new platform in her career because for a very long time she was seen as only a clay-court player. 

"She got the US Open title under her belt and now winning at Wimbledon in that kind of fashion adds another extra layer to her resume."

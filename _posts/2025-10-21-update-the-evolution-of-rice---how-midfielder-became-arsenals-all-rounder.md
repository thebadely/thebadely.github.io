Let's dive into the details: Declan Rice joined Arsenal from West Ham for Â£105m in 2023

Declan Rice is widely regarded as one of the best central midfielders in the Premier League, but his role for the Gunners now is very different from the one he played in when he arrived at the club.

When Rice signed for Arsenal from West Ham for Â£105m in 2023, he spent the first six months as a more traditional holding midfielder, before he moved to a box-to-box role following a winter training camp in January 2024.

That change brought an increase in his attacking numbers, helped by him taking set-pieces, and he carried that into last season as the 26-year-old produced a career-best campaign for goal contributions with nine goals and 10 assists.

Arsenal, who have finished second for the past three seasons, added Spain international Martin Zubimendi to their midfield for Â£60m this summer as they look to go one better and win the title.

Zubimendi is one of the best deep-lying midfielders in Europe and has allowed Rice to continue his move to a fully fledged box-to-box midfielder - but in a slightly different way.

The Spaniard's presence has actually meant Rice taking up a deeper position alongside him, but in a role that allows the Englishman to use his running power to join Arsenal attacks.

He leads the way for Arsenal this season on total ball carries (147), passes played into the box (57) and chances created (level with Bukayo Saka on 13).

Rice's recent performances have prompted former Gunners captain Patrick Vieira to describe him as a "complete midfielder", external.

Arsenal, who host Atletico Madrid in the Champions League on Tuesday (20:00 BST), have changed their style this season to be more direct and play through defensive lines quicker, which has meant Rice moving deeper alongside Zubimendi when starting attacks.

A recruitment specialist working in top level football told BBC Sport how the signing of Zubimendi has complemented Rice's game.

He said: "It hasn't changed what he can do as he has done it before, but it [Zubimendi's arrival] has given him more ability to be an all-rounder.

"He already had the ability to contribute in the holding game but now he is able to excel in attacking phases.

"His ability to take the ball on the half-turn allows his first touch to be always forward when he receives it.

"The attacking role hasn't phased him. He has grasped it really well and you can tell it's something he's always had." 

Rice already has three assists and one goal in his 11 games for Arsenal this season.

For his goal against West Ham, Rice arrived late into the box to meet a bouncing ball and finish well to score Arsenal's opener in their 2-0 win.

And the recruitment specialist believes Rice, though known for his running ability, does not get the plaudits he deserves.

"A lot of people don't really give him the credit he is due for his athleticism," he said. "He is extremely athletic and a good mover.

"He has the freedom to create in the attacking area of the pitch, he is excellent in holding, he is such a fluent player and performs with the freedom he has been given.

"A good player, good passing, but can also be gritty and break up play. He is a commanding midfield player.

"I like the fact that he can dictate the tempo of the game. Really good precision in his actions. He has transitioned seamlessly to a box-to-box player."

The national team are benefitting from Rice's evolution too.

England manager Thomas Tuchel has also released Rice into a more forward position with Elliot Anderson taking up the number six role to make the most of the Arsenal midfielder's running power.

"It's a hot topic!" Rice said after the 3-0 win over Wales at Wembley when asked by BBC Sport about his position.

"It doesn't bother me. I think now I'm more of a box-to-box number eight.

"The manager [Arteta] has adjusted my position at Arsenal a bit this year to give me a bit more freedom to drop deeper but to also get in the box when I can, and it's the same with Thomas [Tuchel].

"That really suits me on the left side of midfield - being able to get back. An all- round-action midfielder is what I want to be."

Rice complimented both Tuchel and Arteta for giving him the confidence to play in a more advanced role.

"When you have confidence in football you feel unstoppable at times and I think I ended the season really strong," he said.

"I probably didn't start the first one or two games of this season as good as I wanted but I have picked up my form now.

"I feel really strong, I feel fit, I feel really confident in my game. Hopefully the only way is up from here with England and Arsenal."

An analyst from a rival Premier League team has also noticed the changes in how Arsenal and Rice play.

He told BBC Sport: "It seems like they're more of a 4-2-3-1 in their build-up than last year, where they were a 4-3-3 [with Rice playing as the left number eight].

"I would agree his role is a little more hybrid where he is starting deeper during build-ups, but then joining in the attacks in a higher position further up the pitch [box-to-box].

"Most top teams want to create an overload against the opposition's defensive line, so against teams that play with a back four they will want five players on their attacking line."

An example of this is when Arsenal pushed Riccardo Calafiori higher against Manchester City and moved Leandro Trossard into a pocket of space off the left wing.

"That has meant that they've kept Rice deeper alongside Zubimendi and played in a 3-2-5 shape in possession.

"Arsenal are constantly adjusting what they do though, so in some games they'll play the left-back inverted alongside the defensive midfielder, but essentially still creating a 3-2-5 shape - but this would result in Rice pushing higher in the left pocket."

Arsenal have enjoyed an excellent start to the season, conceding just three goals, keeping eight clean sheets and only losing once in their first 11 matches. They sit three points clear of Manchester City at the top of the Premier League after eight games.

Arteta is hoping to go one step better after three successive second-placed league finishes - and Rice's performances will be a big part of making that happen.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Two Margate women who were diagnosed with breast cancer are urging people to understand the symptoms and have the courage to stand up for themselves if their concerns have been disregarded by doctors.

Eve Ross, who is a nursery worker in Kent, went to her doctor after she discovered a small lump in her armpit in January 2024.

The 26-year-old told the BBC she was informed it was just a cyst, but in three months the tumour had grown "into the size of a golf ball". She said the doctor dismissed it as inflammation.

"I was in so much pain at night, I was screaming," she said. "But the doctor wouldn't give me pain medication despite how much pain I was in."

Ms Ross said she "couldn't sleep" and had to go to A&E. 

She said it had taken five months and four doctors before she was diagnosed with stage two breast cancer. 

Ms Ross said she underwent six rounds of chemotherapy, a double mastectomy and radiotherapy.

Although she is now cancer-free, she said she felt "betrayed" by some of the medical professionals she dealt with.

"I feel angry, that's the main reason why I want to get my story out there," she said. 

"You know your body, so push your doctors if you feel there's something wrong. 

"If they don't listen, look for someone else because that's what I had to do. I wish I had done it sooner."

Victoria Riley-Sanford was diagnosed with breast cancer this year. 

The 31-year-old said she found a little lump in her breast and went to see a doctor. 

"The doctor couldn't feel the lump and told me it was hormonal," she said. 

Ms Riley-Sanford said medical staff still dismissed her concerns during an scan until she "kicked a tantrum" and was "in tears".

She said two weeks later she was told she had breast cancer, and underwent a single mastectomy. 

"I feel relieved I have had the surgery. It's life changing," she said.

She added she was "disappointed" it had taken five months for her concerns to be heard.

According to Breast Cancer UK, about 56,000 women and men are diagnosed with breast cancer every year.

Symptoms include lumps in chest, breast or armpit, changes in the shape of breast, redness, rashes or texture changes and any pain that does not go away.

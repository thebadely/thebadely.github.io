Let's dive into the details: Aoife Wafer took part in Ireland's training session on Wednesday 

Ireland assistant coach Alex Codling says star back row Aoife Wafer is "very close" to making her return from knee injury.

This year's Women's Six Nations player of the tournament missed Ireland's opening World Cup win over Japan after undergoing knee surgery last month.

Wafer stayed in Dublin last week to continue her rehab, and while she has trained with the squad since arriving in England, Codling stopped short of saying the 22-year-old is in contention to face Spain in Northampton on Sunday (12:00 BST).

"She's working really hard, she's coming back, she's very close," said Codling.

"Obviously as a coaching group it's important we make sure that moment's right for her and for the team. We'll monitor that over the next couple of days."

Codling added: "I'm not working directly with her, but in terms of running, she joined in with the lineouts, that gives an indication that she's on track and going really well."

Codling also said Ireland are "looking after" Edel McMahon after the co-captain sat out part of Wednesday's training session. 

Having missed both warm-up games, McMahon managed 75 minutes in the win over Japan. 

"It's important for us as a coaching group, we're managing loads of players and she's obviously been out for a while," explained Codling.  

"She was exceptional at the weekend so we're looking after her and making sure she is fit and ready."

Spain opened their World Cup campaign with a 54-8 loss to holders New Zealand, but ran Ireland close in their WXV3 meeting in 2023 after winning the 2021 World Cup qualifier between the sides. 

Spain are ranked 13th in the world, eight places below Ireland, but Codling insists "a piece of paper has never won games". 

"I think we treat everyone the same, for lots of different reasons. Certainly, they are a team that will challenge us. 

"They have got a lot of Sevens players in the group, and you could see against New Zealand, if you give them space and time they will hurt you."

It has been recently reported that Chancellor Rachel Reeves features on many of the front pages after she warned voters about the "necessary" choices to be made at this month's Budget to balance the books.

The Financial Times says she has "opened the door" for a "manifesto-breaking income tax rise".

The i Paper highlights that such a hike would be the first since 1975, and break what the paper calls a "50-year taboo" against the policy.

The Daily Mail labels the chancellor's Downing Street speech on Tuesday as "all bluster" and a "waffle bomb".

According to the Daily Telegraph, some within Labour have been left fearing the worst. An unnamed Labour MP tells the paper they believe putting up taxes will "scotch whatever limited chances" the party has of being re-elected, and that breaking the manifesto pledge could leave them with "no credibility".

The Times says ministers have raised concerns that an increase in income tax could see them lose some voters "forever".

The front page of the Metro has a photograph of the rail worker, Samir Zitouni, who protected passengers during the knife attack on a train in Cambridgeshire on Saturday. More details were released about him yesterday. The paper quotes his family who say "he's always been a hero".

The Daily Telegraph reports that Sir Keir Starmer's deal to hand over sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius has been delayed. The paper says it is because a Conservative peer submitted an amendment to the legislation, to try to make the government consult the Chagossians before going ahead.

A Foreign Office spokesman said there had been a lack of notice given regarding the amendment, and a Lords vote to confirm the Bill would be moved to a later date.

And most of the papers feature photographs of Sir David Beckham receiving his knighthood at Windsor Castle yesterday. "Bend a knee like Beckham" says the Daily Mirror while the Daily Mail goes for: "Arise Sir Becks."

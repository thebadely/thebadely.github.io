It has been recently reported that As a former police detective, I've attended many car accidents but this summer, for the first time, I was in a head-on collision with another car myself. 

Being directly involved in one of the more than 900 car accidents that happen in the UK every day gave me a different perspective.

The woman in the other car, in her early seventies, had a medical episode while driving and swerved straight into my lane and hit me.

At the time, I didn't know any of that - I just remember a huge bang and then everything felt like a blur. 

The next thing I knew, two men were at the side of the car trying to get me out. I couldn't move. I was taken to the hospital for scans but amazingly, I got away with cuts and bruises.

I was very lucky, and the witnesses at the scene were so important because without them, I wouldn't have understood what had actually happened.

Here are some of the key things I've now learnt about what to do in the immediate aftermath of an accident.

Be mindful of what you say at the scene - both to the other driver and to people around you. 

It might feel natural to apologise, even if it's not your fault, but saying "I'm sorry" can sometimes be taken as an admission of guilt. 

Immediately after an accident, stop your car and turn the engine off - you're actually committing an offence if you don't stop after a collision. Then check yourself and your passengers for injuries. 

If the cars involved can still move, and the road is clear, try to get your vehicle to a safe place nearby and switch on your hazard lights. If that's not possible, leave it where it is and stand well back from the traffic.

Call 999 if someone is injured, if the other party drives away or if someone is causing a road block.

Make sure you exchange details with the other driver. Take down their name, address, contact details and insurance information.

You can also gather contact details from witnesses, as their statements can be critical later.

It's important to inform your insurer as soon as possible, ideally within 24 hours. 

It's always a good idea to record as much evidence as possible, even if it's clearly the other party's fault. 

Capture photos of the damage and entire scene. 

Stand at a distance to show the full layout, including the position of cars, road signs, weather, skid marks and surroundings.

Also look for CCTV on nearby buildings, shops, or public roads that may have captured the incident.

Making as many notes as possible is helpful to remember exactly what happened. 

Some of the vital details to get down are the time and date of the crash, as well as the registration, make, model and colour of all vehicles involved.

Write down any injuries you or other passengers have sustained.

Anything else you remember such as direction of travel, road name, your speed and any unusual behaviour can also be helpful. 

My final piece of advice relates to dashcams, which are incredibly useful. 

They provide clear, time-stamped video evidence of what happened in an accident, which can quickly resolve disputes with insurers or the police. 

They can also capture dangerous driving or road conditions, helping to protect you from false claims.

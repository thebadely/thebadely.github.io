According to new developments, Spoiler warning: This article reveals details from the second episode of The Celebrity Traitors

The second episode of The Celebrity Traitors has taken place, and Tom Daley giving Kate Garraway a serious side-eye Was one of the moments that got viewers talking.

The TV presenter is suspect #1 for the Olympic diver, who made zero efforts to hide it during Thursday night's show.

At one point, Garraway declares she is "flabbergasted" by the first murder. Daley, 31, has no time for it, giving a major eye roll.

"Who uses that word?" he asks.

"You can't just call someone a Traitor because they have a better vocabulary than you," replies comedian Alan Carr, 49.

But Daley's not the only one who thinks Garraway could be a Traitor.

Throughout the episode, Garraway was accused both by her fellow contestants and by fans online of "over-acting". 

"Kate Garraway is coming across so suspicious and being so over the top. Even I'm starting to think she's secretly a Traitor and I know she isn't," wrote one X user.

For entertainment reporter Indigo Stafford, the behaviour seemed to suggest Garraway, 58, was hiding something.

Spoiler: she was not.

She's a faithful. But when her name was repeatedly brought up by the other celebrities at the roundtable, Garraway was forced to explain herself.

Apparently, that's just how she is. "I'm a massive ham," she said.

Garraway wasn't the only one struggling with her acting skills.

Alan Carr - the standout sensation of episode one - was still finding it hard to keep a straight face.

As the first episode of the Celebrity Traitors drew to a close on Wednesday night, we were left waiting to find out which star would be murdered by Carr in plain sight.

Would he go through with it? Our hearts, collectively as a nation, were in our mouths.

But murder, he did. And not just any murder. He selected singer Paloma Faith, who by his own admission is one of his "best friends".

The following morning at breakfast, as the rest of the players tried to work out what had happened, he was all over the place - scratching his head nervously, biting his fingers.

"It was a stretch for my acting ability, I don't know how Meryl Streep does it," he said.

And then we had Jonathan Ross - a traitor - vowing dramatically to avenge Faith. "It was massive graveside overacting," said TV journalist Siobhan Synnot.

They may be celebrities, but even so they're not immune from feeling the nerves - and that could explain their poor acting abilities, says Stafford.

You can see why "being in a game set around murder, betrayal and manipulation... would jangle your nerves," she explained.

Elsewhere, fans online were relieved to know that celebrities are as bad at spelling as previous contestants.

When Niko Omilana voted for Tom Daley, he spelled it “DAYLEE”.

"Niko keeping the longstanding Traitors tradition of terrible name spelling at the round table alive and well," wrote one X user, adding: "It's officially Tom Daylee now, any other spelling will not be accepted."

Others said the spelling error was giving Minah vibes, after a player from season three had to correct others for spelling her name as "Mina".

The celebrities‘ fashion sense is also causing a bit of a stir.

Ross didn't hold back - with his fur-trimmed jacket and sunnies in the pouring rain for a funeral scene.

The verdict was mixed, with one X user saying he has the best wardrobe, while another argued he looks like "your least favourite aunty".

Poor poisoned Paloma, meanwhile, told Traitors Uncloaked on BBC Two that she felt sad to be out - not only because of having more to give the show, but also because she had lots of outfits planned.

The show ended on a cliffhanger - again - with fans having to wait till next week to find out who has been voted out.

And that, too, is causing a stir online.

"So we won't be won't know who gets banished until Wednesday?? As in 7 days???", wrote one X user, while others simply put a string of crying emojis.

The Celebrity Traitors is on BBC One on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:00 BST and on BBC iPlayer. There will be nine episodes.

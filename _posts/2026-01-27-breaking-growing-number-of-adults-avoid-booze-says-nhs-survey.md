Experts revealed that Almost a quarter of adults in England do not drink alcohol, according to new figures from a government-backed NHS health survey. 

The data suggests that young people, and increasing numbers of men in particular, are shunning booze.

The latest data from the Health Survey for England for 2024 suggests 24% of adults said they haven't drunk alcohol in the previous year.

But far fewer older people abstain from alcohol and those who do drink, are likely to do so at more dangerous levels.

Between 2011 and 2022, the number of adults who claimed not to drink alcohol had been fairly stable, at around 19% – almost one in five. 

But these figures suggest that figure has risen, with almost a quarter of adults saying they haven't drunk alcohol in the past year. 

Age and sex are playing a significant part in attitudes towards booze. 

Some 39% of young men say they had abstained from alcohol. This compares to around 16% of men aged 65 and older, who say they don't drink. 

Among women, 31% - almost a third of those aged 16 to 24 - are non drinkers. 

But for older women aged 55 to 64, just 17% - fewer than one in five - don't drink. 

And of those who do consume alcohol – both men and women – older people aged 65 to 74 are almost twice as likely to do so at risky levels compared to younger people aged 25 to 34.

Income also plays a role, with people living in more deprived areas tending to drink less than their more affluent neighbours.

The NHS recommends not drinking more than 14 units of alcohol a week and spreading intake over three or more days.

One unit of alcohol is 10ml of pure alcohol, which is equivalent to half a pint of normal-strength lager or a single measure (25ml) of spirits.

A small glass of wine contains about 1.5 units, a standard glass is 2.1 and a bottle of wine contains 10 units.

Meanwhile, a can of lager, beer or cider is two units. 

A pint is two or three units, depending on whether it is lower or higher strength.

Campaigners say that while it is encouraging that fewer people are undertaking risky drinking, millions are still consuming alcohol at levels that could threaten their health.

Jem Roberts, head of external affairs at the Institute of Alcohol Studies, says this latest survey shouldn't distract from the scale of alcohol harm in England.

"Millions of people are still drinking at levels that significantly increase their risk of serious harm, from alcohol-related cancers to life-changing injuries and long-term illness, and we have seen record high alcohol deaths in recent years," he said.

The most effective way to reduce the record number of alcohol deaths is through measures such as minimum unit pricing, clear health warnings on alcohol labels, restrictions on alcohol availability, and comprehensive bans on alcohol marketing, he added.

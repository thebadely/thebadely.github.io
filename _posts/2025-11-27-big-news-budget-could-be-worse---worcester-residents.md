It has been recently reported that People in Worcester have shared mixed views about the chancellor's Budget - with some residents criticising tax rises as others insisted "the worst-off" would benefit. 

Rachel Reeves on Wednesday revealed a plan that scrapped the two-child benefit cap and could also see people paying more tax across several criteria. She called on "ordinary people" to do their bit for the economy. 

At a weekly community kitchen in Worcester, where people on low incomes can get a free meal, residents have had their say.

"Some of the Budget was ok," said working grandmother Roni Skye. "But I don't agree with the child benefit cap being lifted - at the end of the day all working people will have to pay for that."

She added: "If people are really struggling, [removing the cap is} great - but some people will abuse the system and pop out more children because they know they'll get more money. 

"It's another excuse for the younger generation not to work." 

Pensioner Graham Key, who is in his 70s, said: "A 4.8 per cent increase on pensions will be a great benefit for me. 

"And it's a good Budget for parents with more than two children - but I realise somebody has to pay for it. 

"Is it a fair Budget? Well it helps the worst-off. But I don't think any Budget can be 'fair' - most working people will end up paying extra taxes." 

Other people bemoaned the move to bring in a tax for electric vehicles - and the prospect of a fuel duty rise in 2027. 

Hannah Kryszewski, an actor, said: "I'm a bit upset about what [the chancellor] has done to motorists. 

"Overall the Budget is ok but for car users it's going to be more expensive - that's thrown me somewhat." 

Keiron Doyle added: "I think it's good that they've kept rail fares at the same price, and increased the taxes on smoking and alcohol. 

"All of that is really good. I'm not sure about the other taxes though - if you tax people too much it's not great for working people." 

The chancellor has said the biggest tax burden would fall on those "with the broadest shoulders" through higher taxes on property and savings, including a new tax on homes worth more than £2m.

The Conservatives said she should resign for breaking promises on tax, while Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said Rachel Reeves was now taxing "ordinary people to record levels".

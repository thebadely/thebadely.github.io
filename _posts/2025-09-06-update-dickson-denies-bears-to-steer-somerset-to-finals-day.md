Let's dive into the details: Sean Dickson has hit three half-centuries for Somerset in this year's T20 Blast

Vitality Blast quarter-final, Taunton

Bears 190-6 (20 overs): Davies 71; Green 2-30

Somerset 191-6 (19.5 overs): Dickson 71*, Abell 51; Hannon-Dalby 3-24

Somerset won by four wickets

Scorecard

Sean Dickson carried Somerset to a record-equalling 11th appearance at T20 Blast finals day as the Bears' quarter-final curse struck again on a nail-biting night under the Taunton lights.

Requiring 19 to win from the final over, Dickson hit Ed Barnard for two sixes and a four to get his side over the line with one ball remaining and earn a semi-final against Lancashire.

A Somerset victory had looked unlikely, with the 34-year-old arriving at the crease at 80-3 with 11 runs per over required but he first supported Tom Abell (51) before taking centre stage with his unbeaten 71 coming from just 26 balls.

Bears had looked on course to finally win a last-eight tie after four successive defeats when posting 190-6, with skipper Alex Davies making 71 and Rob Yates smacking the tournament's leading wicket-taker Riley Meredith for six successive boundaries, only for Dickson to deny them at the death.

Bears captain Alex Davies saw his side fall to a fifth successive quarter-final defeat

Fielding a side with no overseas player, and with Olly Hannon-Dalby playing his first game in the Blast since 2023, Bears arrived in the south west very much as underdogs but they made full use of the good early batting conditions.

When Davies struck the final ball of Craig Overton's opening over for four it started a sequence of nine successive boundaries, with Rob Yates (25) hammering 24 from Australian paceman Meredith's first set of six.

The 18 fours hit by the visitors in the powerplay created a new tournament record, as they raced to 82-1 from the opening six overs.

Davies made 71 from only 39 balls, with 13 fours, but when he became one of Ben Green's (2-30) two victims the Bears lost momentum, with only 63 runs coming from the final 8.3 overs - and for the first time in Blast history a side failed to hit a six in a completed T20 innings at Taunton

Somerset found the early stages of their innings tougher going than their opponents, with the home crowd unusually subdued as their team lost wickets at regular intervals.

When Dickson joined Abell at the wicket the home side still required a further 111 runs from under 10 overs, and when the latter fell for 51 with 57 still needed, their hopes of a third title seemed to be slipping away.

Hannon-Dalby (3-24) bowled superbly despite a lack of match time in the format, but the South African was keeping Somerset in the game while wickets fell at the other end.

He doggedly got them to the final over still in with a chance and, when Barnard opened with a wide and Craig Overton then scrambled a single, Dickson produced his late fireworks to send Somerset to a fifth straight Finals Day.

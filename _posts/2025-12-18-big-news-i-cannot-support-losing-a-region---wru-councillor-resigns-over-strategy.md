Let's dive into the details: Anthony Buchanan made his senior Wales debut against Tonga in 1987

Former Wales and Llanelli prop Anthony Buchanan says he has no confidence in the Welsh Rugby Union's executive board after resigning from the governing body's council.

His departure comes amid the current uncertainty regarding the future structure of Welsh rugby.

The WRU announced in October it planned to reduce the number of professional men's sides in Wales from four to three.

The Wales men's senior side has lost 21 out of its past 23 matches and suffered a record 73-0 home defeat against South Africa at the end of November.

When asked whether he had confidence in the WRU board, Buchanan replied: "No".

In response to Buchanan's criticism the WRU said they are "making positive changes" to the structure of the professional game in Wales. 

A union statement added: "We know this process will present challenges, but the board has confidence in the decisions it has made and in our plans for the future. 

"Our role is to implement a change for the good of the whole system in Wales for the long term and we remain dedicated to this aim."

The WRU council is responsible for setting the strategy for community rugby in Wales.

It consists of five national council members along with 14 district council members, elected by member clubs.

Buchanan say he has not taken the decision lightly.

"It has been a pleasure to serve the WRU over the last 11 years," Buchanan told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast.

"I was hoping to use my experiences and my knowledge of the game to perhaps influence the direction of travel.

"I feel very uncomfortable now. Rugby has been in the heart of Wales for many years but I also know we're on the brink of losing our culture and our identity.

"I can't trade that off for what basically happens next. I no longer could support the direction of travel. What I had to do was look at myself and what I believed in."

Abject failure becoming the norm - where does Welsh rugby go from here?

WRU Q&A: Why drastic change is needed

Welsh rugby's governing body has said it proposes to grant three licences for men's professional clubs.

There will be one in Cardiff, one in the east and one in the west, which is expected to result in a straight survival fight between Swansea-based Ospreys and Scarlets in Llanelli.

Buchanan does not agree with the reduction in the number of sides after he pointed to the initial previous change in 2003 from clubs to regions. 

"We came from our clubs to our regions and those were big steps," said Buchanan.

"We had success on the field with Triple Crown, Grand Slams and Six Nations Championships in that era.

"The Scarlets, Cardiff, Ospreys, were all successful stories. So what brings me to this is what's happened and how have we arrived here?"

The 70-year-old went on:

"What are we going to do to bring ourselves back into being a top tier one country?

"The next step made will be crucial. And I cannot support that next step in taking one of our top regions out."

Buchanan believes losing Ospreys or Scarlets will be detrimental to the Welsh game.

"Whichever one goes, it's going to be devastating," he said.

"The Ospreys stretch from Bridgend, or Cardiff, down to Swansea and the Scarlets are down to the west with a new stadium and everything.

"I don't see the decision being a step forward.  It could be we could lose a lot of support on and off the field."

The former Wales forward said he had also been against the WRU's previous plan of two professional sides that was shelved following a public consultation.

"I was horrified with that thought," he added.

"We are tribal in Wales. We like our local derbies and we like rugby in our areas. Those are important things to me."

Buchanan also raised the prospect of the professional sides losing some control of the playing side of the organisation to the WRU.

"We have people that have been supportive of Welsh rugby, benefactors that have given their money," said Buchanan.

"I can't go into the detail of what is being offered to them, but it isn't something they're keen on signing.

"So we're at loggerheads. It's crucial we mend those fences and understand it's a partnership. That's what is missing at the moment, an agreement with a partnership.

"People have put their hands in their own pockets to put into the professional game and we need to respect that."

Why are Wales' captains leaving for England?

Buchanan also cited Wales captains Jac Morgan and Dewi Lake leaving the Ospreys for Gloucester as another blow for the game in Wales.

"Losing the captains this week is heartbreaking and I find it extraordinary," said Buchanan.

"I'm not blaming Jac or Dewi for leaving. They were obviously in uncertain times in the Ospreys.

"How can you expect people,  especially with families and everything involved in this environment, to hang around? 

"They've got to look and see where the best opportunities are for them."

Buchanan says he finds it extraordinary Welsh rugby finds itself in this position.

"I spent many years at Scarlets as a team manager," he said.

"Then I went into development and we developed the likes of Liam Williams, Aaron Shingler, Gareth Davies and Jonathan Davies and so on.

"They all came through a system that we put in place, all the idea was to produce players for Wales.

"I don't think these two will be the last two to leave Wales and I find that is because we've taken so long to make the decision. Whether it's the right decision, time will tell."

Buchanan is one of the most respected figures within the Welsh game and has represented the WRU with World Rugby.

The 70-year-old had returned to the WRU board in March 2022 having previously served between 2014 and 2019, when he was replaced by former Wales captain Liza Burgess.

He resigned from the board in 2023 after it was revamped but remained on the council.

Ystradgynlais-born Buchanan spent 10 seasons as a player with Llanelli RFC and later served as the club's director of rugby as well as Scarlets team manager.

He won five senior caps for Wales and was part of the squad at the inaugural Rugby World Cup in 1987.

Buchanan says he is not calling for an extraordinary general meeting (EGM), which under the WRU's articles would require the agreement of 10% of member clubs.

There was an annual general meeting (AGM) at the end of November a day after Wales were hammered by South Africa.

The clubs had the opportunity to quiz the WRU board but there was only one question from the floor about the professional game in Wales.

WRU chair Richard Collier-Keywood said he considered the apathy from the clubs as representing a mandate for change.

The WRU have confirmed they have accepted Buchanan's resignation as a council member.

The governing body say they will now run a new election process to replace him as nationally elected council member and will write to clubs to appeal for nominations shortly.

A WRU statement added: "We thank Anthony for his many years of service to Welsh rugby, formerly as a member of our board, more recently as an active member of our council, but also for his dedication to the Scarlets."

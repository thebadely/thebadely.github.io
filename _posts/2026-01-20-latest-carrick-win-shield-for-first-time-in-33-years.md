Highlights: Carrick Rangers v Cliftonville

Carrick Rangers won the County Antrim Shield for the first time in 33 years with a 4-2 shootout win over Cliftonville after a 1-1 draw at Seaview. 

Ryan Curran's strike in the third minute put Cliftonville in front but Adam Lecky equalised with 10 minutes remaining to send the game to a shootout. 

Aidan Steele scored the winning penalty after Curran and Liam McStravick missed in their spot kicks. 

It is the second time Carrick have won the County Antrim Shield in their history.

Cliftonville got off to a dream start in the fourth minute when Jonny Addis' long ball was cushioned into the path of Curran by Joe Gormley, and the forward made no mistake by firing into the bottom left-hand corner from the edge of the area.

Just before the half-hour mark, Carrick had their best chance of the first half when Billy-Joe Burns' right-wing cross was met at the back post by Benjamin Buchanan-Rolleston, but the defender failed to hit the target as the ball drifted the wrong side of the far post.

Moments later, Gormley almost doubled the Reds' advantage after collecting possession from Reece Jordan when he cut in from the left and let fly towards Scott Pengelly's goal, but was denied by a brave block from Jimmy Callacher.

From Rory Hale's resulting corner, the ball eventually fell to the feet of Addis at the back post but Pengelly got down sharply to deny the defender's first-time effort.

As half-time approached, Jim Magilton's men were unfortunate not to have added a second when Hale picked out Shaun Leppard in the six-yard area but the towering defender failed to hit the target.

Cliftonville's frustration in front of goal continued into the second half when Hale rolled a short free-kick to Gormley, who drilled a powerful low strike through the wall but Pengelly was equal to it.

As time ran down, PJ Morrison denied Lecky's goalbound volley before the forward drew the east Antrim outfit level from close range, and Curran then went close to snatching a winner late on as Liam McStravick fired over after stretching to meet his low cross.

Curran missed the opening kick for Cliftonville while Callacher, Luke McCullough and Danny Gibson put Carrick on the brink of the trophy.

McStravick saw his penalty saved by Pengelly and Steele dispatched the decisive kick to spark wild celebrations from the Carrick players and support.

Let's dive into the details: US gymnast Jordan Chiles was originally handed a bronze medal in an event won by Brazil's Rebeca Andrade

US gymnast Jordan Chiles may win back a bronze medal that was stripped from her in the 2024 Paris Olympics.

Chiles, 24, lost her third place finish after an appeal, with Romania's Ana Barbosu  upgraded from fourth to take bronze.

The Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) found in favour of Barbosu in 2024, but Switzerland's supreme court has sent the case back.

Chiles lost her medal after it was decided that an inquiry submitted by the US team about her score fell outside the one-minute time limit.

But Cas will now examine a recording that could show the challenge was lodged in time.

"In the highly exceptional circumstances of the case in question," the Swiss Federal Tribunal said in a statement, "it considers that there is a likelihood for the audio-visual recording of the final to lead to a modification of the contested award in favour of the applicant (Chiles)."

Cas said in a statement it "can now ensure a thorough judicial review of the new evidence that has since been made available".

Chiles said she received online racist abuse after the incident and finished third on US TV show Dancing with the Stars last year.

'He's splattered the stumps!' - Josh Tongue takes three wickets in four balls

Fast bowler Josh Tongue said there is no situation in which England would see a draw as a good outcome from their thrilling first Test against India at Headingley.

England will begin the fifth day on 21-0, 350 runs adrift of a target of 371. If the hosts pull it off, it would be their second-highest successful pursuit in a Test and the second-best on this ground.

Under captain Ben Stokes, England have made clear their aversion to drawing Tests. Only one of England's previous 36 matches since Stokes became skipper three years ago has ended in a draw - and that was because almost two days of the third Ashes Test at Old Trafford in 2023 were lost to rain.

There is a mixed forecast in Leeds on Tuesday, potentially complicating England's run chase.

But, asked if there was any scenario where a draw would become a good result, Tongue said: "No. Just go for the win. That's the clear message in the changing room."

England developed a habit for run chases in the early days of Stokes' captaincy - they successfully pursued 378 to beat India at Edgbaston in 2022.

Headingley, with a reputation for extraordinary finishes, also has a history of teams winning batting last, a history that persuaded Stokes to win the toss and field in this match despite supreme conditions on day one.

Six totals in excess of 250 have successfully been chased at Headingley, more than any other venue in the world apart from the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Australia.

Four of those Leeds chases have come in the past eight years, including the Stokes-inspired overhauling of 359 to beat Australia in an Ashes classic in 2019.

Asked whether a draw had been discussed, Tongue said: "Hopefully we're not in that situation anyway. We'll try and be as positive as we can in that first session, then see where we are at lunch - then we'll take things from there.

"With our batting line-up I feel we can chase down anything. Their bowlers are going to bowl well in periods, but it's about soaking up that pressure and putting it back on the bowlers. I don't see why we can't chase it.

"Obviously we're really confident. If you look at our batting line-up it's very strong. We play a positive brand of cricket."

India batter KL Rahul was also asked if there was a scenario where his team would see a draw as a good result and replied: "I agree with Josh Tongue.

"There's definitely going to be a result. That's what England have said very openly and their style of cricket suggests that as well. It gives us a good opportunity to pick up 10 wickets."

Rahul and Rishabh Pant made superb centuries on day four as the Test looked to be finally taking a decisive turn in India's direction.

But Tongue, in just his fourth Test, took three wickets in four deliveries to help dismiss India for 364 in their second innings and set up England's chase.

Tongue, 27, is nicknamed 'The Mop' by his England and Nottinghamshire team-mate Ben Duckett for his habit of running through the lower order.

On Monday, Tongue removed India's numbers eight, nine and 10 in the same over to end with 3-72, after also taking four in the first innings to wrap up the late order.

"I've done it twice now, so I might have to start calling myself that," Tongue said of his nickname.

"Obviously that's part of the game. I'm happy to contribute to the team by getting those wickets."

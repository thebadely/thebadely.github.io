It has been recently reported that Aston Martin's Lance Stroll came 14th at the Mexico Grand Prix on Sunday, while team-mate Fernando Alonso did not finish the race

Aston Martin committed a procedural breach of Formula 1's cost-cap regulations through a late submission of their documentation for the 2024 season.

The offence happened because the person at the independent company used by Aston Martin who was required to sign the submission was unwell at the time of the deadline on 31 March 2025.

The accounts were finished at the time, and the team did not exceed the cost cap.

Aston Martin have received no punishment from the FIA, but have been required to meet the costs incurred by F1's governing body in preparing the team's "accepted breach agreement".

An FIA statement read: "Although Aston Martin Racing has been found to be in procedural breach, it has not exceeded the cost-cap level, and the procedural breach was of a very minor nature, originated by unpredictable circumstances outside the control of the F1 team."

It added: "Aston Martin did not gain or seek to gain any advantage from the commission of the procedural breach at issue."

Aston Martin submitted its draft documentation before the deadline, just not the finalised signed papers.

All nine other teams were found to be in compliance with the cost cap, as were all five engine manufacturers.

The 2024 cost-cap regulations defined a maximum spend per team of $135m (Â£106.375m).

A number of costs are excluded from the cap, including the salaries of drivers and the three top executives, and marketing spending.

Aston Martin have also announced that American Jak Crawford will be their third driver in 2026. The role will see him act as reserve driver for racers Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll at all grands prix next season.

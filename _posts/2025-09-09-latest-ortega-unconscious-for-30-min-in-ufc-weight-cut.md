According to new developments, Brian Ortega is on a two-fight losing streak, losing four of his past five UFC bouts

Brian Ortega says he was unconscious for about 30 minutes before waking up in the hospital during his weight cut for his UFC Shanghai fight last month.

Ortega, 35, was scheduled to fight Aljamain Sterling in the co-main event but it emerged on Friday that Ortega was struggling to make the featherweight limit of 145lb (10st 5lb).

The American lost a decision to Sterling and was only able to make the 10lb heavier limit of lightweight, cutting a gaunt figure on the scales.

"We cut from midnight all the way until eight in the morning, cutting weight the entire time. I realised I had 1.7lb to go," Ortega said on Instagram, external on Tuesday, two weeks after the contest.

"We were confused on how my body wasn't really pouring out the water, why it was just holding it in, but no matter what we have to get this weight off so we did.

"We went downstairs at about eight, decided to cut more weight. Put the plastics on. 

"I did 20 minutes on the bike. Once I went off, I went unconscious. I was unconscious for about 30 minutes. 

"During that time, they were putting ice on me. They took all my clothes off and left me in boxers. Woke up in the ER [Emergency Room]."

When Ortega woke up in hospital, he and his team decided to continue with the fight and he returned to the hotel to weigh in.

Ortega even had a conversation with Sterling, who he shares a manager with, turning down the chance to be replaced by another fighter.

"I didn't feel good," Ortega cotninued. 

"I wanted to call it off. I got up and just walking outside I almost passed out and fainted. 

"Everything in my body is telling me not to fight.

"First and foremost, I decided to fight for my family. 

"That's my job - to show up and do what I do for them. I fought for my family. Secondly, I fought for you guys [the fans]. 

"You guys have always shown me love, you guys have always supported me, no matter what. 

"It would be unfair to not show up for you guys, regardless of excuses. You just show up and do what you've got to do."

Ortega is a seasoned featherweight and is a two-time UFC title contender.

The UFC has several weight-cutting guidelines, including how much a fighter can safely cut in fight week and have doctors in place to decide if a weight cut needs to be stopped.

There are several techniques banned in weight-cutting for UFC events including the use of intravenous (IV) drips.

BBC Sport has reached out to the UFC for comment.

Welsh gymnast Ruby Evans says she's been getting stopped for photos in the supermarket after winning a silver medal at the World Championships.

The 18-year-old has been welcomed back home to Cardiff after her historic achievement on the floor in Jakarta, Indonesia earlier in October.

She became the first Welsh gymnast to win an individual medal at the World Championships and says she's coming to terms with her newfound fame.

According to new developments, Head coach Derek McInnes is encouraging Hearts fans to dream after a late derby win took his side five points clear at the top

Four days ago, head coach Derek McInnes said it would be "stupid" to suggest Scottish Premiership leaders Hearts are title contenders after just six matches.

Well, what about now after a 91st-minute Edinburgh derby winner sent a euphoric home crowd into a chorus of 'we shall not be moved' at a rocking Tynecastle?

"You have to accept and understand from a professional point of view, all we're trying to do is win games," said McInnes, whose unbeaten side are now five points clear.

"But why should the fans not be excited? And good on them for that. That's the job of being a fan. 

"You can quickly lose hope and heart, but there's plenty of encouragement going about at the minute and it's our job to maintain that."

The early-season optimism in Gorgie has been well documented following the Â£10m investment from Tony Bloom, who bullishly claimed Hearts are in a position to challenge for second this season.

Many sneered at the comments from the Brighton owner, but with each passing week that bold assessment is looking more realistic with Rangers in turmoil and Celtic yet to hit top gear.

Both Old Firm clubs will play their games in hand over Hearts on Sunday, but already Russell Martin's men are 12 points behind the leaders while the reigning champions now have a five-point gap to close.

However, some have used Aberdeen's collapse last term as a reason to put a lid on the positivity bubbling away at Tynecastle.

Jimmy Thelin's side won 10 of their first 11 league games and were at one stage 12 points clear of Rangers, who then ended the campaign 22 ahead of the Dons.

But, like McInnes, former Rangers and Hibernian midfielder Kevin Thomson says Hearts fans have every right to get carried away amid a stunning start to the season.

"The Hearts fans should be excited and get carried away," said Thomson on BBC Sportsound. "They're singing and dancing. That's why we're football fans.

"Can Hearts continue to beat the rest? I don't think anyone can underestimate how difficult it is to win a lot of games on the bounce. It's a tough ask.

"But, if I was a Hearts fan, I would be optimistic and getting carried away like everyone else."

McInnes hails Hearts' mentality after derby win

McInnes described Tynecastle as "berserk" when Craig Halkett appeared at the back post to cushion in an excellent finish in stoppage time.

And even that is putting it mildly.

The centre-back's dramatic winner already marks the third time Hearts have won a Premiership match after the 90th minute this term.

That prompted McInnes to hail his side's mentality, but a rejuvenated Halkett has epitomised Hearts' character during their unbeaten league start after enduring injury trouble in the past couple of seasons. 

Returning towards the end of 2024, having only made 11 appearances in the 2023-24 campaign, Halkett then suffered a hamstring issue at the end of January.

The defender has featured in all but 45 minutes of action in Hearts' first seven league games this term, playing an integral role in three straight clean sheets in the past three wins and scoring in the past two.

McInnes praised the centre-half for a "proper performance" in the derby victory, while former Hearts forward Ryan Stevenson added: "What a finish from Craig [Halkett]. 

"He came through a really hard season last year and looks like a completely new player. That was the sort of finish you would expect from Lawrence Shankland.

"To have that composure in the last minute of a derby is incredible. That's why we love football."

Experts revealed that Zoe Backstedt rides for team Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto

Britain's Zoe Backstedt became the youngest winner of the Baloise Ladies Tour by retaining her lead in the general classification on the final stage.

Sunday's fifth and final stage in Zwevegem, Belgium, came to a dramatic conclusion with a big crash on the final straight, after stage leader Scarlett Souren had been caught with 2km remaining.

An early breakaway meant Mackenzie Coupland held the virtual lead for most of the day, before 20-year-old Backstedt and the rest of the Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto team closed the gap.

Two stage wins on Saturday had put Backstedt in prime position to win, and the Welsh rider maintained her 12 second-lead over Ellen van Dijk on Sunday, with Belgium's Marthe Goossens a further 14 seconds back in third. 

Martina Fidanza sprinted to the stage victory ahead of Barbara Guarischi and Chiara Consonni.

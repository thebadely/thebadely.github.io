Hereâ€™s what you need to know: O'Brien does not believe Linfield will radically change their approach from the firs European qualifier between the teams in July 

Uefa Conference League play-off first leg - Shelbourne v Linfield

Venue: Tolka Park, Dublin Date: Thursday, 21 August Kick-off: 19:45 BST

Shelbourne manager Joey O'Brien says he expects a "sharper" Linfield when the teams meet again at Tolka Park in the Uefa Conference League play-offs. 

The League of Ireland champions edged out the Irish Premiership holders 2-1 over two legs in a Champions League qualifier in July.

Both sides have signed players since with former Cliftonville man Sean Moore joining Shels from West Ham United, while Ryan Yates and Sam Taylor are recent arrivals at Windsor Park.

However, despite the new acquisitions and Linfield manager David Healy playing the red-hot Kieran Offord beside Matthew Fitzpatrick in their win over Vikingur last week, O'Brien feels the main difference from the the Blues may be in terms of match sharpness.

"They're a good team and I've been up watching them since we last played them," said the Shelbourne manager.

"Player-wise, most of them played against us so they probably won't change the way they played.

"They went with two out and out centre forwards (against Vikingur) but they might change it again.

"It was still their pre-season (during the first meeting) so now they will be fitter and match sharper, so it will be a tough game."

Shelbourne players celebrate their 2-1 aggregate victory over Linfield in July when they met in Champions League qualifying 

The Dublin club will be without goalkeeper Conor Kearns, who picked up an injury in their FAI Cup defeat against St Patrick's Athletic.

Kearns initially picked up a hamstring issue in the second leg of the Champions League qualifier against Linfield.

That the teams are to meet in another European qualifier in the same season is strange. After losing to Shels, Linfeld beat Lithuania's Zalgiris and Vikingur of the Faroe Islands in Conference League qualifying to put them on the brink of the group phase.

Shelbourne lost to Qarabag (Champions League) and Rijeka (Europa League) in subsequent qualifiers to drop down into a Conference League playoff.

Both teams finding themselves on the brink of qualification to the group stage is a scenario O'Brien feels all would have jumped at if offered from the start.

"In Europe, it's not something you'll think will happen but it's here now and a great opportunity for both teams," he said.

"If you'd have offered both teams this opportunity at the start that we'd play for a place in group football, we'd have taken your hand off.

"Our performances in Europe have been very good and now it's about implementing that."

The former Republic of Ireland international did not buy into the suggestion his players took their celebrations at Windsor Park from the first meeting too far and it will serve as added motivation for Linfield.

"That euphoria is what you play the game for, so I'm not going to tell the lads to calm down.

"You put so much work and effort into it, when you win you celebrate. It's like Rijeka here the other night [after beating Shelbourne in the Europa League qualifiers], for me to complain about the noise coming out of their dressing room. 

"That's what football's about - celebrating when you win. In two weeks' time when whoever gets through, they'll be celebrating."

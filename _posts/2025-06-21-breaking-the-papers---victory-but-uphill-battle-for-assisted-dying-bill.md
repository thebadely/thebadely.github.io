It has been recently reported that The morning's front pages mainly focus on the decision by MPs to back assisted dying in England and Wales. 

With the headline, "Victory!", the Daily Express features an image of campaigners outside parliament, celebrating what the Guardian calls a "societal shift that will transform end-of-life care". According to the Daily Mirror, there were "tears of joy" as supporters of assisted dying hugged each other in relief.

But the Times warns that the bill faces an "uphill battle" to become law, in the face of opposition from the House of Lords. One peer tells the paper there are "plenty of black arts" that can be used to kill the legislation. The Daily Mail also suggests the battle is "far from over".

The i Weekend says the NHS must now choose how the process will work - as under the current proposals, the toxins used to end life must be self-administered. It says the most likely option will be a cocktail of drugs that can be taken orally as a liquid -- or a lethal injection.

The Sun highlights the vandalism committed by pro-Palestinian activists at RAF Brize Norton, after they broke into the base and sprayed military planes with red paint. Calling those involved "Brize idiots", the paper says it's "beyond belief that security could be so lax" at a time of high alert over Iran and Russia. The Daily Telegraph describes the incident as an "act of sabotage" - and says the government is right to respond by proscribing Palestine Action as a terrorist group.

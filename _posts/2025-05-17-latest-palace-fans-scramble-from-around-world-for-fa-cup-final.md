According to new developments, Crystal Palace have lost their previous two FA Cup finals, in 1990 and 2016

The jubilant scenes that greeted the final whistle of Crystal Palace's FA Cup semi-final win over Aston Villa soon gave way to a scramble for tickets to the match that can't be missed. 

For most Palace fans, the commute to Wembley Stadium will be relatively straightforward. But for others, it will be a labour of love as the Eagles take on Manchester City bidding to win their first major trophy.

Ross Phillips, 39, grew up in Australia with English parents. But the connection he felt to his mum's Croydon roots solidified on holiday to England in 1994, when he first visited Selhurst Park.

"It was an amazing feeling, hearing football fans singing live for the first time," he told BBC Sport. 

"As soon as mum showed me her old school in South Norwood I had this community feeling and a special place in my heart. This club was for me and I've been addicted ever since."

Ross has now lived in 10 different countries, including Ukraine for the last two years as an English teacher. With no flights in and out of Kyiv since the start of the war, he's had to take a 10-hour train to Lviv near the Polish border, a separate four-hour train to Krakow and finally a three-hour flight to London. 

"It's a nightmare, it's so tiring just to get out of Kiev with all the military stops and trains" he says. 

Despite the tribulations though, it was unthinkable that he would ever skip this game.

"We don't make the final often and I'll live my life in regret if I miss them lifting their first piece of silverware. If they beat City I would die a happy man."

You can watch the BBC's live FA Cup final coverage from 15:25 BST on Saturday on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and online, and listen live on BBC Radio 5 Live.

How Crystal Palace reached the FA Cup final

Season ticket holder Jack Dunn, 30, managed to bag himself one ticket for the final - but when his 16-year-old brother Johnny said he also wanted to come, he knew what he had to do.

Johnny was born in England but emigrated with their dad, Gavin, to Adelaide, Australia in 2014 and hasn't been back since. 

In 2019, Gavin died suddenly in his sleep from a brain aneurysm. Johnny was only 10. This trip is the first time he's ever flown alone.

"He' s only ever been to one game when he was four and this is the first game since Dad died, so let's hope he's the lucky charm" says Jack. 

He will take Johnny to Wembley to meet friends but, if he can't source a ticket he'll watch the match in a pub nearby: "I was sat in a queue for an hour to get that ticket - but giving it up is what you do for family. Hopefully Palace can win it for our dad."

Johnny isn't the only one flying in from down under. Nigel Moore is an IT consultant living in New Zealand. 

He was born in Sutton, south London, and has travelled to England with his 13-year-old son Alfie, who is missing a week-and-a-half of school. 

Their journey to London has taken 30 hours, with flights costing more than Â£2,000. Nigel has also spent Â£2,000 for three tickets from a resale website, after they missed out in the ballot, but says the expense will all be worth it.

"The thought of Palace winning and me not being there scares me more than than the positive thoughts seeing them win would give me," Nigel said. 

"From a family perspective it's massive. It's great having Alfie to come and see my cousins and brother, especially when you live so far away. 

"I feel fortunate I'm in a position when I can try and ignore the cost of it to give Alfie something he'll always remember."

Nigel Moore and son Alfie have travelled from New Zealand for the final

Not all fans are born-and-bred south Londoners. Zane Gresback, 41, and his wife Angelike are travelling from South Carolina for only their second Palace match in person, leaving their 21-month-old daughter for the first time. 

"In 2015 I was working in Xiamen, China, and went to a pub one evening called the Londoner," says Zane. "Palace were on TV playing Stoke. One year later, on holiday to Dominican Republic, I think I counted 20 different Palace fans from either their wardrobe or tattoos. The club just kind of kept choosing me."

Most American fans choose a big-six club, but not Zane: "I wanted to pick an underdog club just because that's been my background - grittiness and hard work to make it is a big sense of pride. So as I learned more about Palace, the club meant something deeply to me on that level.

"We just worship Palace and have been so embraced by the fanbase. The final is more like a celebration of togetherness. We want to see a trophy raised, but regardless, it's about seeing these friends from a million miles away, brought together by football."

The family and friends of Dena Collins, a Crystal Palace fan who died two years ago, will wear Dena's name on their shirts at the final

Regardless of the result, it will be an emotional day for the family and friends of Dena Collins. 

Dena was a season ticket holder at Selhurst Park but the primary school teacher from Eltham, south London, died two years ago from an undiagnosed blood clot, the day after being discharged from hospital. 

Stephanie Brewer, who went to games home and away with her, said: "Dena's death broke our hearts. It's a cliche but she lit up a room, she bled red and blue. I've never met any fan who loves the club the way she did."

Stephanie, along with at least 10 other friends and family members, will wear Dena's name proudly on their shirts at the final, just as they did for the semi-final, along with the number 28 - the age she was when she died. They will also have masks, tattoos and cushions with her face on them. 

"I think it brings us a bit of peace to know she's with us at the game," adds Stephanie. 

"Wembley is so special, she'd have loved the final. I think it would be amazing if we win and a comfort to think that Dena's still here with us, when it happens."

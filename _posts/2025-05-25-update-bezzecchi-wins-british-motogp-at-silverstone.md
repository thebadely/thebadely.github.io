It has been recently reported that Marco Bezzecchi claimed his first MotoGP victory since the 2023 season

Italian Marco Bezzecchi claimed victory at a tumultuous British Grand Prix to hand Aprilia their first win of the season.

Sunday's chaotic showpiece at Silverstone was red flagged for an oil spill, while several riders also crashed or retired from leading positions.

Bezzecchi's victory was Aprilia's first since the Grand Prix of the Americas last year. LCR Honda's Johann Zarco finished second and Ducati's Marc Marquez edged out Franco Morbidelli in third to extend his lead in the world championship.

Both Marquez and his brother Alex crashed while in the lead before the race had to be restarted because of an oil spill, and polesitter Fabio Quartararo regained the lead before having to retire with a bike issue.

Bezzecchi, whose victory was his first since the 2023 Indian Grand Prix, is the 11th different Silverstone champion in the past 11 races. 

"It's amazing. It has been a really tough time for me in this past month," he said. "Aprilia trusted in me and we worked really hard.

"The team made a wonderful job... I was waiting for a day like this since my last win."

Alex Marquez, who ended brother Marc's sprint dominance with victory on Saturday, maintained his form at the start of the Grand Prix to launch past Quartararo, but lost control at the first turn. 

Marc also crashed out of the lead before the red flag came out in the final sector for the oil spill after Morbidelli and Aleix Espargaro collided.

When the race restarted, Quartararo took the lead from Francesco Bagnaia, who also crashed out later on.

Disaster struck for Yamaha's Quartararo, though, as the Frenchman signalled he had a problem with his bike before Bezzecchi took advantage to claim victory.

It has been recently reported that Everton playmaker Iliman Ndiaye is one of the Premier League players at the Africa Cup of Nations

The crunch Christmas period is upon us. Gameweeks 18-21 will bring four deadlines in 11 days between 26 December and 6 January.

Expect heavy rotation, injuries, suspensions and continued absences due to the Africa Cup of Nations. 

There is nothing to panic about though. This is the time that FPL managers who plan well, stay engaged with their teams and don't miss deadlines often gain in ranks and mini-leagues.

Here is FPL expert Pras Singhal's five-step plan to stay ahead of the curve over the festive period.

Despite the mayhem there are things that can be planned for. 

Several players go into the Christmas period with the risk of suspension for reaching five yellow cards. 

Players like Antoine Semenyo will serve a one-game ban should they pick up another yellow card between now and gameweek 19. Several players have also left for Afcon. 

Staying ahead of such absences helps make quick decisions when deadlines come thick and fast.

The Christmas period is notorious for heavy rotation, so pay attention to the bench order in your squad. 

If needed, use a transfer to ensure you have a good first and even second sub most weeks. 

With so many good cheap defenders (4.6m and below) and cheap midfielders (less than 5.5m) in the game, there is really no reason to have a non-playing bench.

This isn't a period to make short-term gambles. 

Pick long-term sensible picks that can be reliable and played even in tougher fixtures.

At this time of year, players who regularly play 90 minutes for their teams are even more valuable. 

Not only do more minutes usually turn into more FPL points, but the rotation risk players are also often prime candidates to miss the odd game during this time. 

When choosing between two picks, make sure minutes are given a heavy consideration.

Even small niggles can mean players miss two or three games. That's what a short turnaround does. 

Follow reliable sources and press conferences for the latest injury news and potential line-ups. 

Wait until the last possible moment before the deadline to make transfers to benefit from the latest information.

According to new developments, The Dragons were easy winners over Wigan Warriors in last year's final

Two-time defending Wheelchair Challenge Cup winners Catalans Dragons have been removed from the 2025 competition by tournament organisers after a dispute over international matches.

The French side were set to face Halifax Panthers in the quarter-finals next month.

But the Rugby Football League (RFL) said Catalans' invitation to compete had been withdrawn "in response to a refusal by the French Federation to play any international fixtures against England until next autumn's World Cup".

England and France are the leading international sides in the world rankings, with England the World Cup holders having beaten their French rivals in Manchester in 2022.

They have faced each other in double-headers at the end of the last two seasons, but England will be travelling to Australia later this year for a four-Test series.

The Dragons, who have England international Seb Bechara in their ranks, won the French Cup final earlier this month.

They have dominated the Challenge Cup since their first appearance in 2022, reaching the final three times and winning in 2023 and 2024.

Their removal from the draw means Halifax, who have Bechara's international team-mate Jack Brown back in their ranks after a spell in Australia, receive a bye into the last four.

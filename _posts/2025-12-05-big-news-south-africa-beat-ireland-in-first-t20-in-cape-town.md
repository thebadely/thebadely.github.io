Scorecard

South Africa Women cruised to victory by 105 runs in their first Twenty20 international against Ireland Women in Cape Town.

The hosts won the toss and chose to bat first, but Jane Maguire removed Faye Tunnicliife after just one run.

South Africa recovered well courtesy of captain Laura Wolvaardt, who led the way as she registered 115 not out including 15 fours and four sixes.

Wolvaardt recorded the seventh fastest century in Women's T20 International history, needing just 52 deliveries to get to the milestone.

Sune Luus added 81 more runs as the World Cup runners-up set a big target of 221 for Ireland, which they fell well short of.

Lloyd Tennant's side had a difficult opening to their chase as they lost two wickets inside the first over with Amy Hunter and Orla Prendergast dismissed.

Captain Gaby Lewis (30) and Leah Paul (34) steadied the ship, but Ireland were all out for 115 after 18 overs with Luus claiming four wickets.

The teams will face off again in the second T20 on Sunday in Paarl at 12:00 GMT.

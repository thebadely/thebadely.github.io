Experts revealed that Jaka Bijol made 95 appearances for Italian club Udinese

Leeds United have signed Slovenia centre-back Jaka Bijol on a five-year deal from Udinese.

The 26-year-old joins for an undisclosed fee and becomes Leeds' second summer recruit after forward Lukas Nmecha joined on a free transfer from Wolfsburg.

Bijol scored two goals in 37 appearances in all competitions for the Serie A side last season. 

"This is a big day for me, for my family and I'm happy to be here," said Bijol. "Maybe the biggest one of my career so far, but I'm ready for it.

"I work for it and that's why I'm here, because it's a big challenge for everyone. It's a big challenge for me, for the club, and we're getting ready for it together. 

"I think the club and myself are ready for the Premier League.

"I can promise that I will give everything, that I will give everything in every training as well to be ready for the first game of the season and then just go from there."

Originally a defensive midfielder, Bijol began his career in his native Slovenia with Rudar Velenje before moving to CSKA Moscow.

He played on loan with German club Hannover 96 before permanently joining Udinese in 2022. 

Bijol has Champions League experience and has also won 63 caps since making his Slovenia debut aged 19 in 2018.

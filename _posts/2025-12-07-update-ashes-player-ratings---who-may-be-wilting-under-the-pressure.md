England soundly beaten by Australia in second Test drubbing

Australia have beaten England by eight wickets in the second Test to go 2-0 up in the Ashes.

Here are our player ratings: 

Ben Duckett - 2 

Got a first-baller, which can happen to anyone, and unlucky to get the grubber from Scott Boland in the second innings. His first-innings drop of Alex Carey was a crucial moment in the game.

Zak Crawley - 5

Showed courage in the first innings to put a first-Test pair behind him and looked good in the second until a thoughtless shot. Now playing for his future in the team.

Ollie Pope - 2

Horrific shot in the first innings and not much better in the second. Feels most vulnerable to be replaced if England make changes to the top order.

Joe Root - 8

Finally got the elusive century in Australia and the scenes on the first evening were of genuine affection to an England legend. Still, Root will know the result has diminished the meaning of his achievement.

Harry Brook - 2

Unforgivable chasing of Mitchell Starc in the twilight ended a skittish first innings, made all the more wasteful when he was out to a good ball in the second. Not currently acting like a captain-in-waiting.

Ben Stokes - 6

Tactically had a poor game, but tried to set an example to his team-mates with the bat. Unfortunate to be run out in the first innings and furious he could not conjure another escape in the second.

Jamie Smith - 1

Faced 13 balls for four runs, dropped a catch and did not move for another. A real worry the gloveman is wilting under the pressure of an Ashes tour.

Will Jacks - 6 

Did what was expected in his first Test for three years. Battled with the bat, was tidy with the ball once Stokes remembered him and took a stunning catch. Up the order in Adelaide?

Gus Atkinson - 3 

Has not bowled badly, yet has only managed three wickets in the series. Is gifting away his wicket down the order when England need his runs - he has a century at Lord's.

Brydon Carse - 4

Effort levels never drop, but four wickets flatter his bowling, which rarely included a delivery in the batter's half. Another who could contribute more with the bat, given his ability.

Jofra Archer - 4

Gets a mark for his first-innings batting, then loses it for turning up on day three with a pillow tucked under his arm. Developing an unhappy knack of bowling well without taking wickets.

'He's done it!' - Root hits maiden century in Australia

Jake Weatherald - 7

Gave Australia momentum in the first innings with his maiden Test half-century. Could be an Ashes winner after only three Test caps.

Travis Head - 4

Quiet game after his heroics of the first Test. Took the fight to England after he was dropped by Smith, and looks a dangerous combination with Weatherald.

Marnus Labuschagne - 7

After being left out of the team has been Australia's most consistent batter in the first two Tests. Will get a big score at some point.

Steve Smith - 7 

A century looked inevitable until he was dismissed by a wonder catch. Pulled off a stunner of his own to end England's fightback.

Cameron Green - 5

Was batting well in the first innings until a dismissal ugly enough to get him into the England team. Still being nursed around fitness to bowl.

Alex Carey - 8

Was fortunate to be dropped twice in a crucial half-century, but this Test will be remembered for his glovework. It is a struggle to remember a better display of keeping in a single Test.

Josh Inglis - 5

May wonder about his place if Usman Khawaja returns to fitness. Stunning one-stump run-out of Stokes altered the momentum of the first day.

Michael Neser - 8

Three pink-ball Tests, three wins. Crucial runs and five wickets in England's second innings. A simple trap - bowl line and length with the keeper up, let England make mistakes. They did.

Mitchell Starc - 10

Even better than the first Test, with vital runs added to another destruction of England with the ball. Having a Mitchell Johnson-style series to savour.

Scott Boland - 6

Possibly has not been at his best with the ball, but still gets it right often enough for England to be suckered in. Batted better than most of England's top order.

Brendan Doggett - 6 

Has done a perfectly adequate job standing in for Pat Cummins but will probably make way for the skipper in Adelaide.

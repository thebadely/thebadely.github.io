Let's dive into the details: Chelsea's Enzo Fernandez complained about the heat during the Club World Cup

Every match at the 2026 World Cup will have three-minute hydration breaks in each half.

Fifa said the measure is being introduced to "prioritise player welfare" and will happen in matches regardless of the weather conditions "to ensure equal conditions for all teams, in all matches".

The referee will stop the game 22 minutes into each half to allow players to rehydrate.

With the tournament taking place across the US, Canada and Mexico in June and July 2026, experts warn that high temperatures, wildfires and even hurricanes could affect teams, fans and stadium workers.

The recent Pitches in Peril report - compiled by pressure groups Football for the Future and Common Goal - found that 10 of the 16 venues for the World Cup are at "very high risk of experiencing extreme heat stress conditions."

The scheduling of last June and July's Club World Cup drew complaints from players and managers as matches took place in extreme heat.

Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fernandez said he felt "dizzy" while playing in "very dangerous" heat at the tournament.

Last week, England manager Thomas Tuchel said he may have his substitutes stay in the dressing room during matches because of the risks posed by high temperatures.

Fifa said the hydrations breaks will be a "streamlined and simplified version" of similar ones used at previous tournaments including the Club World Cup.

Cooling breaks were previously mandatory in each half when the temperature exceed 32C.

Heat is one the factors that has led to the World Cup having 13 different kick-off times.

"For every game, no matter where the games are played, no matter if there's a roof, [or] temperature-wise, there will be a three-minute hydration break. It will be three minutes from whistle to whistle in both halves," said chief tournament officer Manolo Zubiria.

"Obviously, if there's an injury [stoppage] at the moment of the 20th or 21st minute and it's ongoing, this will be addressed on the spot with the referee."

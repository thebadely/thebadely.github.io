Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Eilish McColgan surpassed Steph Twell's 2019 marathon time

Eilish McColgan has set a new Scottish marathon record after also surpassing her mother's best time at the London Marathon.

McColgan, 34, finished eighth, crossing the line in 02:24:25, which beat Steph Twell's mark of 2:26:40 set in Frankfurt in 2019.

Liz McColgan ran London in 2:26:52 in 1997.

The younger McColgan had said last week she was primarily aiming to complete her marathon debut with "no mishaps" but admitted to having a couple of "loose goals".

She has won silver and bronze medals at European level over 3,000m, 5,000m and 10,000m and won 10,000m gold and 5,000m silver at the 2022 Birmingham Commonwealth Games.

Great Britain's Rose Harvey finished just behind McColgan in ninth as Tigst Assefa set a new women's-only world record of 2:15:50 to win the annual event.

"I've never raced further than a half-marathon, so the thought of doing it back-to-back was a little bit scary," McColgan said.

"The crowds today - it's hard to put into words unless you're out there and experience it, it is just insane."

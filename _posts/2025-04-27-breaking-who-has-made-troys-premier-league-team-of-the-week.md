It has been recently reported that After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the Week.

Here are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.

Robert Sanchez (Chelsea): He's been pretty poor all season and the general consensus is that Chelsea are going to have to change their goalkeeper, but he was very good against Everton. He made three or four decent saves and then was in a position where he could command his box much better than he has done for most of the season.

Kieran Trippier (Newcastle): He was excellent, assured, calm and quality on the ball. At the ripe old age of 34, he is still showing that it's necessary to have experience in the side. He helped Newcastle to manage the game when they went 2-0 up. He showed quality for two of the goals - standing a cross up for Dan Burn and also his corner for Newcastle's third was magnificent.

Carlos Baleba (Brighton): Brighton will do well to keep hold of Baleba. There are so many levels to go up in his armoury - he is just frightening. He's tall and powerful and his celebration after his last-minute winner wasn't too bad either.

Dan Burn (Newcastle): Burn is the magic man of Newcastle, he just keeps on going. Every time you think his story is doing to drop off, he just keeps getting better. Burn had a real ding-dong with Liam Delap but had the Ipswich forward in his back pocket and then also scored a goal.

Rayan Ait-Nouri (Wolves): It looks to me like he is playing for a move, he looks focused and has the right mindset. His assist for the goal was fantastic but he just continually gets up and down the field. There are only a couple of games left and he still has that burning desire to have an impact.

Alexis Mac Allister (Liverpool): He has been Liverpool's most consistent midfielder this season. It was a great finish from him, he just looked so calm. The best bit wasn't the goal but it was that he was the standard-setter throughout.

Yasin Ayari (Brighton): He was good and solid but it's all about his goal. What a hit and what a show of technical ability to use Lucas Paqueta who was running at him and just bend it round him.

Matheus Cunha (Wolves): I'm running out of ways to praise him. He is just at home at Wolves - we know he is leaving but he just looks so comfortable in that side. Wolves know the offer is coming and he just wants to sign off on a positive. He is known as a bit of a maverick and has a wild side but at the moment he has his head screwed on.

Mohamed Salah (Liverpool): He just continues to score goals and had a very decent celebration - a selfie in front the Kop. It's at a time when you think he isn't playing at his full potential too and on a weekend when Liverpool secure the title.

Antoine Semenyo (Bournemouth): I'm so impressesed every time I watch him. I played against him at Bristol City and didn't think he would be able to go on and do what he's doing in the Premier League, but he is going from strength to strength. Manchester United need to be looking at him - he is powerful and drives, that's what they need.

Alexander Isak (Newcastle): He could have scored four on the day. His movement and link-up play is excellent. This guy is the complete striker in world football.

Arne Slot (Liverpool): Could it be anyone else on the weekend that he delivers Liverpool a 20th league title? He has come in and only bought Federico Chiesa and turned Liverpool into a title winning team. He's excellent as a manager, excellent in every interview and handles any adversity in the right kind of way.

Northern Ireland midfielder Isaac Price says the team has "confidence" and "maybe a little arrogance" when they take on the big teams.

Michael O'Neill's side are facing into two pivotal games at Windsor Park in their big to qualify for next summer's World Cup in the USA, Canada and Mexico as they host Slovakia on Friday before taking on Germany on Monday.

Currently, Northern Ireland have three points from their opening two games on the road, having won in Luxembourg before falling to a 3-1 defeat against Germany in Cologne.

Slovakia lead the way in Group A with two wins from two including a shock home victory against Germany and although there is no underestimating the tasks ahead, there is also belief within the squad they can make home advantage count.

"Every time I pull on the Northern Ireland shirt I feel confident and that I'm going to score goals," the West Bromwich Albion players told BBC Sport NI's Stephen Watson.

"I always feel we are going to get good results as there are a lot of top players in this squad and a real confidence, maybe a little bit of arrogance we can go and beat these top teams.

"Personally and as a team, there's still loads to develop on and I think that's where Michael is getting it right at the moment.

"We're not getting ahead of ourselves. We've had a few good results but we've also had some results that have been really bad over the past year, so it's trying to get to the middle ground of consistency."

Price felt he "didn't play well" in the 3-1 win away to Luxembourg when his early penalty was saved despite Jamie Reid tucking away the rebound.

However, he responded with a goal against Germany to bring his international tally to 10 and credits manager Michael O'Neill for giving him the confidence to bounce back against the four-time world champions.

"It's about not getting too high when things are going well or getting too low when they aren't," he said.

"The Luxembourg game I missed a penalty, didn't play well and was coming off a low point but then you play against Germany.

"The night before, Michael came over and said 'forget about what happened the other night, you'll go and do something tomorrow' and it happened. Michael has been around so long he'll have seen it with other players, so it was a great feeling to get one against Germany."

The 22-year-old is part of the new crop of Northern Ireland players bidding to reach a major finals for the first time since Euro 2016 when O'Neill was in his first stint as manager.

However, he believes the "maturity" in the camp can help them through the upcoming games.

"The ground and the fans will be electric, but it's about staying calm and composed because if you let the occasion get to you, it's never the best thing.

"We've the right level of maturity in the group and players who have been there before, so they can help us.

"I hope they (opposition) realise we have a good young side and every team comes here fears it as they should do."

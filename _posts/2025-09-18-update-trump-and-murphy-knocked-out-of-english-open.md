It has been recently reported that Judd Trump (left) has not won a tournament since the UK Championship in 2024

World number one Judd Trump slipped to a 4-3 defeat against Elliot Slessor, while Shaun Murphy lost by the same score to Jackson Page in the fifth round of the English Open. 

Slessor, ranked 23rd in the world, opened up a 2-0 lead in Thursday's afternoon session at the Brentwood Centre, helped by a break of 67.

Trump, who is yet to reach a semi-final this season, responded with two half-centuries as he reeled off the next three frames. 

However, Slessor compiled a break of 79 to force a decider and booked his quarter-final place against Mark Allen with a run of 64. 

Meanwhile, reigning Masters champion Murphy knocked in breaks of 93 and 102 as he fought back from 3-1 down to 3-3 against Page. 

While both players had opportunities in the seventh frame, Welshman Page held his nerve to seal victory and will now face four-time world champion Mark Selby, who constructed four half-centuries in a 4-2 win over Wu Yize.

Northern Ireland's Allen produced a superb turnaround as he came from 3-0 down to beat China's Ding Junhui 4-3.

Luca Brecel beat Robbie Williams 4-3 to earn a last-eight meeting with China's Zhou Yuelong, who overcame Barry Hawkins 4-2.

The last quarter-final will see Wales' Jak Jones take on Irishman Aaron Hill who beat Jack Lisowski 4-1. Jones edged his fifth round match with Ricky Walden 4-3.

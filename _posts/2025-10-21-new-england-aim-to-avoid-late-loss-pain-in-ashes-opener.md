It has been recently reported that Shaun Wane will face Australia for the first time as England coach on Saturday at Wembley

England must avoid a repeat of some agonising late defeats if they are to win the first rugby league Ashes series for 22 years, says coach Shaun Wane.

Wane's side have been haunted by a golden point extra-time defeat by Samoa in their World Cup semi-final three years ago.

There is also historical pain to overcome when they face Australia at Wembley on Saturday.

The last time the Ashes were staged, in 2003, Australia won all three Tests against a Great Britain side made up largely of English players.

All three were closely fought, with Australia winning each by six points or fewer. Britain also led during the second half of every game.

After Saturday's match at Wembley, England face Australia at Everton's Hill Dickinson Stadium on 1 November and at AMT Headingley on 8 November. All three matches are 14:30 kick-offs and will be live on BBC One.

The record attendance for an England rugby league international, of 67,545 against New Zealand at Wembley in the 2013 World Cup semi-finals, is set to be challenged as both sides aim to start with victory.

Returning to London for the first time since that painful 27-26 golden point loss to Samoa three years ago, Wane says he has hammered the need to play at full tempo for the entire duration.

"I have talked with the players [about late defeats]," Wane told a media conference at Wembley on Tuesday.

"No matter how close we come is irrelevant. I have spoken to the players about scenarios, and the importance of switching on for 80 minutes.

"We will show Australia respect, and make sure we are switched on right to the very end."

Wane, who has overseen series victories over Tonga and Samoa since the World Cup, says he has his 17-man squad selected for Saturday's match, and described his players as looking "slick and intense" in training before arguably their toughest test since he took charge of England in 2020.

"We need 17 players to have their best game, that is the level of quality in the Australian team," he said.

"We have players who can do that. They know how good they must be. It will take an almighty performance, but we are doing everything we can."

England's failure to join Australia in the World Cup final in 2022 ago means this is their first meeting for eight years.

That was in the 2017 World Cup final, which they lost 6-0 to the Kangaroos in Brisbane.

They have not faced Australia on home soil since a 36-18 loss at London Stadium in November 2016, with the planned Ashes series in 2020 cancelled amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Five years later, this long-awaited series has arrived, and the current generation can experience one of the most hotly contested tests in rugby league.

"Last time there was an Ashes I was eight - I know I look older but I'm only 30," said Australian captain Isaah Yeo.

"You look back on how passionate the players were, the way former players speak about the tours and how much it meant to them, 30 or 40 years ago.

"You want the Australia squad of 2025 to look back on it in 30 years' time and think about how wonderful it was to be an Australian player."

Australia are the reigning world champions, the number one ranked international side and heavy favourites for the Ashes.

But their preparations have not been totally smooth, with coach Mal Meninga stepping down in June to take over at National Rugby League side Perth Bears.

Kevin Walters has stepped into the role for this series and denied that it is any sort of experiment regarding who should lead Australia at their home World Cup in 2026.

"It's not so much an audition for the World Cup, as it is prime time," Walters said. "When I got the job, I rang a few of the players because there is noise around Australia about international rugby and where it sits on the calendar. They were very excited by it all.

"We have really skipped a generation of English and Australian players in these sorts of games and series; it could be a once-in-a-lifetime chance for these players and staff. It is a unique experience, and if you are in the world of rugby league, this is where you want to be.

"For me, the last few months have been about making connections with the players and staff. On a three-week tour, we need to come together quickly. We have great players, but if we are not as one, it could be not so good for us. My job is to get the players connected and focused."

According to new developments, Lucas Paqueta has 18 months remaining on his contract at West Ham

West Ham have agreed a deal to sell Brazil forward Lucas Paqueta to Flamengo for more than 41m euros (Â£35.5m).

The 28-year-old, who moved to West Ham from Lyon in 2022, has been given permission to fly to his homeland to make the move before the winter transfer deadline on 2 February.

West Ham had been open to agreeing a deal that would have seen Paqueta remain at the London Stadium on loan for the rest of the season but Flamengo pushed to complete the move this month. 

Paqueta is set to make the switch with the Brazilian top-flight starting in March.

The Hammers have won three matches in succession for the first time since 2023 without Paqueta, who has been unavailable in recent weeks.

However, 18th-placed West Ham remain in the Premier League's relegation zone, five points adrift of safety.

It has been recently reported that Rangers demanded goal-line technology after Nicolas Raskin was denied a goal

The Scottish FA says fining Rangers over a comment by their former defender John Brown on the club's television channel "was entirely in keeping with the application of the rules".

Rangers said on Thursday the SFA "will be watched closely" after they received a Â£3,000 penalty following Brown's description of a decision in a game against Hibernian in May as "corrupt".

Nicolas Raskin appeared to bundle the ball over the line but the goal was not given by the on-field referee and was not referred by the video assistant referee.

The SFA's key match incident panel later ruled it should have been awarded and the Ibrox club feel there has been a "lack of consistency with the Scottish FA's policing of similar incidents".

But the SFA said a recent "sanction imposed on Richard Foster of Motherwell for comments of a similar nature in the media" demonstrates its consistency.

Referee Nick Walsh and his officials thought the ball had been kept out by Hibs defender Rocky Bushiri and VAR Andrew Dallas ruled there was no camera angle that proved Raskin's effort had gone in.

Hibs equalised through Kieron Bowie moments later and the match finished 2-2.

Brown said on the club's in-house TV channel: "I would say it is corrupt."

Commentator Tom Miller replied: "Well, I'm not sure we can actually say that." However, Brown added: "Well, I am saying it."

Rangers subsequently demanded the introduction of goal-line technology and said of the fine on Thursday: "If this is now the standard, they will be watched closely to ensure it is applied across the board, consistently, without exception and without favour."

The SFA said in a statement: "Investigations were undertaken in previous cases outlined and that the compliance officers of the time saw fit to issue a censure by way of warning letter for potential breaches deemed insufficiently serious to be progressed to a notice of complaint.

"We have requested written reasons from the panel chair involved in the tribunal and in the interests of transparency will publish in due course."

The SFA added that the relevant protocol had been introduced "in response to the referee strike of 2010, when match officials campaigned for greater protection after enduring sustained personal criticism from clubs and fans".

"Ahead of a new season, we remind clubs of their responsibilities in this regard."

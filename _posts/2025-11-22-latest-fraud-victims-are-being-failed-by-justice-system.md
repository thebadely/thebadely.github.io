It has been recently reported that Victims of fraud are being failed by the criminal justice system, charities are warning, as new analysis suggests only a fraction of reports result in a prosecution.

There were 1.2 million recorded cases of fraud in England and Wales in the 12 months to June, data from the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau shows. 

But in the same time frame fewer than 13,000 cases were prosecuted, Ministry of Justice figures show.

Wayne Stevens, the national lead for fraud at charity Victim Support, said: "Our experience is that victims get a pretty poor deal from the criminal justice system as a whole." The Home Office said it would publish "an ambitious fraud strategy in the New Year."

The true scale of fraud could be much larger. There were 4.1 million estimated instances of fraud in the 12 months to June this year, according the Office for National Statistics' Crime Survey for England and Wales, which can include crimes that were not reported to the police.

Joan Holdaway, 85, shared her experience as part of the BBC's Scam Safe Week from 22 to 28 November.

She had £1,000 stolen after being bombarded with phonecalls from fraudsters using photos of celebrities to promote their investment scam online.

"It was very upsetting," said Ms Holdaway. "All I kept thinking about was how I was going to eke out the money that I'd still got. Then I kept thinking 'I'm not going to get this back, I know I'm not.'"

She contacted the UK's national reporting centre for fraud and cybercrime, Action Fraud, which put her in touch with Cleveland Police. Officers referred her to the Victim Care and Advice Service which helped her to be reimbursed by her bank under fraud rules introduced just over a year ago. 

Known as the mandatory reimbursement requirement it obliges banks to refund most victims of push payment fraud - when victims are  tricked and manipulated into transferring money to criminals themselves.

No one has been prosecuted in Ms Holdaway's case and she told the BBC the emotional and mental impact had been tremendous.

"It's made me very, very suspicious. You just cannot sleep properly and it's just on your mind all the time. All I was doing was avoiding ever speaking to anyone again.

"I don't think you ever get over it really... I think it stays with you... and you wonder anybody that you don't know, are they who they say they are? It's really dreadful."

Mr Stevens said Victim Support was concerned people were not taken seriously when they report fraud to the bank or police.

"If the fraud has an international dimension the fraud often isn't investigated," he said.

"Until recently victims often didn't get reimbursed the money that was lost to criminals."

He said Victim Support was calling for improved campaigns to raise public awareness about the real risks of fraud. It also called for greater cooperation between banks and social media companies where fraud can take place.

UK Finance, which represents the banking industry, said: "Protecting customers is a top priority and banks invest billions in advanced systems to help detect and stop fraud happening in the first place."

The Home Office said in a statement fraud was "a serious and damaging crime that can affect anyone, at any time, and we are determined to bring those responsible to justice".

A spokesperson added: "In the new year we will publish an ambitious Fraud Strategy, which will reduce fraud, target offenders and protect victims."

One charity in Stockton-on-Tees is on the front line in the fight against fraud offering help, support and advice for thousands of victims every year.

Dave Mead helps run the Victim Care and Advice Service, VCAS.

"A big, big chunk of our work and some of our most challenging work is fraud," he said. "The figures are eye-watering. We're contacting between 500 to 800 victims of fraud every month.

"The vast majority of victims don't report fraud [and] we find some. But we've got to get into the communities through elderly groups, faith groups, youth groups.

"We've got to raise the conversation."

Vicky Beaumont is an advice and support worker for VCAS.

"To be honest, even though I help people and speak to people day in day out, it's still hard to see them [victims] relive that emotion.

"[But] it's so rewarding, it's such a good job to do to be able to support people like that and get great results for them. I would do this all day everyday."

According to new developments, Lisa Tertsch was part of the Germany team which won gold in the triathlon mixed relay event at Paris 2024

Lisa Tertsch claimed the world triathlon title for the first time as Great Britain's Beth Potter had to settle for third place in the overall standings.

Tertsch won gold in the World Triathlon Championship finals in Wollongong, Australia, with a time of one hour 56 minutes 50 seconds.

The 26-year-old German finished 14 seconds clear of Italy's Bianca Seregni, with  France's Emma Lombardi a further 12 seconds back.

Tertsch collected 1,250 points for winning the event, which took her overall tally to 3886.26 as she leapfrogged defending champion Cassandre Beaugrand (3577.04) of France and Potter (3313.18) into top spot.

Olympic bronze medal winner Potter was bidding to win the title for a second time, following victory in 2023, but could only finish 16th in the final event.

The 33-year-old Scot was joint leader with Beaugrand before the event began but Tertsch, who had been fourth, produced a superb performance to seal victory. 

Beaugrand lost ground early in the 10km run, in hot and blustery conditions, while Potter failed to keep pace with the leading pack - which allowed Tertsch to cash in as she excelled on a steep course.

In the men's event, Australian Matt Hauser capped a dominant season as he won gold in a time of 1:42:42 to clinch his first world title success.

Hauser finished with 4,250 points, comfortably clear of Brazil's Miguel Hidalgo and Portugal's Vasco Vilaca.

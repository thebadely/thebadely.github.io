It has been recently reported that WRU chair Richard Collier-Keywood replaced Ieuan Evans in the role in 2023

Clubs are being urged to call an extraordinary general meeting of the Welsh Rugby Union and hold a vote of no confidence in chair Richard Collier-Keywood.

The call comes from a Welsh district, Central Glamorgan Rugby Union. It has written a letter that will be sent out to clubs looking to get the 10% needed to force an extraordinary general meeting (EGM). 

Around 30 of the near-300 clubs in Wales will be required to support the plans.

A previous EGM came in 2023 when the clubs overwhelmingly supported a change in governance, with alterations to the board and the appointment of the first independent chair.

Collier-Keywood was appointed in July 2023 and a new-look board was installed.

Central Glamorgan Rugby Union does not believe change has been achieved and wants a vote of no confidence in Collier-Keywood and Professional Rugby Board (PRB) chair Malcolm Wall, who is also a board member. This is one of three motions proposed.

The district has asked fellow clubs to act to achieve the "necessary change" after the "reputational damage caused to Welsh rugby".

The letter reads: "This new structure of leadership within the WRU has been in place for more than two years.  

"While we acknowledge that the situation on the back of Covid has been challenging, we're deeply concerned the current leadership have not been able to formulate and commence the delivery of a plan that sets our game in Wales on the right track to support the professional, SRC [Super Rygbi Cymru], female and community game. 

"Instead, we see the meandering between different versions of a plan, causing chaos, confusion and uncertainty, spending extortionate amounts of money on external consultants, combined with the current board's inability to define and deliver a clear strategy for rugby in Wales.

"This is causing reputational damage to Welsh rugby across the world when we were once held in such high esteem."

The WRU launched a strategy in October suggesting major change to the Welsh game, which included cutting one of the four men's professional sides.

The governing body has so far failed to achieve that, with more talks expected in the coming weeks.

The clubs had a chance to quiz the WRU hierarchy at November's annual general meeting (AGM) but there was only one query about the professional game raised in a question and answer session.

Central Glamorgan Rugby Union now feels the WRU has to answer questions on its leadership.

It says if the "people paid to do the job have to use consultants to guide them, it begs the question if we have the right personnel in those roles", adding "there are experienced people within Wales who understand the rugby landscape and would willingly offer their time".

The letter continues: "We feel strongly we as clubs and shareholders need to hold the WRU to account and the only mechanism that we have to do that at this moment in time is via an extraordinary general meeting.  

"To call an EGM, we require a minimum of 10% of voting members to support the call for such a meeting.   

"However, we would like to send a stronger message and would therefore encourage clubs to canvass the opinions of their members to get as many member clubs as possible to agree change is needed in accordance with the motions we are putting forward."

Central Glamorgan Rugby Union represents clubs in the Neath, Port Talbot, Maesteg and Bridgend areas and is one of nine districts that help make up the WRU. 

It is proposing three motions, with a document provided for clubs to send straight to the WRU.

The first is a vote of no confidence in WRU chair Collier-Keywood and PRB chair Wall, which would require a majority of more than 50% to pass.

The second motion would be for the WRU council to hold elections for the four elected member board position within 14 days after the EGM, which also requires more than 50% of the vote.

The third motion is to amend how the WRU district and council members are elected, which will require a 75% majority.

In addition, Central Glamorgan Rugby Union is putting forward the following recommendations:

To put an immediate hold on plans to amend the structure of the professional game, with a full review of WRU finances and organisation structure to be undertaken to identify where money can be saved (executive and board salaries, consultants) to support the professional, SRC and community game in Wales.

A rugby steering group to be set up within three weeks comprising of people from the professional, SRC and community game along with business sector. This group will be directed to advise on rugby related matters and negate the need for expensive consultants.

A central national academy to be set up within three months to be totally responsible for the identification and development of talent for male and female players.

Except for the WRU chief executive and chair and the Professional Rugby Board (PRB) chair, no directors (independent non-executive or WRU council members) should be paid.

The new WRU chair and PRB chair appointments should be immersed in Welsh culture, have a strong understanding of Welsh rugby and values, ideally be conversant in the Welsh language and live in Wales.

The WRU say they are "aware of the correspondence from the Central Glamorgan Rugby Union to member clubs".

"The Welsh Rugby Union has a clear governance process in place for these sorts of matters, as set out in our constitution, and we will continue to engage fully with our member clubs to follow that process," said WRU chief executive Abi Tierney.

"At this point, we have not received any formal trigger required to call an extraordinary general meeting under our articles of association.

"We published our plans for the future of the elite game in Wales at the end of October 2025, following an extensive consultation process. 

"We are now focused on rolling out that plan and are working with key stakeholders to agree a consensus on the implementation."

Tierney says the WRU are hoping for resolutions in the coming weeks.

"Detailed work is underway with the professional clubs, the United Rugby Championship and player representatives, and we remain committed to reaching consensus on the next steps in the coming weeks," said Tierney.

"We ask all stakeholders to work with us. We recognise that change is challenging, but it is essential for the long-term health of the game in Wales."

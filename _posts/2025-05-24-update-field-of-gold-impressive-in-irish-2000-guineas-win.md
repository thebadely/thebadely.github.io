Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Field of Gold bounced back from a disappointing showing at Newmarket this month

Field of Gold was a dominant winner of the Irish 2,000 Guineas as the evens favourite finished three and three quarters of a length clear of Cosmic Year at the Curragh.

After a fast-finishing second at the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket this month, jockey Kieran Shoemark was replaced by Colin Keane as Field of Gold matched the feat of his sire, Kingman, who won the race in 2014. 

Starting from wide, the horse trained by John and Thady Gosden emerged from the pack with a few furlongs to spare before sprinting clear of the remainder of the nine-strong field.

Cosmic Year (4-1) came home three quarters of a length ahead of Hotazhell (10-1) in third. 

"It was as good a feel as I've had off a horse in a long time," Keane told RTE Sport. 

"He's just so straightforward and powerful.

"I just stepped in for today, but he seems to be a horse going the right way."

Keane added that he had been in contact with Shoemark before the race.

"Kieran is an absolute gentleman.

"He put me straight and told me everything I need to know. I'm very thankful for that."

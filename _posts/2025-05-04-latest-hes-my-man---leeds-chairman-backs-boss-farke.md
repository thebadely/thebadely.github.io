Let's dive into the details: Leeds United chairman Paraag Marath celebrates with boss Daniel Farke after they won the Championship title on Saturday

Leeds United chairman Paraag Marathe has said he has "ended speculation" over the future of manager Daniel Farke by confirming the German is "my man".

The Whites secured promotion back to the Premier League two weeks ago and won the Championship title with a 2-1 victory at Plymouth on Saturday.

Despite their stellar campaign, which saw them reach 100 points, there were some reports the club were considering changing manager in the summer.

"I'm very excited to run it back with Daniel and collaborate with him," Marathe told BBC Radio Leeds.

"I'm under no illusions that it is going to be easy. The past two seasons the three promoted teams came straight back down but we have something they don't have, we have Daniel Farke first of all."

Asked whether he had ended the question marks over the manager, Marathe responded: "I have ended the speculation. He is my man."

This season's title was the third time that Farke, who has two years left on his contract, has finished top of the second tier, having previously twice finished top with Norwich.

He has found life in the Premier League far tougher though, with his only full season at that level ending with a bottom-placed finish, before he was sacked in November of his second campaign in the top flight with Norwich in the relegation zone.

Marathe had said previously that Farke had not been given the financial backing required to compete before, and that would not be the case this time.

"Together we are going to build the best squad we can, with every penny we are allowed to spend to be competitive in the Premier League," the American said.

"We are going to attack the transfer market and it's something I'm really excited about."

Marathe: 'He is my man'

Leeds secured the title thanks to a run of six successive wins - after a stretch of just one victory in their previous six matches.

Marathe praised Farke's temperament in guiding the club back up to the top flight after two seasons in the Championship.

"He is such a calming force - presence would be an understatement," Marathe said.

"He really has a superpower that way. He told you all he was 100% confident we were going to the Prem after the draw with Swansea, and he believed it and I love him for it.

"He has that conviction and belief and I told him privately that I was looking forward to moving forward together, but I didn't feel like it was my time to speak because someone wanted to put out a rumour."

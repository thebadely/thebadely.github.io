According to new developments, More than 100 volunteers have gathered in an east London community hall to wrap thousands of Christmas presents for children across the capital, with organisers saying for some, it would be the only gift they would get this year.

The Kindness Offensive, a charity that redistributes donated goods to schools, food banks and community groups, was behind the gift drive.

David Goodfellow, the event's organiser, said the project was focused on children from families facing hardship.

"For a lot of the children we are helping today, what they get from this project, what they get from the Kindness Offensive, is going to be the only thing they get for Christmas," he said.

The gifts were donated by companies before being wrapped and loaded onto a red bus for delivery across the capital.

One volunteer said the event was about more than presents, and more about giving children hope.

Another woman said the event was a way to end the year "on a high".

Dominic Twomey, leader of Barking and Dagenham Council, said child poverty remained a serious issue in the borough.

"We have four in 10 of our children under the age of 16 living in poverty," he said, and added the gifts helped ease pressure on parents at a difficult time of year.

The bus delivering the presents made a stop at Becontree Primary School in Dagenham on Wednesday.

Pupils there did not know a surprise was waiting for them, said head teacher Marie Ziane.

"Not one of them who are going to come into the hall know about this," she said.

"I'm really looking forward to the surprise on their faces."

Organisers said the aim of the Kindness Offensive was to ensure no child felt forgotten at Christmas, particularly as families continue to struggle with the cost of living.

Volunteers said they hoped the gifts would bring some joy to children who might otherwise go without.

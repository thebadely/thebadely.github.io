Let's dive into the details: Thousands of bikers have ridden in a "joyous" celebration of the life of Hairy Bikers presenter Dave Myers.

Thousands of motorcyclists descended on Barrow in Cumbria on Saturday, the hometown of the 66-year-old TV chef, who died from cancer last year.

His widow Lili Myers said the turnout for Dave Day 2 "surpassed all expectations" and added, "they [the bikers] keep coming".

Hairy Bikers co-star, Si King, said the event, a repeat of the biking procession for Myers last year, was a "joyous celebration of me best mate".

Last year's event saw more than 20,000 bikers travel from London and raised £127,000 for charities the NSPCC and the Institute of Cancer Research.

King said: "Last year was fantastic and this year is amazing. It's a culmination of what motorcycles are about - community, friendship and fellowship".

Mrs Myers echoed her late husband's co-star and said there was "so much joy" at the gathering. 

"It's a feeling of energy, celebration and that's what's important, that's what we wanted to bring in Barrow," she told the BBC.

"We had a figure in our heads, but it's surpassed all expectations... so I'm not going to say anything because they [the bikers] keep on coming".

The two-day celebration involves entertainment on Saturday and Sunday as well as a concert and a charity football match, with tickets priced £10 for each event.

Westmorland and Furness Council had warned of congestion around junction 36 of the M6, with Dave Day motorcyclists arriving in Barrow from mid-afternoon.

The procession came via the A590 from the M6, turning left on to Park Road at entry into Barrow and proceeded to the town centre through Abbey Road.

Barriers and designated crossing points were in place, which people were urged to use by the council, with help from marshals and signs.

National Highways has told drivers to allow more time for their journeys and to plan ahead as "thousands more bikers than usual" were expected on the motorway over the weekend.

"It is anticipated the M6 will be particularly busy, especially at Knutsford Services, where motorcyclists travelling from the south will gather before completing their journeys north," a spokesperson said.

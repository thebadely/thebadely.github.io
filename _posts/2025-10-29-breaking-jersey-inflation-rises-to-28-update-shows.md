Let's dive into the details: The rate at which prices are rising in Jersey increased in the months between June and September, according to a new report.

Statistics Jersey released the latest Retail Prices Index (RPI) report, which showed that prices in the island rose by 2.8% over the 12 months to September.

It said the increase was due to the rising costs of food, driving and leisure - which included entertainment, sport and holidays off-island.

The government said it would use RPI figures to help make decisions about things such as pensions and benefits, and businesses use them to plan for future costs.

Tobacco was the largest spending group affected by inflation, closely followed by leisure services and then motoring.

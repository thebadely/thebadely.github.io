It has been recently reported that Germany have won the Women's Euros a record eight times

Germany will host the 2029 Women's European Championship, Uefa has announced.

The governing body's president Aleksander Ceferin said Germany's bid had come out ahead of Poland and a joint bid from Denmark and Sweden.

Ceferin, who was speaking at a meeting of Uefa's executive committee in Nyon, Switzerland, said it was "heartbreaking" that any of the three bids should lose, before he pulled Germany's name out of the envelope.

The summer tournament will feature 16 national teams and be played across eight venues in Cologne, Dortmund, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Hanover, Leipzig, Munich and Wolfsburg.

Portugal and Italy also submitted dossiers to host the tournament but withdrew to focus on bids to co-host the men's Euro 2032 and 2030 men's World Cup.

Germany were ultimately convincing winners, receiving 15 votes from committee members, with Denmark and Sweden receiving two and Poland getting none.

The 2029 finals will mark the third time that eight-time winners Germany have hosted the event.

They staged it in 2001 and as West Germany in 1989, winning on both occasions.

"It was a long journey. We have so many people working at DFB [German football association] to get this tournament," said the German governing body's president Bernd Neuendorf.

"Thanks to all who supported us, we felt this support throughout the campaign."

Switzerland hosted Euro 2025, with England beating Spain on penalties in the final following a tense 1-1 draw to retain their trophy.

England are therefore targeting a hat-trick of Euros titles in 2029, with Germany the only team to have ever triumphed at more than two consecutive editions of the tournament - reeling off six in a row from 1995 to 2013.

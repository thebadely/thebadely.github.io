Oleksandr Usyk (right) has won all four fights as a professional on UK soil

Oleksandr Usyk further cemented his place as one of boxing's greats by stopping Daniel Dubois in round five to become a two-time undisputed heavyweight champion.

The Ukrainian put on a masterclass in front of 90,000 fans at Wembley Stadium to dash Dubois' dreams of being the first Briton to unify the division in the four-belt era.

Usyk, 38, put Dubois down twice in the fifth and the Londoner was unable to return to beat the count the second time round.

He also stopped Dubois in 2023 and extended his perfect record as a professional to 24 victories.

"I'm sorry [Dubois], it's sport. My people wanted this win," Usyk told DAZN.

"Nothing is next. It's enough. Next, I want to rest. My family, my wife, my children, I want to rest now. Two or three months, I want to just rest."

Dubois - who beat Anthony Joshua to defend his IBF title in September - tasted defeat for the third time in 25 contests as a professional, with each of those losses coming inside the distance.

Usyk reclaimed the IBF title, which was stripped from him just weeks after unifying the division in 2023, and added it to his WBA (Super), WBO and WBC belts.

"I have to commend him on the performance, I gave everything I had. Take no credit away from that man, I'll be back," Dubois told DAZN.

"I was just fighting, trying to pick up round by round. It is what it is."

Usyk has now won all 13 of his world title fights across two divisions

The great and good of the boxing world turned out to watch the momentous occasion, with Roy Jones Jr and Frank Bruno among those at ringside.

WBO interim heavyweight champion Joseph Parker was also keeping a close eye on proceedings as he seeks a date with the champion next.

Usyk, who has called the UK his second home, was welcomed warmly after Dubois had also been cheered to the ring.

It took no time for the fight to spark into life as the Briton doubled up on his jab but it was clear Usyk wasn't going to be a sitting target. The former undisputed cruiserweight champion was far too slick, ducking under the jab and punishing his rival regularly.

Southpaw Usyk punctuated each of the opening two rounds with a counter left and had his younger opponent looking a little unsteady in the second.

Dubois looked out of the ring to his father Stan between rounds for some advice but he still found it difficult to pin down the 2012 Olympic gold medallist.

Usyk was in full flow by the fifth round and sent him tumbling to the canvas with a crisp right to the temple.

Dubois showed incredible spirit to beat the count but the writing was already on the wall.

A trusty left hook landed clean on his chin and his corner threw in the towel as the referee reached the count of nine.

Usyk has now beaten Anthony Joshua, Tyson Fury and Daniel Dubois twice

A third career defeat leaves Dubois in a difficult position and requiring another rebuild.

The 27-year-old has not beaten a champion to claim a world title - he won the interim IBF belt and was subsequently elevated to full world champion before making one defence against Joshua.

Following his last defeat by Usyk, Dubois re-emerged with a newfound confidence but this loss will knock him back several steps.

He will have no shortage of options, though, with the likes of interim WBC champion Agit Kabayel, WBA 'Regular' champion Kubrat Pulev or even the likes of Deontay Wilder to go after.

Usyk, meanwhile, is the A side in boxing's glamour division and can take his pick.

"Maybe it's Tyson Fury. Maybe we have three choices, Derek Chisora and Anthony Joshua, maybe Joseph Parker," Usyk told DAZN.

Dubois' team raised concerns over Usyk's age during fight week but he looked as good as ever.

As he has done in all previous rematches - against Fury and Joshua - Usyk used the data he had downloaded from the first encounter to his advantage.

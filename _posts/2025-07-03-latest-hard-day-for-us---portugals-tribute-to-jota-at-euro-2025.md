It has been recently reported that Fans held posters and signs up in the stadium to pay tribute to Jota

"Of course, if we had the possibility to change everything, we would change everything for sure. But this is a hard day for us."

Portugal boss Francisco Neto joined in the tributes to Diogo Jota as thousands of fans also paid their respects during the team's Euro 2025 opener against Spain.

Liverpool forward Jota and his brother, Andre Silva, both died early on Thursday morning when the Lamborghini car they were travelling in crashed in the Spanish province of Zamora.

On an emotional evening, a heartfelt rendition of Portugal's national anthem was followed by an impeccably observed minute's silence before kick-off, during which a black-and-white image of Jota was displayed on the big stadium screens in Bern.

"It was a really tough day to play football, because this life is much more than a game, much more than football," said Portugal forward Jessica Silva.

"Of course everyone is sad. It's heavy, my heart is heavy - much more important things than playing a game."

Portugal fans held up placards with messages paying tribute to the player who is also being mourned in Liverpool, while both sets of players wore black armbands.

Despite having relentless support from their fans throughout the 90 minutes, Portugal fell to a 5-0 defeat in Bern as world champions and tournament favourites Spain began their pursuit for a first European crown.

Speaking in his post-match news conference, coach Neto, who appeared to hold back tears during the minute's silence, described Jota as a devoted supporter of the women's side.

"Diogo followed our team because he loved the county," said Neto, who explained he first met Jota while coaching at under-19 level.

"Diogo always, when I talked to him, always knew the result. He followed the team, some players and this is the culture we have in Portugal.

"Today is a really, really sad day because two of us lost our lives. So young. It is not a good day."

'A symbol of hope & inspiration - Jota was a Portuguese hero'

Players held up a banner with a message that translates as 'Thank you for everything Diogo Jota. Rest in peace'

Before the game, Portugal winger Silva posted a tribute on social media, saying: "Diogo wasn't just a great player. He was one of the good ones â loyal, thoughtful, humble.

"Football is poorer without him, and so are we."

After the game, she added: "I knew Diogo and he was a really kind person - much more than a player, much more than a star, he was a guy always paying attention, always ready to give a word for the team and well, it's sad."

After the final whistle, the Portugal players lined up together to hold a banner to mark Joto's death. Its message - "Thank you for everything Diogo Jota, rest in peace" - was reflected by the sombre feeling in the squad.

Jota made his senior debut for Portugal in 2019 and went on to score 14 goals in 49 internationals, being a member of two squads that won Nations League titles - the second of those victories came only last month.

"As a person he was very humble, very kind and he liked us and was always watching us and rooting for us. He meant a lot to us and it's very sad," Portugal forward Diana Silva added.

"He's one of us, so I think the team is feeling the moment quite a bit."

News of the tragic deaths overshadowed the build-up to Portugal's tournament opener.

Despite trying to soak up the atmosphere in Bern's fan zone, Portugal supporters struggled to process the news.

Portugal fan Melanie, who had tickets for the game, fought back tears as she said:  "I can't explain it, but as soon as I heard it I started crying.

"He's one of us of course, but the question is he was so young, he had three kids, he just got married.

"I'm so sorry. You just start thinking, you really have to enjoy your life because in three seconds, everything can end."

Jota recently married his long-term partner Rute Cardoso, with whom he had three children. He posted pictures on social media of the ceremony, which took place on 22 June.

Diogo, a Portugal fan who shared his name with the player, said the news "hurts a lot", adding: "He was really important, he was the new generation, the golden generation of Portugal. We will miss him."

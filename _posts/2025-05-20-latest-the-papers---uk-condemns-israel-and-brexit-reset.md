Experts revealed that The EU deal is on all of Tuesday's front pages. The Daily Mail describes it as "Starmer's surrender", and accuses the prime minister of handing Brussels control of British laws, money and fish. 

The Daily Express thinks it's a "betrayal of Brexit Britain" - and calls it "Remain by the back door".

"Done up like a kipper" is the Sun's headline. It says the UK was ambushed by a late demand for, as the paper puts it, "12 more years of French and Spanish trawlers plundering our waters". 

Matt's cartoon in the Daily Telegraph shows fishermen on board a British-flagged trawler saying "We took back control, but they took back all the mackerel, sole and haddock". The front page headline is "Kiss goodbye to Brexit!"

The i Paper accepts there was a "climbdown" by the UK on fishing, but it says Britain has "won" with its deals on defence and food. 

The Daily Mirror focuses on what it calls "practical benefits" - faster passport checks and less red tape for business.

The Guardian headline quotes Sir Keir Starmer saying Britain is "back on the world stage".

The Times editorial says the reset with the EU has come at a cost - particularly with the political attacks about fishing - but it argues that "voters want pragmatism, and Sir Keir has supplied it". 

The Financial believes it is neither a massive sell-out nor a massive deal - but is a "worthwhile step". The paper says it wants to now see a more ambitious realignment with what is still Britain's most important trade and security partner.

The Daily Telegraph says Labour is set to postpone its women's conference, saying the party is in "chaos" about the Supreme Court ruling on biological sex. 

It says confidential advice sent to members of Labour's National Executive Committee recommends that they cancel the event in order to avoid legal action and political embarrassment.

The early departure of Gary Lineker from the BBC prompts headlines in the Daily Express about "full-time" and an "own goal". 

The Mirror's editorial says it is right that he parts ways with the BBC after his latest controversial post on social media. 

The Sun says Lineker's announcement will spark an intense rivalry over who will lead World Cup coverage. 

Finally, the Daily Star says the man himself is tipped to switch to ITV on "even more money".

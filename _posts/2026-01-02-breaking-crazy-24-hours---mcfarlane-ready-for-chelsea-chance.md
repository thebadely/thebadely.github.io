According to new developments, Calum McFarlane joined Chelsea from Southampton 

Chelsea interim manager Calum McFarlane admits it's been a "whirlwind" 24 hours since he was named as temporary replacement for Enzo Maresca.

Italian Maresca parted company with the Blues on Thursday, 18 months after replacing Mauricio Pochettino at Stamford Bridge. 

McFarlane, Chelsea's U21s head coach, was named as interim manager and will take charge of Sunday's Premier League trip to Manchester City. 

Such was the unexpected nature of McFarlane's appointment, the Englishman's training ground pass had to be amended to grant him access to the club's press conference room on Friday morning. 

"It's been a crazy 24 hours, a whirlwind, as you can imagine, but also really enjoyable and really exciting," said McFarlane.

"I can only feel positive about it. It's an amazing experience."

McFarlane to take on Guardiola - but who is he?

'Good idea' or taking 'massive chance' - is Rosenior ready for Chelsea?

He added: "I am quite relaxed. I am sure as we get closer to the game it will become more nerve-wracking. I haven't worked at this level before but the lads have been brilliant and we will do this together."

Maresca's departure came after a 2-2 draw against Bournemouth on Tuesday, which left the Blues 15 points adrift of leaders Arsenal. 

It means McFarlane's debut as a manager of a senior team will come against Pep Guardiola, who celebrated managing his 1,000th match as a head coach in November. 

"The team needs to be ready and prepared and our role is giving the players the support they need to go and execute," he said. 

"I wouldn't say we have nothing to lose. We have to give a real good account of ourselves."

Chelsea travel to Manchester three places and 11 points behind second-placed City. 

Reports following Maresca's departure suggested the Italian had held talks with City over succeeding Guardiola, though the former Leicester City boss denied the claims. 

"From my point of view Chelsea have lost an incredible manager and an incredible person," Guardiola said on Maresca's departure.

"It's a decision from the Chelsea hierarchy so I've nothing to say. How lucky I am in the club where I am. My club is extraordinary."

Asked about his own future, Guardiola - whose current deal runs until the end of the 2026-27 season - said: "I have one more year.

"I've been here for 10 years and I promise you I will leave one day but I have a contract, I'm happy, I want to fight with my team, the hierarchy respect me - they proved last season when we didn't win one game in three months."

Here’s what you need to know: Stuart shares frontline tighthead duties at Bath with South Africa Rugby World Cup winner Thomas Du Toit, who is in his final season at the club

Prop Will Stuart is a serious doubt for the start of England's Six Nations campaign after sustaining a suspected Achilles tendon injury in Bath's 40-14 victory over Munster in the Champions Cup on Saturday.

Stuart hobbled off in the 49th minute and left the Recreation Ground in a protective boot.

"He's not in a good way. It looks like it's his Achilles," said Bath head of rugby Johan van Graan.

"I'm no medical expert, but he couldn't even stand up when he got pulled off the field.

"I'll receive an update later, but it looks very serious."

Stuart came off the bench against Australia, New Zealand and Argentina as head coach Steve Borthwick's strong set of replacements steered England to victory.

What did we learn from the Champions Cup's opening weekend?

Did the Champions Cup opening weekend deliver?

Joe Heyes, who started ahead of British and Irish Lions tourist Stuart at tighthead, was one of England's star performers last month.

However, Asher Opoku-Fordjour, another option at three, is currently out of action with an elbow injury that will keep him sidelined until early to mid January.

Gloucester's Afolabi Fasogbon and Stuart's Bath team-mate Billy Sela featured for England A over the autumn, while Northampton's Trevor Davison, who won his first cap in almost four years against the United States in the summer, would be a more experienced option.

England's opening game of the Six Nations is at home to Wales on 7 February.

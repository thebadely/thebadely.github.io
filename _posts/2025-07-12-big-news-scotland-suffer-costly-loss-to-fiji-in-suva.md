Let's dive into the details: George Horne and Ollie Smith try to stop an advancing Fijian

Fiji: 29 (15) 

Tries: Ikanivere, Ravouvou, Wainiqolo, Penalty Try Cons: Muntz 2 Pens: Muntz

Scotland: 14 (7) 

Tries: Rowe, Jordan Cons: Burke 2 

Darcy Graham was sent off as Scotland suffered a bruising loss to four-try Fiji in Suva, with their hopes of getting a favourable World Cup draw seriously dented.

Despite scoring after only three minutes, the Scots spent most of the game on the back foot, conceding penalty after penalty.

Graham was sin-binned in the first half for tackling a player before he had the ball and saw red after a second yellow-card infringement, which also resulted in a penalty try.

The loss to Fiji, ranked ninth in the world, will cost Scotland world rankings points and likely push them outside the top six when the World Cup draw is made in December.

Taking on Fiji in their own back yard was never going to be an easy feat, but Scotland got off to the best possible start as Graham put Kyle Rowe through a gap with the full-back scoring after only three minutes.

That was about as good as it got for the visitors. Marched back by repeated infringements and ferocious ball-carrying, hooker Ewan Ashman was binned and Caleb Muntz kicked a penalty.

The final five minutes of the first half were costly. Graham was carded and Fiji scored twice to take the lead at the break.

Firstly, a Fijian line-out crashed through the Scottish barricades and captain Tevita Ikanivere touched down. Moments later, they had another line-out deep in Scotland's camp, but this time they went wide and winger Kalaveti Ravouvou cantered over.

Into the second-half and again it was the Scots who drew first blood. Ashman broke and was tap-tackled just short, but the ball was shovelled wide for Tom Jordan to score. Fergus Burke nailed the conversion and the gap was narrowed to one point.

Scotland would not be back in point-scoring territory for a long time.

Jiuta Wainiqolo's individual magic put the hosts back in the driving seat, with the Toulon winger dancing through three tackles on his way to the line.

Graham's red card really ended the game for Scotland. Trying to intercept on his own line, he was too eager and went early. In an offside position, he was the only defender and, although he intercepted and cleared, it was brought back for a penalty try and a second yellow.

Although the visitors were able to get into the Fijian 22m a few times, the damage was done and now Scotland face another tough World Cup group in 2027.

'What a performance!' Zhao beats O'Sullivan with session to spare

Seven-time champion Ronnie O'Sullivan suffered a 17-7 loss to a dominant Zhao Xintong as his World Championship semi-final came to an end a session early.

Zhao, 28, becomes only the second player from Asia to reach a Crucible final, nine years after his Chinese compatriot Ding Junhui was runner-up to Mark Selby in 2016.

Leading 12-4, Zhao compiled breaks of 62 and 128 to dash any hopes O'Sullivan had of building some momentum after taking the first two frames of Friday's evening session.

While O'Sullivan, who is level on seven Crucible crowns in the modern era with Stephen Hendry, took the first frame after the mid-session interval, Zhao exhibited an incredible temperament to round off the match. 

In front of a crowd overwhelmingly urging 49-year-old O'Sullivan to take the contest into Saturday, Zhao compiled breaks of 85, 63 and 88 to seal the most famous victory of his career.

"I can't believe that. I need to say thank you to Ronnie because he has helped me a lot before. He's my idol," Zhao told BBC Sport.

"It's my first time playing on the single table here, it's an amazing time for me and I just want to enjoy it because I don't know how many times I can try to enjoy it here.

"I've played here and sometimes the crowd is helpful for Ronnie and he deserves that, he is a legend here so I needed to control myself."

Zhao's scintillating showing on Friday morning laid the platform when he became only the fourth player to win a session 8-0 against O'Sullivan at the Crucible.

It was reminiscent of the form he displayed on his way to the UK title in 2021 and he was able to maintain that later in the day to become only the second player since John Parrott in 1994 to defeat O'Sullivan with a session to spare at snooker's most famous venue.

O'Sullivan, who has won a record 41 ranking events, has made no secret about struggling with his cue since snapping his old one at the Championship League in January.

He turned up for his first-round match against Ali Carter with two cues from different manufacturers and has been constantly tinkering ever since.

That included two mid-match changes to his tip against Zhao and switching his ferrule from titanium to brass.

However, it did not have the desired impact as he missed a series of regulation pots against an opponent who punished him in ruthless fashion.

"I just felt like I never gave him a game so that's a bit disappointing," said O'Sullivan.

"Zhao deserved his victory. I think he's done brilliantly all tournament and all credit to Zhao. He played better than me."

Ronnie O'Sullivan has only lost one other match at the Crucible before the scheduled final session

In the afternoon session in Sheffield, Judd Trump looked set to establish a big lead when he pulled 7-3 ahead of Mark Williams, but the veteran Welshman reined in the 2019 champion to leave the pair at 8-8 overnight.

Trump, whose glory run six years ago gave him his only Crucible crown to date, extended his overnight lead from 5-3 by taking the opening two frames.

But Welshman Williams, 50, who is aiming to become the oldest ever Crucible finalist, rallied to take five of the next six frames on offer.

Just as in their keenly-contested 2022 semi-final, which Trump edged 17-16, the tension was palpable.

It was underlined by Williams uncharacteristically hitting his own cue in frustration when he thought he had given up the opportunity to win the 15th frame, in which he eventually triumphed before rounding off the session with a composed 96.

"Absolute carnage. Amazing snooker," said six-time world champion Steve Davis on BBC Two.

"Mark Williams looked edgy early on, but as the session panned out he got calmer and calmer. Judd Trump must be wondering what is going on - it's not his fault, but Mark Williams is playing the best snooker he has all week."  

Their semi-final will get back under way at 10:00 BST on Saturday and finish in the evening session.

John Higgins and Graeme Dott both whitewashed O'Sullivan in sessions on their way to Crucible titles in 1998 and 2006, while Parrott did the same back in 1994 on only O'Sullivan's second appearance in snooker's blue-riband event.

However, to see it happen on O'Sullivan's 33rd appearance at the event only served to underline his comments - dismissed in some quarters - that he had only reached this last-four stage because of shortcomings of his previous opponents.

His problems from long range were particularly evident against Carter, Pang Junxu and Si Jiahui, but he also toiled when presented with good opportunities to make sizeable contributions of his own.

The decision to change the ferrule on his cue - the metal part of the cue near the top which affects the amount of side and swerve you can apply to the white - from titanium to the more traditional brass did not reap any rewards.

Instead, Zhao, who O'Sullivan has mentored at times, showcased his full repertoire of shots and by the end of Friday had remarkably achieved his 46th victory from 48 matches since returning from a 20-month ban.

He was one 10 players from China sanctioned in a match-fixing scandal. While Zhao did not directly throw a match, he accepted charges of being a party to another player fixing two matches and betting on matches himself.

As a result of that suspension he lost his place on the World Snooker Tour, and he had to win four qualifying matches to earn a Crucible spot. 

On this evidence he could return to the professional tour as world champion next term.

O'Sullivan called his decision to compete in Sheffield the "bravest" of his career after suffering "stage fright" and not playing competitively since snapping his cue at the Championship League in January.

He pulled out of the Masters at Alexandra Palace on medical grounds, missed the German Masters in Berlin and apologised to fans after electing not to play at the Welsh Open.

He also withdrew from the World Grand Prix in Hong Kong in March and previously said he has had to take medication to deal with anxiety.

His candid studio discussion with Mark Selby on TNT Sports, external earlier this season also shone a light on the mental health pressures faced by snooker players.

Yet despite preparation that was far from ideal and his own protestations over his form, O'Sullivan deserves huge credit for finding his way through into a record-extending 14th appearance in the last four.

O'Sullivan memorably defended his world crown in 2013, despite playing one competitive match prior to the showpiece event after taking an extended break from snooker that season.

However, aside from having to try to play himself into form at an event that is regarded the sport's acid test, one of his major obstacles this time has been his dissatisfaction with his cue.

Ken Doherty, 1997 world champion: "They [Trump and Williams] will look on the other side of the draw and think that the greatest player to ever play the game is out - and well beaten. 

"They will have watched how well Zhao played and they'll know whoever gets through will be up against a tough opponent, one who's playing so carefree, very relaxed and probably doesn't realise the situation he's in - because he's just absolutely loving it."

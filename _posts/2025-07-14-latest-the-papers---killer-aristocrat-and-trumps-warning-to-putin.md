According to new developments, The Sun says the BBC and the production company Banijay asked John Torode to resign as a Masterchef presenter, after he was accused of making a racist remark. According to a source close to him, they suggested he should say he was going for "mental health reasons" - but that he rejected that. BBC insiders say they don't recognise those claims. The Daily Mirror says Gregg Wallace is warning that there will be more "casualties" if the BBC chooses to protect its legacy, rather than protect people. 

The Times says the Culture Secretary says confidence in the BBC under Tim Davie has been called into question by a "series of failures". The Matt cartoon in the Daily Telegraph shows a television report about the Corporation, with the newsreader saying "the Director General should look away now if he doesn't want to know how this ends".

Several papers lead with Donald Trump's tougher message to Russia about the Ukraine war. The Daily Telegraph says his announcement on weapons and tariffs represents "the most concrete threat to Vladimir Putin over his refusal to sign up to a peace deal". The Financial Times says Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with his Russian counterpart's "intransigence".

The Times leads with new grants being offered by the government to help increase sales of electric cars. It says motorists could save up to Â£3,750 - with the biggest discounts applying to British-made vehicles.

Let's dive into the details: A 53-year-old man has been arrested after a car hit a number of pedestrians in Liverpool city centre during the Premier League victory parade.

Eyewitnesses and videos shared on social media have shown the vehicle driving through a crowd as people scatter.

Details are still emerging but here is what we know so far. 

A car collided with a number of pedestrians on Water Street just after 18:00,  Merseyside Police said.

In a statement the force said: "We were contacted at just after 18:00 today, Monday 26 May, following reports a car had been in collision with a number of pedestrians on Water Street.

"The car stopped at the scene and a male has been detained."

Police later said a 53-year-old white British man from the Liverpool area had been arrested and that he was believed to be the driver. 

The incident is not being treated as terror-related and is believed to be isolated, police said.

The ambulance service said 27 people had been taken to hospital for treatment, with two, including one child, seriously injured.

Another 20 people were treated for injuries at the scene.

Four children were among the injured.

Four people including a child were lifted from beneath the car, Merseyside chief fire  Nick Searle said.

Video from the scene shows the car ploughing into the a group of people then speeding up before coming to a halt.

Other footage shows people striking the car after it stopped, with the back windscreen shattered.

Numerous emergency service vehicles attended the scene.

One eyewitness, BBC reporter Matt Cole, described seeing a car coming through the crowd that "just wasn't stopping". 

He said it was being chased by a group of men "who were trying to bang on the side of it and throw things at it".

He estimated the car was travelling at "more than 20 [mph]".

He said his initial assumption was that the driver just wanted to "barge through crowds because they didn't want to wait".

Another witness, Matthew O'Carroll, 28, from Runcorn, saw the car approaching the top of Water Street.

He said the vehicle had been going at a "decent" speed and that the driver had been beeping as he went through the crowd.

Water Street is near the Strand, where moments before the incident occurred Liverpool FC had paraded the Premier League trophy from the top of a bus.

Thousands of people had come out to celebrate the team's victory. The incident happened about a mile before the parade's finishing point.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is being kept updated on the latest developments.

He posted on X: "The scenes in Liverpool are appalling - my thoughts are with all those injured or affected.

"I want to thank the police and emergency services for their swift and ongoing response to this shocking incident."

Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the pictures were "deeply worrying". 

"My thoughts are with all those affected, and the emergency services as they respond to what appears a horrific incident," she said.

Liverpool FC said it was in contact with the police and its "thoughts and prayers are with those who have been affected by this serious incident", while rivals Everton FC echoed the sentiment.

Liverpool said in a statement: "Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have been affected by this serious incident. We will continue to offer our full support to the emergency services and local authorities who are dealing with this incident."

Liverpool's staff celebrations are understood to have been postponed because of the incident.

The Premier League has also released a statement, saying "everyone at the Premier League is shocked by the appalling events in Liverpool this evening, and our heartfelt thoughts go out to all those injured and affected.

"We have been in contact with Liverpool FC and have offered our full support following this serious incident."

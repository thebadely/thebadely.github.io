Experts revealed that A miniature dachshund has been found alive and well after spending more than 500 days in the Australian wilderness.

Kangala Wildlife Rescue said it had been working "around the clock" to find the dog, Valerie, on Kangaroo Island, off the coast of Australia. She was last seen by her owners on a camping trip in November 2023. 

Georgia Gardner and her boyfriend, Joshua Fishlock, had momentarily left Valerie in a playpen at their campsite while the couple went fishing. When they returned, she was gone. 

Valerie's 529 days in the wilderness - surviving intense heat and avoiding venomous snakes - was brought to an end in part through using Ms Gardner's t-shirt to create a "scent trail" to a trap.

"After weeks of tireless efforts [...] Valerie has been safely rescued and is fit and well," Kangala said in a social media post.

The charity said volunteers spent more than 1,000 hours searching for Valerie, covering more than 5,000km (3,109 miles).

The rescue effort included surveillance cameras and a trap cage with a remote door system filled with food, Ms Gardner's clothes and some of Valerie's toys from home.

Lisa Karran, a director of Kangala, said she wore the remnants of Ms Gardner's clothes as she approached Valerie after the dog had been trapped, and sat with her until the dog was "completely calm". 

In the initial days after Valerie went missing, other campers spotted her underneath a parked car which startled the dog and sent her fleeing into bushland, the Washington Post reported.

Months later, island locals reported seeing a pink collar that matched Valerie's, much to the surprise of Jared Karran, another Kangala director.

"Of all dogs, that would be the last one I would say would survive out there, but they do have a good sense of smell," Mr Karran said. 

In a 15-minute video on social media, Mr and Ms Karran explained how the "rollercoaster" rescue had transpired.

Ms Karran said they had to wait until Valerie was in the right part of the trap and calm enough to ensure she would not attempt another escape. 

"She went right into the back corner, which is where we wanted her. I pressed the button and thankfully it all worked perfectly," Mr Karran said.

"I know people were a little bit frustrated, like 'why is it taking so long?' But these are the things that we were doing in the background," he said.

Ms Gardner said on social media after Valerie's long-awaited rescue: "For anyone who's ever lost a pet, your feelings are valid and never give up hope.

"Sometimes good things happen to good people."

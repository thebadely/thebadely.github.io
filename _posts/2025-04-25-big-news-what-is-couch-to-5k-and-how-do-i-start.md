According to new developments, Couch to 5K is a free beginner-friendly running plan from BBC Sport and the government's Department of Health and Social Care.

The nine-week structured programme has got hundreds of thousands of people from being non-runners to be able to complete 5km.

NHS Couch to 5K - the ground-breaking free fitness app developed in partnership with BBC Sport - has had more than seven million downloads since its launch in 2016.

Here are ways to download the NHS Couch to 5K app:

The app assists newcomers to run three times a week, guiding beginners through a gradual transition from couch-bound spectators to confident runners.

Once users graduate from the nine-week programme, they can unlock access to Beyond Couch to 5K. This new feature will help motivate people to make running habitual, and aid them to improve further on speed, stamina and technique.

The Department of Health and Social Care says regular running has been shown to reduce the risk of long-term illnesses, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes and stroke, as well as helping to maintain a healthier weight and improve mood and wellbeing.

The Couch to 5K Podcast hosted by Giovanna Fletcher is available now

BBC Sport has also launched a new podcast on BBC Sounds - The Couch to 5K Podcast - presented by Giovanna Fletcher.

In the opening episodes, Fletcher is joined by BBC Radio 2 presenter Jo Whiley, TikTok star Charley Marlowe, and Lindsey Burrow - the widow of rugby legend Rob.

Fletcher said: "Being part of The Couch to 5K Podcast has been such a joy. Running can do wonders for your mind and body, and this podcast is all about offering support, motivation and a friendly voice to keep you going - no matter where you are on your journey."

MP Ashley Dalton, minister for public health and prevention, said: "As part of our Plan for Change, we are committed to preventing ill health before it starts, including breaking down barriers to exercise and getting the nation fitter.

"The NHS Couch to 5K App is a brilliant example of this - it offers exactly what we all need: support, encouragement and a friendly voice cheering you on at every step."

Whiley, who features in episode one of the new podcast, once disliked running but is now a coach for the Couch to 5K app.

"It's one of the best things I've ever done in my career - 100%," said Whiley.

"I have been at so many different festivals where such a variety of people of all different shapes and sizes and fitness abilities come over to me and saying 'Couch to 5K! It's changed my life!'"

The first episode of The Couch to 5K Podcast is available on BBC Sounds now.  Further episodes will be released weekly from 5 May.

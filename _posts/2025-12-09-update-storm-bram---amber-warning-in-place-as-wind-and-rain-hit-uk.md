Here’s what you need to know: Severe weather warnings including an amber warning have come into force as Storm Bram sweeps across the United Kingdom.

Gusts of up to 90mph (144km/h) are likely across north-west Scotland but strong winds will be felt widely into Wednesday.

Heavy rain will also lead to localised flooding particularly in Wales and south-west England, where ground conditions remain saturated from recent rainfall.

There is the possibility of damage and transport disruption.

Amber warning from the Met Office for strong winds on Tuesday

Storm Bram - named by Met Eireann, Ireland's equivalent of the Met Office - will develop rapidly on Tuesday, moving north to the west of the UK but bringing heavy rain and strengthening winds for all.

The strongest winds will be around Irish Sea coasts and up to the north-west of Scotland where severe gales are possible later on Tuesday.

A Met Office amber warning for wind, valid from 16:00 to 23:59 GMT on Tuesday covers north-west Scotland where gusts of up to 90mph (144km/h) are possible for some locations.

Impacts will include delays and cancellations to some of the transport network as well as potential damage to some buildings.

Yellow wind and rain warnings have been issued by the Met Office

Yellow warnings have also been issued. The first came into force across west Wales and south-west England from 22:00 Monday to 16:00 GMT on Tuesday with wind gusts widely 40-50mph (64-80km/h).

But additionally, yellow warnings will cover Northern Ireland from 09:00 to 21:00 GMT on Tuesday and much of Scotland and north-west England from 12:00  on Tuesday to 06:00 GMT on Wednesday.

Gusts of 50-60mph (80-97km/h) will be felt widely but exposed coastal areas and higher ground could locally see gusts more than 70mph (113km/h).

Travel disruption and damage is also possible in these areas.

Storm Bram will stengthen as it moves to the west of the UK on Tuesday

As well as strong winds, Bram will also bring heavy rain.

A Met Office amber warning for rain, which came into force from 00:00 GMT on Tuesday and will last until 10:00 GMT, covers a small area of south Wales and south-west England. Around 50-75mm (2-3in) of rain is expected to fall widely in these areas with up to 100mm (3.9in) possible.

After weeks of often heavy rain saturating the ground, further localised flooding and travel disruption is expected. The Met Office has warned that fast flowing or deep floodwater is likely, causing danger to life, and to avoid travelling by road during potentially dangerous road conditions.

Amber rain warnings for parts of Wales and south-west England where impacts are expected to be greater

In addition to the amber warning, there is a yellow Met Office warning for rain that covers a larger area of Wales and south-west England, which came into force at 18:00 GMT on Monday and is in place until 18:00 GMT on Tuesday.

Between 20-40mm (0.8-1.6in) of rain is expected widely with up to 80mm (3.2in) over Dartmoor and the higher ground of Wales.

The Met Office suggests there is a small chance of up to 100mm (3.9in) on the more exposed and prone hills.

More yellow weather warnings for rain will cover north-west England until 15:00 GMT on Tuesday and central Scotland from 06:00 GMT to 12:00 GMT on Tuesday, where a lot of rain could fall over a short period of time.

Up to 80mm (3.2in) is expected over the Cumbrian hills in particular which could lead to some flooding.

The main area of rain will clear away to the north-east during Tuesday but rain and strong winds are likely to continue especially across Scotland into Wednesday.

Over the last few months the UK has seen Storm Benjamin and Claudia, which were named by France and Spain respectively.

So far we have only experienced one storm named by the UK Met Office and our storm naming group - Storm Amy. That is why we go back to the 'B' name - Bram - on the UK, Ireland and Netherlands storm naming list.

The next storm after Bram would be named Chandra if medium or high impacts are expected.

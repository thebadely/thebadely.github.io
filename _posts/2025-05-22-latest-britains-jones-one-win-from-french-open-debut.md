Britain's Francesca Jones is one win away from the French Open main draw but Dan Evans suffered defeat in the second round of qualifying in Paris.

World number 113 Jones battled back from a set down to defeat Japan's Mai Hontama 2-6 6-3 6-4 and reach the final qualifying round.

The 24-year-old will play Ukrainian Anastasiia Soboleva, ranked 230, on Friday, with the main draw getting under way on Sunday.

Evans, attempting to earn an eighth appearance at Roland Garros, lost to 311th-ranked Frenchman Clement Tabur 6-1 6-3.

Katie Boulter, Emma Raducanu, Sonay Kartal and Jodie Burrage are already in the women's draw, while Jack Draper, Jacob Fearnley and Cameron Norrie will contest the men's.

Jones was visibly delighted after coming through her second qualifying match in a demanding two hours and 17 minutes.

After Hontama ran away with the opening set, the players exchanged six consecutive breaks of serve at the start of the second before Jones took charge.

A run of four consecutive games ensured she would take the match the distance, but the tension only increased as the decider began with another five breaks of serve.

Crucially, as in the second set, Jones was first to dig in on serve, providing a springboard to victory as she eventually seized her third match point.

The Briton roared with delight before turning to embrace her supporters in the crowd.

Also through to the final round of qualifying in the men's event is former US Open champion Marin Cilic. 

The 36-year-old Croat, a French Open semi-finalist in 2022, beat Spain's Pol Martin Tiffon 6-4 6-3 to set up a meeting with South African Lloyd Harris.

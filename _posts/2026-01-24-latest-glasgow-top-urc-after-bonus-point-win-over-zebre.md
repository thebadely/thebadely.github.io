Glasgow Warriors moved to the top of the URC table after a hard-fought bonus-point victory over Zebre in Parma.

Franco Smith's side went in front through a penalty try after an ominous rolling maul was stopped illegally and their forward pack continued to dominate in wintery conditions.

Gregor Hiddleston - having been left out of Scotland's Six Nations squad - benefitted twice from lineout mauls to give the Warriors a 14-point half-time lead.

Franco Carrera's try was the hosts' only score in the opening period, but Zebre fought back after the break and narrowed the deficit as Giulio Bertaccini went under the posts.

In what was a scrappy contest, both sides played periods without their full contingent because of yellow cards, but Glasgow restored their cushion when Adam Hastings returned from the sin-bin to score the bonus-point try in the corner.

Zebre full-back Lorenzo Pani intercepted a loose Hastings pass to ensure a nervy finish, but Glasgow managed the remainder of the game expertly for their eighth straight victory in all competitions.

They lead the league table by three points from South African side Stormers, having played a game more.

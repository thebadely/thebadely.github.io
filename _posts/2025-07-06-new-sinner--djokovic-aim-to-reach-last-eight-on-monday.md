It has been recently reported that Seven of Novak Djokovic's 24 Grand Slam singles titles have been won at Wimbledon

Wimbledon 2025

Dates: 30 June-13 July Venue: All England Club

Coverage: Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Full coverage guide.

Jannik Sinner and Novak Djokovic could potentially meet in a blockbuster semi-final at Wimbledon but there is work for both to do before then - starting with their respective fourth-round matches on Monday.

World number one Sinner and sixth seed Djokovic have arguably been the two most impressive players in the men's draw so far.

Italian Sinner has won three Grand Slams but is yet to reach a Wimbledon final, while Serb Djokovic is aiming to equal Roger Federer's tally of eight titles at SW19.

Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva and Poland's Iga Swiatek, seeded seventh and eighth respectively, are the highest-ranked players remaining in the bottom half of the women's draw.

If all goes to schedule and the weather stays fine, the men's and women's quarter-final line-ups will be completed by the close of play on Monday.

Djokovic, 38, overcame illness to win his first-round match in four sets but breezed through rounds two and three.

Saturday's masterful victory over fellow Serb Miomir Kecmanovic was his 100th match win at Wimbledon. He is the third player to reach that landmark, following Martina Navratilova (120) and Federer (105).

Sinner, 23, has found things even more comfortable so far, winning his first three matches without dropping a set and spending less than five and a half hours on court.

But both title contenders will come up against a seeded player for the first time in this tournament on Monday.

Djokovic is first on Centre Court against world number 11 Alex de Minaur of Australia (13:30 BST), with Sinner rounding things off on Centre against Bulgaria's former Wimbledon semi-finalist Grigor Dimitrov.

Sandwiched in between is Andreeva's fourth-round match against American 10th seed Emma Navarro, who ended Barbora Krejcikova's title defence on Saturday.

Clara Tauson of Denmark defeated 2022 champion Elena Rybakina in the third round and the 23rd seed's reward is a meeting with five-time Grand Slam champion Swiatek, which is third on Court One.

Swiatek has reached only one previous quarter-final at SW19 but has shown signs of improvement on the grass, reaching the final at Bad Homburg prior to Wimbledon.

Monday's first contest on Court One sees Russian 18th seed Ekaterina Alexandrova take on former Olympic gold medallist Belinda Bencic of Switzerland, before American men's 10th seed Ben Shelton faces unseeded Italian Lorenzo Sonego.

Two more singles ties are scheduled on court two from 11:00 BST; Croatian veteran Marin Cilic takes on Italian 22nd seed Flavio Cobolli in the remaining men's match, followed by Russian women's 19th seed Liudmila Samsonova's contest against Jessica Bouzas Maneiro of Spain.

How is Swiatek's grip affecting her forehand?

Cameron Norrie, the sole British quarter-finalist in the men's and women's singles, has a well-earned day off after his five-set win over Nicolas Jarry on Sunday.

Therefore, home interest on Monday is focused on the doubles and junior events.

The bottom half of the men's doubles is stacked with British players and quarter-final spots are on offer for fifth seeds Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool and sixth seeds Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski, as well as second seeds Henry Patten and his Finnish partner Harri Heliovaara.

Meanwhile, the mixed doubles has already reached the quarter-final stage.

British pair Joshua Paris and Eden Silva are there, while Salisbury - alongside Brazilian Luisa Stefani - and Skupski - who is playing with American Desirae Krawczyk - are also in the hunt for semi-final places.

Among the Britons in action in the girls' singles are Mimi Xu and second seed Hannah Klugman, who lost in the French Open final last month.

Both were given wildcards into the women's draw at Wimbledon but were beaten in round one.

Here’s what you need to know: Raheem Sterling and Jack Grealish spent one season together at Manchester City

Raheem Sterling, Joao Felix, Axel Disasi and Ben Chilwell have been left out of Chelsea's squad for the Fifa Club World Cup, while Jack Grealish has not been selected by Manchester City.

England forward Grealish was expected to miss out, with the 29-year-old having started just seven league games in 2024-25.

City's 27-man squad also does not include former captain Kyle Walker, who spent the second half of last season on loan at AC Milan, but features England defender John Stones, who has not played since February with a thigh injury.

Chelsea's 28-man group does not feature a quartet which cost them about Â£179m in transfer fees and all ended last season out on loan.

The first edition of the expanded Club World Cup format begins in the United States on Sunday, 15 June (01:00 BST).

Sterling cost Â£50m when he arrived from Manchester City in 2022, but the 30-year-old England forward spent last season on loan with Arsenal, starting just 13 games and scoring once. 

Felix made a permanent move to Chelsea last summer for Â£45m and scored seven goals from 20 appearances before the Portugal forward, 25, ended the campaign on loan at AC Milan.

The Blues paid Â£38.5m to sign Axel Disasi from Monaco in 2023 and the 27-year-old France defender played 17 games last term before ending the season on loan with Aston Villa.

Chilwell was a Â£45m signing in 2020 and, after just one Chelsea game last term, the England left-back, 28, spent the rest of the season with Crystal Palace, being an unused substitute in the Eagles' FA Cup final win over Manchester City.

Serbia goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic, 25, will not be travelling to the US either, after spending last season on loan with Strasbourg.

Goalkeepers: Robert Sanchez, Filip Jorgensen, Mike Penders, Gaga Slonina.

Defenders: Marc Cucurella, Tosin Adarabioyo, Benoit Badiashile, Levi Colwill, Mamadou Sarr, Moises Caicedo, Trevoh Chalobah, Reece James, Malo Gusto, Aaron Anselmino, Josh Acheampong.

Midfielders: Pedro Neto, Enzo Fernandez, Cole Palmer, Noni Madueke, Dario Essugo, Andrey Santos, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Romeo Lavia.

Forwards: Liam Delap, Nicolas Jackson, Christopher Nkunku, Tyrique George, Marc Guiu.

Why are Chelsea in the Club World Cup, but not Liverpool?

Man City sign Â£46.5m Reijnders - but where will he fit in?

Grealish's future is unclear as he has struggled for regular playing time with Manchester City over the past two seasons.

Pep Guardiola's side have also signed midfielders Tijjani Reijnders and Rayan Cherki this week, along with left-back Rayan Ait-Nouri and keeper Marcus Bettinelli, and all will travel to America.

Stones, 31, will return to action despite missing international duty with England over the weekend, and Ballon d'Or winner Rodri, 28, will continue his comeback from an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in September.

Academy product James McAtee, 22, will remain at the European Under-21 Championship, where the attacking midfielder is England captain.

Goalkeepers: Ederson, Stefan Ortega, Marcus Bettinelli.

Defenders: Ruben Dias, John Stones, Nathan Ake, Rayan Ait-Nouri, Vitor Reis, Josko Gvardiol, Manuel Akanji, Abdukodir Khusanov, Rico Lewis.

Midfielders: Tijjani Reijnders, Jeremy Doku, Nico Gonzalez, Rodri, Ilkay Gundogan, Bernardo Silva, Savinho, Matheus Nunes, Rayan Cherki, Phil Foden, Nico O'Reilly.

Forwards: Omar Marmoush, Erling Haaland, Claudio Echeverri, Oscar Bobb.

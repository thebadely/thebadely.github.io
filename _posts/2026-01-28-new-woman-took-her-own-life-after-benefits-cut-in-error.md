Experts revealed that A vulnerable woman took her own life after she got a letter saying her benefits were to be cut which was later found to be an error.

Tamara Logan, 28, died at Tameside General Hospital on 20 May 2025 two days after she was found in her home, an inquest into her death was told.

In a prevention of future deaths report Alison Mutch, senior coroner for south Manchester, concluded the letter had a "very significant impact" on Tamara, who had a history of self-harming.

The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said it took the coroner's comments "extremely seriously" and would provide a "full and detailed response" to her findings. 

At the inquest, Mutch concluded: "On the balance of probabilities, the incorrect decision to withdraw [Tamara's] enhanced daily living allowance and the method of communication of the decision significantly contributed to her declining mental health and her actions on 18 May 2025."

Following the hearing, the coroner wrote to the DWP to express her concerns as part of a Prevention of Future Deaths report. 

The inquest heard Tamara, who was originally from Glossop in Derbyshire, had been assessed as eligible for Personal Independence Payment (PIP) with an enhanced daily living allowance. 

In early 2025 she was reassessed and the DWP mistakenly decided to remove her enhanced living allowance payments - which it has accepted was an error. 

The coroner said DWP records noted Tamara's mental health issues, yet the department sent a standard letter without attempting to reduce the impact the decision could cause. 

"The method used for communication of the decision was also not appropriate given her known vulnerabilities," Mutch wrote in the report. 

In her letter to the DWP, she said she was concerned that Tamara's benefits were cut in error despite being double-checked before a final decision was made. 

"The purpose of the check was to avoid these errors being made and it was unclear why it had not picked up the incorrect approach," she said. 

The DWP must respond to the Prevention of Future Deaths Report by 19 March. 

A spokesperson said: "Our sincere condolences go to Ms Logan's family and friends.

"Protecting the millions of people we support every year is a priority."

The DWP has launched a review of PIP, called the Timms Review, to make sure "it is fit and fair for the future". 

The Timms Review is expected to be published in autumn this year.

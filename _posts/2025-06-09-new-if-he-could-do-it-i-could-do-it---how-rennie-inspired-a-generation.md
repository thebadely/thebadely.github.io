Amateur referee and author of Your Show on Rennie, Ashley Hickson-Lovence, says Uriah Rennie was an inspiration and a "selfless figure who put the community first" after he passed away aged 65. 

Rennie was the Premier League's first black referee and officiated more than 300 games between 1997 and 2008, including 175 Premier League matches.

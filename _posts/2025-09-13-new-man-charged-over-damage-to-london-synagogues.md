It has been recently reported that A man has been charged in connection with a series of attacks on synagogues in north-west London.

Ionut-Cristian Bold, 37, of no fixed address, has been charged with six counts of racially or religiously aggravated criminal damage as well as one count of racially or religiously aggravated harassment without violence.

Between 4 and 11 September, four synagogues and a private residence in Golders Green had a substance smeared on them, the Met Police has said.

Other incidents, which police described as "revolting and appalling", involved liquid being thrown towards a school and over a car. It is understood the substance and liquid were bodily fluids.

Mr Bold has also been charged with three counts of destroying or damaging property as well as one count of having an article with intent to destroy or damage property.

He has been remanded to appear at Willesden Magistrates' Court on Monday.

Supt Zubin Writer, who leads local policing in Barnet, Brent and Harrow, said: "We will always treat allegations of this nature extremely seriously and these charges follow an investigation by a team of local officers.

"We continue to offer support to local residents, including members of the Jewish community."

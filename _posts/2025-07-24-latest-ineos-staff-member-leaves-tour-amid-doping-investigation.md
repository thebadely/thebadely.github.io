Let's dive into the details: Bradley Wiggins won the Tour de France with Ineos Grenadiers, then Team Sky, in 2012

An Ineos Grenadiers staff member has left the Tour de France after being asked to speak to the International Testing Agency about doping allegations relating to the 2012 season.

David Rozman is one of the team's soigneurs, a role which involves working as an assistant to riders and providing a range of services from logistics to massages.

Ineos Grenadiers, then known as Team Sky, won the 2012 Tour de France, with Britain's Bradley Wiggins claiming the yellow jersey, and the team went on to win six of the next seven editions of the race.

Ineos Grenadiers confirmed Rozman has received an interview request, external from the ITA after initially being contacted in April. 

"Following recent media allegations, David [Rozman] has now received a request from the ITA to attend an interview," Ineos Grenadiers said.

"Accordingly, he has stepped back from race duties and has left the Tour.

"Rozman was informally contacted in April 2025 by a member of ITA staff, who asked him about alleged historical communications. 

"Although the ITA assured David at the time that he was not under investigation, Ineos promptly commissioned a thorough review by an external law firm.

"The team has acted responsibly and with due process, taking the allegations seriously whilst acknowledging that David is a long-standing, dedicated member of the team. 

"The team continues to assess the circumstances and any relevant developments, and has formally requested any relevant information from the ITA. To date the team has received no evidence from any relevant authority. 

"Both David and the team will of course co-operate with the ITA and any other authority."

Earlier in July, the Irish Independent reported that in 2012, Rozman had exchanged messages with convicted German doping doctor Mark Schmidt. 

A documentary by German TV company ARD also linked Ineos to Schmidt but did not name the staff member involved.

In 2021, Schmidt was sentenced to four years and 10 months in jail after being convicted of administering illegal blood transfusions to athletes within cycling and a number of other sports as part of Operation Aderlass.

When contacted by BBC Sport, the ITA said its investigations are "conducted confidentially" and "outcomes may only be shared if and when it yields the pursuit of one or more anti-doping rule violations."

BBC Sport has also contacted Ineos Grenadiers for comment.

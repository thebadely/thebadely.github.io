GB women win floor silver and bronze at Gymnastic Championships

Former world champion Beth Tweddle hailed the progression of British gymnastics as three medals were won on the final day of the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Jakarta, Indonesia.

Joe Fraser became the first British gymnast to win a medal in the high bar, finishing third, while the team continued their excellence on the floor with silver for Ruby Evans and bronze for Abigail Martin. 

Evans also became the first Welsh gymnast to win an individual medal at the World Championships.

It capped a remarkable 24 hours for the British team after Jake Jarman and Luke Whitehouse secured a British one-two in the men's floor final on Friday.

The haul made Britain the leading nation in the world in the floor discipline and Tweddle, who won Britain's first women's world floor title in 2009, told BBC Sport: "It's just incredible to see the journey that British gymnastics as a whole has been on. 

"Coming from where we were 20 years ago to now - four out of the six floor medals at this championships have come home to Great Britain."

Britain's return of five medals across the championships has only ever been bettered by their six-medal haul in Liverpool in 2022, when Jessica Gadirova became Britain's second women's world floor champion.

Dave Hart, British Gymnastics performance director, put this year's success down to a dedicated programme which sees coaches working closely with local clubs.

"It's been an incredible summation of a community's hard work," he said.

"We've got a world-class programme connected to our clubs. Seeing our coaching community come together and work with our gymnasts to deliver what we saw out there over the last few days is just outstanding."

Evans, 18, finished runner-up behind Japan's Aiko Sugihara with a score of 13.666, while Martin came third in her first World Championships.

The 17-year-old's mark of 13.466 was the same as Romanian gymnast Sabrina Maneca-Voinea, but she was awarded bronze because her execution score was higher.

Fraser, 26, became the first British gymnast to be crowned world champion in the parallel bars in 2019 and this time clinched a historic first bronze in the high bar. 

His score of 14.700 saw him finish behind American Brody Malone, who won gold, and Japan's Daiki Hashimoto.

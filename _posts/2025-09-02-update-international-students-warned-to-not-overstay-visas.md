Let's dive into the details: Tens of thousands of foreign students are being contacted directly by the government and told they will be removed from the UK if they overstay their visas.

The Home Office launched the new government campaign in response to what it has called an "alarming" spike in the number of international students arriving legally on student visas then claiming asylum when they expire.

As part of the campaign, the Home Office has for the first time proactively contacted international students directly by text and email.

Under the plans, about 130,000 students and their families in total will be sent a message telling them: "If you have no legal right to remain in the UK, you must leave.

"If you don't, we will remove you."

Ten thousand international students whose visas are due to expire have already been contacted directly by text and email - warning them they could be deported.

Tens of thousands more will receive the message in the coming months, the BBC understands, to coincide with autumn when applications often increase.

The full message will read: "If you submit an asylum claim that lacks merit, it will be swiftly and robustly refused. 

"Any request for asylum support will be assessed against destitution criteria. If you do not meet the criteria, you will not receive support. 

"If you have no legal right to remain in the UK, you must leave. 

"If you don't, we will remove you."

While the political focus this summer has been on people arriving on small boats, a similar number arrive legally with visas, then apply for asylum often when those visas run out.

Many of these claims are legitimate, but ministers are worried that too many international students are seeking asylum simply to stay in the country because their leave to remain has run out.

In the year to June 2025, 43,600 people seeking asylum arrived on a small boat - 39% of all asylum claims, according to Home Office data.

Another 41,100 asylum claims came from people who entered legally with a visa, the department said, with the largest group among visa holders being students.

Last year, 16,000 asylum claims came from those who arrived on student visas, nearly six times as many as in 2020, it said.

Since then, Home Office data shows there has been a drop of 10%, but ministers in the department want the figures to fall further.

The number of people on skilled worker visas being granted asylum has also fallen, according to the department.

Earlier this year, the Home Office announced a cut in the amount of time overseas graduates can stay in the UK after their studies â€“ from two years to 18 months.

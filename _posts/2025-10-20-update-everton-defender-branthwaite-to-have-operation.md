It has been recently reported that Jarrad Branthwaite made 30 appearances in the Premier League last season

Everton defender Jarrad Branthwaite needs a hamstring operation and is set for an extended spell on the sidelines.

The 23-year-old has yet to feature for David Moyes' side this season after sustaining an injury in pre-season.

The injury was described as a 'minor niggle' in July, but the England international has had a setback and now needs surgery.

Everton said, external: "Following specialist consultation, it has been determined the defender will undergo a surgical procedure to address the issue.

"Branthwaite will commence a structured rehabilitation programme under the supervision of the club's medical team following the operation."

Branthwaite attracted interest from a number of clubs in the summer - including Chelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham - before signing a new five-year contract.

The former Carlisle United defender's career at Everton has included spells on loan at Blackburn Rovers and PSV Eindhoven, where he won the Dutch Cup in the 2022-23 season.

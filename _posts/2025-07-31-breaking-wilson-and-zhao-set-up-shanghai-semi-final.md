Experts revealed that Zhao Xintong had only won two career titles before winning the World Championship in May

World champion Zhao Xintong and world number two Kyren Wilson will meet in the semi-finals of the Shanghai Masters after eliminating Ding Junhui and Ronnie O'Sullivan respectively.

Wilson, the 2024 world champion, surged to a 6-3 win over seven-time Crucible winner O'Sullivan, his third consecutive win against him.

Wilson, who won the first of his 10 career titles in Shanghai in 2015, said: "This event changed my life 10 years ago. I didn't know where I was going and [I was] down in the 50s and 60s in the rankings."

Zhao, playing on the tour for the first time since winning the World Championship in May, eased to a 6-1 victory against compatriot Ding Junhui.

The Chinese player recorded breaks of 134, 132 and 118 as he secured victory in under 90 minutes.

The other semi-final will be contested by English pair Mark Selby and Ali Carter.

Four-time world champion Selby saw off world number one Judd Trump 6-4, recording a top score of 137.

Carter had to overcome a 2-5 deficit for the second match in a row, as he won the deciding frame to defeat Wuhan Open champion Xiao Guodong 6-5.

Selby and Carter will meet on Friday, 1 August, before Wilson and Zhao go head to head on Saturday, 2 August.

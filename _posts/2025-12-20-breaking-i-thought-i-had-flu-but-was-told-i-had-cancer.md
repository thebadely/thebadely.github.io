It has been recently reported that A student who thought she had flu has described being "shell-shocked" when she was told she had cancer.

Sophie Claxton, from Burnley, Lancashire, was 16 and in her first year at college when her mother took her to a GP after her temperature rocketed and she struggled to get out of bed.

She ended up going to an A&E unit for tests and was then quickly transferred to the Christie hospital in Manchester, where a bone marrow biopsy led to her being diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia followed by chemotherapy treatment.

Now 19, and having rung the "all-clear" from cancer bell in March, she says she is "coming out of the other side" and "loving life" at Manchester Metropolitan University.

The criminology student thought she had flu in her first year at college - but when her temperature soared, the GP suspected she might have sepsis. 

She was already so poorly when she received her diagnosis at the Christie, she ended up in the critical care unit on the first night and was given chemotherapy straight away.

After seven weeks of intensive treatment in 2022, she was able to return home for Christmas - by which time she weighed 6st 1lb (39kg) and said she was devastated to lose her hair due to the treatment.

Ms Claxton regularly needed blood and platelet transfusions and ended up in the intensive care ward four times.

She also had to miss a year of college.

However, she is now looking forward to a bright future having moved into the "maintenance" phase of treatment in summer 2023 and completing chemotherapy earlier this year - ringing the end-of-treatment bell in March.

Throughout treatment, Sophie's beloved dog Bonnie was by her side whenever she was at home.

The former Shuttleworth College pupil will need to continue regular check-ups and, when she turns 20, she will be able to have an egg count to see if treatment has impacted her fertility. 

As she was already so poorly when treatment began, there was no time to harvest and freeze her eggs.

Ms Claxton said: "I still struggle to process what has happened to me over the past three years. 

"It was such a huge shock being told I had cancer. I could hardly take in the news as I was only 16. But I'm coming through the other side now and already loving life at uni."

Her mother, Michelle Bebb, nominated Ms Claxton for one of Cancer Research UK's national Star Awards when she was initially diagnosed.

Ms Claxton's two younger sisters also received a certificate, too, for their courage and support during her treatment.

Ms Bebb said: "We were devastated to be told Sophie was so poorly. It was hard on us, her sisters included.

"At the time, we just had to get through it the best we could in the eye of the storm. But, in some ways, I now worry more about her and every time she has a cough or cold, I feel very anxious.

"But we're incredibly proud of her determination and the fact she has just kept going no matter what."

The Star Award is backed by a host of famous faces, including children's poet and author Joseph Coelho, US singer, dancer and reality TV star JoJo Siwa, pop icon Pixie Lott, TV personality Dr Ranj and children's TV favourite Mister Maker.

Every child nominated for the Star Award receives the accolade because the charity believes every child diagnosed with cancer deserves special recognition.

Cancer Research UK's Jane Bullock, said: "We're committed to driving forward progress to ensure more children and young people can live longer, better lives, free from the fear of cancer. 

"After everything Sophie went through, it was an absolute privilege to celebrate her incredible courage with a Star Award.

"A cancer diagnosis is heartbreaking at any age, but it can be particularly difficult for youngsters - especially when many may experience life-long side effects from their treatment."

She added the awards were "a wonderful way to give these extraordinary children and young people the special recognition they truly deserve".

Let's dive into the details: Sergio Aguiar (left) and David Stancombe both ran the 2025 London Marathon 

Sergio Aguiar and David Stancombe, the fathers of two of the young girls killed in Southport last year, were presented with the Helen Rollason Award at BBC Sports Personality of the Year 2025. 

Elsie Dot Stancombe, Alice da Silva Aguiar and Bebe King died at a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop in July 2024.

Since that day, the three families have set out to establish lasting legacies in their daughters' names through the projects Elsie's Story, Alice's WonderDance and Bebe's Hive. 

Alice's father Sergio and Elsie's dad David ran the 2025 London Marathon.

Sergio raised funds to build a new playground at Churchtown Primary School, where Alice and Bebe were pupils, while David ran for Elsie's Story.

They were presented with their award by former Liverpool striker Robbie Fowler and comedian John Bishop.

"I'm very grateful to accept the award tonight but I'm just a dad keeping a promise to his little girl," David said.

"Elsie wanted me to run the London Marathon and I did. It gave me a massive focus through the hardest time I've ever lived through."

Sergio added: "I want to dedicate this award to our three girls: Alice, Elsie and Bebe. Keep dancing.

"I want to spread Alice's magic across the world. I am going to keep running and raising money for her foundation."

The Helen Rollason Award recognises outstanding achievement in the face of adversity.

It was introduced to Sports Personality of the Year in 1999 in memory of the BBC Sport journalist and presenter, who died of cancer that year aged 43.

Being together brings us closer to our girls, say Southport families

'Our daughters will be with us,' say dads of Southport victims running London Marathon

A small team of journalists from BBC Breakfast followed the families of the Southport victims throughout 2025 for the Our Girls: The Southport Families documentary.

The documentary, available on iPlayer, focuses on the joy the girls brought to the families and the legacies their parents have built in their memory. 

The families did not know each other before the tragedy but have grown close since. 

"There's two families in the world that know how we feel. It's them," said Jenni Stancombe, Elsie's mother. 

Her husband David said Elsie had encouraged him to run the marathon.

"We were sat in this living room watching [the London Marathon] and I'd not long lost my mum the year before," said David.

"Elsie was really keen on fundraising. She wanted me to run it for Queenscourt Hospice because that's who looked after my mum. I was like 'yeah, yeah maybe babe'. Who wants to run 26.2 miles? It's not something you just get up and do. 

"It was looking like I'd run the London Marathon for Queenscourt. But yeah, that didn't happen. I ended up running it for Elsie."

The legacy projects established for each of the girls include Alice's WonderDance, made by the Aguiars to support young performers with uniforms, classes and transport.

The Stancombes have created Elsie's Story, a charitable trust that makes grants to assist young people and support others in the Southport area.

One of the projects they have helped fund is Bebe's Hive, a creative centre set up by the Kings that offers support to grieving children.

Earlier this year, the families helped secure funding for a Â£10m revamp of Southport's Town Hall.

The plans, inspired by the girls' love of dance, music and arts, will act as a "thank you" to the people of Southport for their support in the aftermath of the tragedy.

The families hope the space in the heart of the town centre "will become a legacy inspired by our three beautiful and amazing girls". 

"It will be a place of joy, hope and community. A vibrant place where children and families can feel safe, connected and celebrated in the heart of our town," the families said.

Former champion boxer Dr Mark Prince won the award in 2024 for his work with the Kiyan Price Foundation, which keeps young people away from knife crime through boxing.

Previous recipients include rugby league legend Rob Burrow, Scotland rugby union great Doddie Weir, Hillsborough campaigner Anne Williams, football fan Bradley Lowery and racing driver Billy Monger.

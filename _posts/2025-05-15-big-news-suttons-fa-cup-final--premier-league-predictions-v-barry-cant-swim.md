Let's dive into the details: The 144th FA Cup final takes place at Wembley on Saturday - will Manchester City get their hands on the famous old trophy for the eighth time, or can Crystal Palace secure the first major silverware in their 120-year history?

"I would love nothing more than for Palace to win it," said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton. 

"I've got nothing against City, but Palace have never won anything and winning the FA Cup would be huge for their fans. 

"Palace won the Zenith Data Systems Cup in 1991, but you don't get an open-top bus parade for doing that. If they beat City I'd think about going down to south London to applaud them myself."

As well as the FA Cup, Sutton is making predictions for every Premier League game this season against a variety of guests.

For all of this weekend's games in both competitions, he takes on Barry Can't Swim, aka DJ and producer Joshua Mannie, who is an Everton fan.

Barry Can't Swim's latest track, Kimpton (with O'Flynn), is out now, and his new album, Loner, is released in July. 

He is performing at Radio 1's Big Weekend 2025, which takes place from 23 to 25 May in Sefton Park, Liverpool.

Do you agree with their predictions? You can make your own choices below.

The most popular scoreline selected for each Premier League game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.

A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.

Barry Can't Swim's debut album, When Will We Land?, reached number 12 in the UK charts. It was nominated for the 2024 Mercury Prize, and won the BBC Radio 1 Dance Award for best album of the year

Sunday is a momentous day for all Everton fans, with the men's team playing their final game at Goodison Park.

The club move to their new ground at Bramley-Moore Dock for next season and Josh told BBC Sport: "I'm really excited - it's long overdue! - but it's definitely sad at the same time. 

"It will probably take a bit of adjusting to, but overall the positives definitely outweigh the negatives. My uncle was at the new stadium a couple weeks ago and apparently it's amazing."

After several seasons mostly spent fighting relegation, for a while it was uncertain whether Everton would be a Premier League club when they moved to their new home but Josh feels the future is bright on the pitch now too.

"I can't remember the last time I was feeling this optimistic," he added. "There's a real opportunity for a complete rebuild and have a fresh start with so many players out of contract. 

"I'll be honest I was a bit indifferent when Moyes was hired in January but he's done such a brilliant job. I can't think of anyone I'd rather lead us into the new stadium."

Chris Sutton and Josh Mannie / Barry Can't Swim were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.

There is no replay in the FA Cup final. The game will be decided by extra time and penalties.

It hasn't been the season that Manchester City wanted but their bid for a top-five finish is still in their own hands, despite their slip-up against Southampton last week, and they will see it as being important that they end up with a trophy.

Most clubs would be absolutely delighted with that, including Palace, but for Pep Guardiola and for City, it won't be good enough.

I just have a feeling this is going to be a classic FA Cup final - I really hope so, anyway.

We know Palace can cause City problems from their trip to Etihad Stadium a few weeks ago. 

City won 5-2 in the end but I don't think that scoreline really reflects what a close contest it was - Palace went 2-0 up and only a marginal offside call stopped them from leading 3-0 before Pep's side fought back.

That will give Palace plenty of confidence, even though City will be favourites and have got lots more experience of a big occasion.

So, this will be close. I am going to go with my heart over my head and say that, this time, Palace will win.

Sutton's prediction: 3-2

Barry Can't Swim's prediction: I'm going to go with Palace here, mainly because that's what I want to believe. I feel like they're a bit of a bogey team for City, plus they look good right now and I've got a bit of a soft spot for them. 2-1

Villa Park, 19:30 BST

Let's face it, everyone on the planet thinks Aston Villa will win this - the same way everyone will expect Chelsea to beat Manchester United in Friday's other game.

The way both Tottenham and United are approaching next week's Europa League final, they are just gripped with fear. It has become like a World Cup final for both clubs.

Both managers will make lots of changes for their matches on Friday, because they are so afraid of injuries to key players but I just don't think that is the way to approach Wednesday's game in Bilbao. 

Compare it to Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner, who has been playing his strongest team in the run-up to Saturday's FA Cup final.

Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou does not want anyone to get injured but the flip side to leaving key people out is that you want to go into a big game with a bit of momentum, and Tottenham do not have any.

I put myself in a position of a Spurs player, and if I am Micky van de Ven or Cristian Romero, I would want to play against Villa and I would want to take that risk.

But what Postecoglou is scared of, naturally, is if something happens to one of them, because then he would be asked 'why on earth did you do that?'

So, we know what he will do and, because of that, you can't make a case for Tottenham beating Villa, or getting anything at all from this game.

On the face of it, things have turned out pretty well for Villa haven't they? Last summer they would have looked at their last two games of the season - Spurs at home on Friday and United away next weekend - and thought that is very tough.

Now, though, they must be rubbing their hands. They are fighting for a top-five finish and they finish up with two games against teams whose focus this week is completely on an all together different prize.

Sutton's prediction: 2-0

Barry Can't Swim's prediction: I'm guessing Tottenham will be resting their team for the Europa League final and Villa are still aiming for Champions League football. 3-0

Stamford Bridge, 20:15 BST

Like Villa with Tottenham, Chelsea could not have picked a better time to play Manchester United. This is a great opportunity for them in their bid for a top-five finish.

Chelsea are without suspended striker Nicolas Jackson after his red card against Newcastle, which ended their hopes of getting anything at St James' Park.

I am not sure who will play up front on Friday instead of Jackson, or who will get their goals, but I still fully expect Enzo Maresca's side to win.

Manchester United have still been fielding strong teams despite all the changes they have been making around their Europa League ties, but you would not think it from their performances or results.

It is not as if Ruben Amorim has been putting out his Under-18s in recent weeks but their Premier League form is dismal and I can't see any reason why that will change here.

Sutton's prediction: 1-0

Barry Can't Swim's prediction: This is the same as Villa-Spurs, really. United will be focusing on the Europa League and Chelsea have it all to play for. 2-0

Goodison Park, 12:00 BST

As you all know, it's not often I'm wrong about anything but you may remember me saying in a previous predictions article that I thought I held the record for the fastest senior goal at Goodison Park for my effort after 12.94 seconds for Blackburn in 1995 until Abdoulaye Doucoure scored after 10.18 seconds for Everton against Leicester in February.

It turns out the fastest goal before Doucoure was actually by Bournemouth's Colin Clarke, after 11 seconds in a League Cup tie in 1985, but I still hold the record for the fastest away goal there in a men's league game and no-one is taking that away from me, because I don't think Southampton will score at all on Sunday.

Saints will probably be too exhausted from their celebrations after last week's draw with Manchester City to ruin the party as Everton's men's team play their last game at Goodison after 133 years.

I have not got a problem with the Southampton fans celebrating reaching 12 points and avoiding equalling Derby's record for the worst Premier League points tally because they have had to endure an awful season, but it is absolute amateur hour from their players to react the way they did afterwards.

People will say it was down to emotion but how low is your bar if you see that as an achievement? The team should have thanked the supporters, and cleared off down the tunnel.

Everton got taken apart in the first half by Fulham last time out, but were much better in the second half and went to win 3-1 at Craven Cottage.

It would be typical for them to mess up on their big day, but they won't. I fancy Beto to get a goal, and the Toffees to sign off with a win.

Sutton's prediction: 2-0

Barry Can't Swim's prediction: One big last send off at Goodison Park, Moyesey in the dugout, the noise will be amazing, the players will be up for it. I hope they give it the send off it deserves. 5-0

Barry Can't Swim on Everton's best player this season: It's hard to say, but I'd probably go with Jordan Pickford. He's so consistent and reliable and gives the back-line confidence. 

Also, while he's not our player of the season, I think Beto deserves a lot of credit for the impact he's made since Moyes came in too. He was totally written off but has scored a fair amount of goals.

Who would he sign in the summer? I actually think wing-backs are a priority, and a right winger. Oh, and a forward too. 

We've got a bit more creativity now in midfield but I'd like to see more attacking full-backs like we used to have under Moyes in the past. It's going to be a really exciting summer for us.

London Stadium, 14:15 BST

Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds.

This is a huge game for my boyhood side, Nottingham Forest. 

They need to win to keep their hopes of a top-five finish alive, but my fear is they have already blown it.

I played at the City Ground many times but I think my stint there as a Sky pundit for last weekend's draw with Leicester was the first time I've watched a game there rather than been on the pitch, and it was not enjoyable viewing for us Forest fans.

I thought that game was a must-win for Forest's Champions League hopes, and if they drop more points here they could drop out of contention completely.

I've heard some people say that Forest have bottled it, but I don't agree. They have just run out of steam.

Forest's aim now is to get to next weekend and still be in touch before they host Chelsea in their final game of the season, but whether that happens or not relies on which West Ham team turns up.

The Hammers were on a poor run before they went to Old Trafford last weekend and won. That would usually be an impressive result but it is not much of an achievement at the moment.

I know who I want to win but, for different reasons, it is hard to back either side here.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Barry Can't Swim's prediction: I would really love to see Forest get into the Champions League but they've hit a bit of a dip and it feels like West Ham love a draw at the moment. 1-1

GTech Community Stadium, 15:00 BST

Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra 2 and BBC Sounds.

I am looking at every game this week as the one that could make or break my chances of defending my predictions title but, whatever I say here, I know I'll be wrong because I've found Fulham almost impossible to call all season.

I was actually spot on with my prediction when they beat Brentford 2-1 in November, but only because Harry Wilson scored two injury-time goals.

On form, the Bees are favourites here after winning their past four games, but Fulham have the ability to beat anyone, and they also usually do the opposite of what I think.

Maybe I am best off going with a draw, because the opposite of that is still a draw. 

On top of that, I think everyone else will go for a home win so this could be the result that makes the difference for me - I need it to, because my title is on the line after two successive seasons where I have triumphed.

The guests can steal my crown with another win this week but I'd like everyone to take a look at my points tally [see tables below] as proof of who the predictions king really is.

Sutton's prediction: 2-2

Barry Can't Swim's prediction: Brentford are playing really well just now and will have that extra motivation for a possible European place. 2-1

King Power Stadium, 15:00 BST

Leicester were really good against Nottingham Forest last week once Ruud van Nistelrooy had made some substitutions, but they were terrible before he changed things.

It took a 94th-minute equaliser from Jordan Ayew to deny Ipswich a win when Leicester came to Portman Road in November but that was when both sides were still fighting to stay up, which feels like an awfully long time ago now.

What a desperate game this is for both teams, because the only prize for the winner is 18th place. 

I am backing Leicester to take it, and it would be fitting for Jamie Vardy to mark his final home game for the club with his 200th Foxes goal.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Barry Can't Swim's prediction: Leicester have had a couple of good results recently, I think they'll continue that at home. 2-1

Emirates Stadium, 16:30 BST

Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds.

This is a big game with second place up for grabs, and it is a bit of a grudge match too.

Newcastle have beaten Arsenal three times already this season and their meetings have been quite spiky since the Magpies grabbed a controversial win over Mikel Arteta's side in 2023.

Arsenal will be absolutely desperate to put one over them this time, but I can see this turning into a real battle and I would not be surprised if it ends up in a draw.

That is a better result for the Gunners, because a point would all but guarantee them a Champions League place - their goal difference is much better than the other teams in that race - even if their fans will want more.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Barry Can't Swim's prediction: It's really hard to call this one. Newcastle are more in form but Arsenal are at home. I'll go with a draw. 1-1

Amex Stadium, 20:00 BST

It's so hard to make a prediction for this game because I have no idea what the Liverpool line-up will look like, or what their mindset will be. 

Arne Slot's side will lift the Premier League trophy at Anfield after their final game of the season against Crystal Palace next weekend. Their work is done, and they have got that party to look forward to, so how focused will they be here?

As things stand, Brighton do have something to play for because eighth place will get them in the Europa Conference League, if Manchester City win the FA Cup.

The Seagulls played really well at Wolves last week, and fully deserved their win. 

They gave Liverpool a good game at Anfield earlier in the season, when they led 1-0 at half-time but lost 2-1, and if Slot picks a weakened team then they are good enough to take advantage.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Barry Can't Swim's prediction: Again I am just thinking of Europe for Brighton and Liverpool's season is done, so I'm going with a draw here. 1-1

Sutton got three correct results with no exact scores from the 10 Premier League games in week 36, giving him a total of 30 points.

That was enough to tie with the BBC readers - using the most popular scoreline from your predictions for each game, you also got three correct results, with no exact scores.

But it was Sutton's guests, grime stars Footsie and Strategy, who took the weekly win to move back to the top of the table with only two weeks to go.

Footsie also got three correct results and no exact scores, but Strategy did better than anyone else with five correct results and no exact scores and, combined, gave them an average of 40 points and a potentially vital victory.

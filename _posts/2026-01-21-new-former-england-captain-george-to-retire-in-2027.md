Here’s what you need to know: Jamie George has passed 100 caps for England and more than 300 games for Saracens in his career

Former England captain Jamie George is to retire at the end of 2027 after agreeing a one-year contract extension with Saracens.

George will complete the 2026-27 season for the Prem club before retiring later that year to move into a new career in the "business world", a club statement said.

The 35-year-old has been capped 105 times by England and captained his country during 2024 before acting as vice-captain to Maro Itoje. 

The hooker has also been selected for the British and Irish Lions on three tours and made more than 300 appearances for Saracens, having spent his whole career at the London club.

"I have always been very open and honest and I wanted to continue to do that with regards to my retirement," George said.

"I'm sure it seems early to be announcing this with another season to go, but I want to make sure I soak up every moment of my final season - I am more motivated than ever to finish my career at Saracens in a successful way."

George made his international debut in 2015 and has won three Six Nations titles with England - including a Grand Slam in 2016 - and was also part of the squads that reached the World Cup final in 2019 and semi-final in 2023. 

And with a World Cup in Australia in autumn 2027, George faces the prospect of being able to end his career there if all were to go to plan.

He was capped by the Lions during the tours to New Zealand in 2017 - starting all three Test matches as they drew the series - as well as South Africa in 2021, before being called-up to last summer's squad in Australia as an injury replacement.

At club level, he joined Saracens' academy as a 14-year-old and made his debut in 2009 before becoming a regular in their front row through their era of dominance.

George has gone on to win six Premiership titles and three European Champions Cups, with their most recent trophy the league title in 2023, while he stayed with Sarries when they were relegated to the Championship in 2020 following salary cap breaches.

He made his 300th appearance for the club in January 2025 and has featured seven times so far this campaign.

George will retire a one-club player having spent his whole career with Saracens

George added that it had been an "absolute honour to live out my childhood dreams". 

"I have created so many special memories and I have no doubt that there will be plenty more to come," he said.

Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall - who has worked with George since the start of his career - said he had been "central" to everything the club has done over the years.

"Club legend doesn't even begin to do justice to the extraordinary contribution that Jamie has had at Saracens," McCall said. 

"He has been central to all the good things that have been achieved over the years. Equally, his loyalty to the club, particularly when it was most needed, is something we will never forget.

"Jamie's patience, especially in his early years, his competitive spirit, rugby IQ, talent and inner drive have all led to one of the great careers."

It is difficult to think of a player more universally respected than Jamie George.

It is a reputation partly built on his ability on the pitch.

He emerged on the Test scene in 2015 as a relentless all-court hooker, with mobility, endurance and under-rated pace.

His linebreak to help set up Conor Murray's try and a second-Test victory in Wellington was crucial in the British and Irish Lions' nip-and-tuck drawn Test series with New Zealand in 2017.

Now 35, some of that open-field zip has gone from his game, but his dead-eyed set-piece accuracy and cool head is still highly valued.

Against France in the Six Nations last year, under heavy, late pressure, he nailed a line-out throw to Ollie Chessum from which Elliot Daly went under the sticks for a game-winning try.

However, his ability to add to and lead teams off the pitch has stood apart.

Lions coach Warren Gatland was so impressed by his character, George was a serious contender to captain the 2021 Lions tour â a selection which would have come from left field given the likes of Alun Wyn Jones and Maro Itoje were also in the party.

In 2024, George did finally get the call, with Steve Borthwick asking him to succeed Owen Farrell as England skipper. The question was posed on the same day George learned his mother Jane had been diagnosed with cancer.

George considered turning down the role, but his family convinced him otherwise. His determination to make the set-up more enjoyable, human and meaningful for players was a step change from past regimes that is still paying out.

His time in charge lasted only a year. His Saracens team-mate Maro Itoje took on the role in 2025 and George, clearly frustrated by the demotion, considered ending his Test career.

He didn't. He dealt with the disappointment with magnanimity and played on. A promising and youthful England team will surely have his character and class on board as they aim for a Rugby World Cup in 2027 for his final hurrah.

After six English titles, three European crowns and three Six Nations wins, landing the biggest pot of all would be a fitting conclusion.

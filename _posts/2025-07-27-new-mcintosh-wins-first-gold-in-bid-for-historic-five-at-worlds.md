Let's dive into the details: Summer McIntosh holds world records in the 200 and 400m individual medley events as well as the 400m freestyle

Canada's Summer McIntosh took gold in the women's 400m freestyle event at the World Aquatics Championships in Singapore as American Katie Ledecky finished with the bronze.

The event was seen as a battle between 18-year-old McIntosh - who has three Olympic gold medals - and 28-year-old nine-time Olympic champion Ledecky.

However, McIntosh led from the start to win in three minutes 56 seconds, with China's Li Bingjie second and Ledecky 2.23secs behind the leader.

McIntosh has a chance to join Michael Phelps as the only swimmer to win five individual titles at a single world championships as she is also set to race in the 400m and 200m individual medley, 200m butterfly and 800m freestyle.

Speaking to Canadian broadcaster CBC, the teenager said: "It's amazing, day one is probably my biggest day in the meet.

"That 400m freestyle, I was so in control that entire race and super strong. Overall I felt I had the endurance. I'm just trying to take it one race at a time and day by day."

Ben Proud beat his own British record as he recorded a time of 22.74secs to finish second in his semi-final, behind Switzerland's Noe Ponti, to reach the men's 50m butterfly final.

Britain's Jordan Houlden came fourth in men's 1m springboard diving event, while Noah Penman finished 17th out of 59 divers in the preliminary round on his maiden senior world championships appearance.

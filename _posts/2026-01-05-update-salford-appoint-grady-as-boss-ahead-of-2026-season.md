It has been recently reported that Salford finished bottom of Super League last season as their off-field issues mounted prior to their liquidation in the High Court

Salford RLFC have appointed Mike Grady as their head coach shortly before the start of the 2026 Championship season.

Grady previously worked for the club as head coach of their women's team in 2023 and has also held roles at Widnes Vikings and Rochdale Hornets.

He arrives just 11 days before Salford are set to take to the field to face Oldham in the opening fixture of the season and their first match since they were wound up by the High Court and subsequently revamped under the ownership of a consortium led by former player Mason Caton-Brown in December.

"It's an honour to be given this opportunity to lead Salford RLFC. The professionalism, belief and sense of hope growing under the new ownership has motivated so many of us," Grady said.

"We know this will be a challenging period, but we'll be ready. I want to draw on the club's proud heritage, tough to the core, full of heart and committed to playing entertaining rugby that makes our fans proud."

According to new developments, Delicious Orie was tipped to win a heavyweight world title

Heavyweight Delicious Orie has retired from boxing after a short stint in the professional ranks.

Orie, 27, made his pro debut in April, beating Bosnian Milos Veletic on points, but has now decided to walk away from the sport.

The Russian-born Briton won gold at the 2022 Commonwealth Games and represented Great Britain at the Paris Olympics.

"I have decided to hang up my gloves and retire from boxing to follow up on my degree and enter the corporate world," Orie said on Instagram.

"Over time, I've come to recognise that the same fire and love I once had for boxing has gradually faded.

"As I've grown, I've come to value clarity and honesty with myself above all.

"I hoped that turning professional would reignite the passion, but the truth has become clear: it hasn't."

Alongside boxing, Orie also has a first-class honours degree in Economics and Management from Aston University.

Orie had 39 amateur fights and turned down an offer from the WWE to continue boxing.

He added: "Every fighter knows you need a deep love for the craft to reach the top - and without it, there's no path forward.

"Out of respect for the sport and for myself, it's time to step away with honesty."

He was a hot favourite for the heavyweight gold in Paris, but suffered a shock early exit from the Games.

The Briton, once dubbed the next Anthony Joshua, was tipped to fight for world honours in the coming years.

He signed with promotional outfit Queensberry earlier this year having been pursued by all the major promotional companies in the UK.

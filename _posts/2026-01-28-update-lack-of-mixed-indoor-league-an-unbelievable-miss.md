According to new developments, Nelly Korda has won two major titles in 2021 and 2024

World number two Nelly Korda has called the lack of a mixed gender indoor virtual league "an unbelievable miss" following the launch of a women's competition backed by Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy.

The WTGL will be held in the same Florida venue as the men's TGL, which is currently midway through its second season.

Some of the world's best female golfers will compete in a season of team matchplay in the SoFi Center in Palm Beach Gardens, but Korda suggested not combining the men and women's events was a missed opportunity.

"I have mixed feelings on it, and I'm surprised no other girls have spoken out about it," she said.

"It's a huge and unbelievable miss that we're not playing alongside the men.

"There's no greater way to grow the game, and it would have been revolutionary. It would have been the first time, I think, that men and women are on the same playing field, playing for the same exact amount of money. 

"But I also think it's great that we are getting this opportunity, so that's my mixed feelings."

The indoor golf set-up features teams of players hitting shots at a five-storey-high simulator screen before moving to a short-game area with bunkers and a green that can rotate 360 degrees, creating hole-to-hole variations.

Asked about the prospect of a mixed-gender event, Mike McCarley, a former TV executive who founded the TGL alongside McIlroy and Woods said the idea had been discussed.

"I think that is something that's interesting to us and is interesting to the LPGA and is interesting to a lot of the players we're talking to," said McCarley.

"Right now, we're really focused on building (the TGL) out and providing, frankly, a nice stage and really nice platform to showcase the players and their personalities."

Korda, 27, is yet to commit to entering the event, saying she is "still weighing out the time commitment" required to play in the tournament.

World number one Jeeno Thitikul and British golfers Charley Hull and Lottie Woad are among the players confirmed to compete.

Atlanta Drive beat New York GC 4-3 to win the first  TGL title last year, with a prize pot of Â£10.39m being split between the two finalists.

This season's competition, external began on 28 December, with a best-of-three final set to start on 23 March.

The start date and prize pot for the women's competition is yet to be announced, beyond it being scheduled to take place in winter 2026-27.

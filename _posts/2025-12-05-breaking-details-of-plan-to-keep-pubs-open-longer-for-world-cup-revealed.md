Let's dive into the details: Pubs in England and Wales could stay open until 01:00 next summer if a home nation reaches the quarter-finals or further at the football World Cup.

The government has launched a six-week public consultation on extending pub licensing hours to allow fans to come together and support the teams.

The tournament kicks off next June in the US, Canada and Mexico - which feature time zones at least five hours behind the UK. The consultation proposes a potential extension to licensing hours for the semi-finals and final until 01:00, if matches kick-off at 21:00 or earlier UK time.

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has the legislative power to extend pub opening hours on occasions of "exceptional international, national or local significance".

They were previously extended at last year's Women's 2025 Euro, the Men's 2024 Euro final and Women's Euro 2022 Final.

Pub opening hours were also extended for the 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day in May this year.

This extension would only apply to England and Wales as Scotland and Northern Ireland have separate licensing regimes.

The home secretary said: "Our nation's pubs are going into extra time. If any nation reaches the final stages, we will extend licensing hours."

Next year's tournament will be the first time a World Cup has been hosted by three nations.

England and Scotland will learn their group stage opponents on Friday at the finals draw in Washington DC.

Wales and Northern Ireland also have a chance of reaching the tournament when they compete in the play-offs, where a total of 16 teams will battle it out for four slots at the competition.

Michael Kill, CEO of the Night-Time Industries Association, welcomed the move to allow pubs to stay open later, saying: "We believe this consultation represents a positive step in ensuring that the hospitality industry can contribute fully to the nation's excitement and economic activity during such a landmark event."

Emma McClarkin, CEO of the British Beer and Pub Association, said: "The pub has and always will be the home of live sport and there's no better place to gather under one roof during moments of huge national significance and make memories."

Kate Nicholls, chair of industry group UKHospitality, said: "I'm pleased the government is once again looking at extended licensing hours... it can provide a real boost for hospitality businesses".

The consultation runs until January and a decision by the Home Office will be taken as soon as possible once responses have been reviewed.

Dave Allen weighed in 20lb heavier than Johnny Fisher for their heavyweight rematch on Saturday in London.

The fight occurs five months after Fisher narrowly beat Allen on points in Saudi Arabia.

Allen, 33, is the underdog again but was in top spirits at the weigh-in, sporting his own face on his pants as he weighed in 18st 13lb.

"I am going to get going earlier this time. I've come in heavier. I've come to get the job done inside the distance," Allen said.

Romford's Fisher was 17st 7lb and is aiming to improve his 13-0 perfect record at the Copper Box Arena.

Fisher, 26, was knocked down for the first time in his career in his first fight with Allen, but was given a split decision win on the scorecards.

Speaking to his supporters at the weigh-in, Fisher said: "You are that 12th man on the pitch with me. We're going to get it done. Bosh."

Trainer Jamie Moore and Dave Allen were in good spirits at the weigh-in

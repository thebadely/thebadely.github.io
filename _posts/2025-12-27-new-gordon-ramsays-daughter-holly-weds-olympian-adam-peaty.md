Let's dive into the details: Model Holly Ramsay and Olympic gold-medal-winning swimmer Adam Peaty have got married at Bath Abbey. 

Her TV chef father Gordon Ramsay was by her side as she walked into the historic church for the ceremony on Saturday afternoon, wearing a white silky cloak over her dress, which appeared to feature a long train and some lacy detail.

Holly, 25, and Peaty, 30, were surrounded by photographers and members of the public as they left the church arm-in-arm after the ceremony before getting into a waiting car.

A number of celebrity guests - including members of the Beckham family and Dragons' Den star Sara Davies - attended the wedding.

Holly's two sisters Tilly and Megan were bridesmaids along with Adam's sister Bethany. The bride's mother Tana was also pictured outside the church before the wedding.

Gordon Ramsay, known for his Hell's Kitchen and Kitchen Nightmares shows, wrote on Instagram earlier in the day that he "couldn't be a prouder dad", adding: "I'm truly so lucky being able to walk this beautiful bride down the aisle and gaining an incredible son-in-law."

Peaty reportedly met his fiancee through her sister Tilly while the two were contestants on Strictly Come Dancing in 2021.

Holly Ramsay is an influencer and mental health advocate. In 2021 she launched her "21 & Over" podcast, for "those who struggle with anxiety, self-doubt, mental health and creating identities in today's world".

She is the second-eldest of Gordon and Tana Ramsay's six children.

Peaty, from Staffordshire, who has six Olympics medals to his name, has a five-year-old son from a previous relationship with artist Eirianedd Munro.

Former footballer Sir David Beckham, his wife, fashion designer Lady Beckham, and their youngest children Romeo, Cruz and Harper were among the celebrity guests in attendance.

Lady Beckham, 51, wore a cut-own dark teal gown from her Victoria Beckham Pre Spring/Summer 2026 collection that is worth £1,290.

Dragons' Den star Sara Davies and former MasterChef: The Professionals judge Marcus Wareing - who previously worked under Gordon Ramsay - were also among the guests.

Entrepreneur Davies, 41, was also a contestant on series 19 of the BBC One dancing competition, where the couple reportedly first met.

Holly announced their engagement in September 2024 Instagram post that said: "I am marrying my best friend. I truly cannot put into words how I am feeling right now."

In a separate post, Peaty said: "I can't believe you're going to be my wife. I'm truly the luckiest man on earth to have such a gentle, caring and beautiful woman by my side."

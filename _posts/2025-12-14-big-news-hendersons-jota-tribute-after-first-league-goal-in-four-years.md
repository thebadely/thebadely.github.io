It has been recently reported that Jordan Henderson scored 33 goals in 492 appearances for Liverpool

Brentford midfielder Jordan Henderson paid tribute to former Liverpool team-mate Diogo Jota after scoring in Sunday's draw against Leeds.

The England midfielder played 77 games with Jota, who died in a car crash aged 28 in July, along with his brother Andre Silva.

Henderson recreated Jotaâs trademark celebration at Gtech Community Stadium - sitting down and pretending to play a computer game - to mark his first Premier League goal since December 2021.

That came in a comfortable 4-1 derby win for Liverpool at neighbours Everton when Jota was also on the scoresheet.

"It was his birthday recently," Henderson, 35, told Sky Sports. 

"We will never forget him. We always remember him forever. I can only imagine what the lads at Liverpool are going through. 

"He was a good friend and, like I said, I don't score many goals so I thought I would dedicate it to him."

The former Liverpool captain was in tears when he laid flowers in honour of Portugal international Jota outside Anfield on the day after his death.

On Instagram, Henderson wrote, external "it was a pleasure to share a pitch with you but more importantly a friendship".

The pair both featured in the 2022 FA Cup final when Liverpool beat Chelsea on penalties at Wembley.

Henderson left Liverpool to join Saudi Pro League club Al-Ettifaq in July 2023, before moving to Ajax in January 2024.

He agreed an early termination of his deal with the Dutch club last summer and returned to English football with Brentford.

At 35 years and 180 days, Henderson became Brentford's oldest Premier League scorer when his low shot deflected in off Leeds defender Jaka Bijol to give his side a lead that was later cancelled out by Dominic Calvert-Lewin's header.

"Jordan's experience, knowledge of the game is second to none," Brentford boss Keith Andrews told Sky Sports.

"He has been an impactful player for us. He has settled into life here really well and he has played a big part. Long may it continue."

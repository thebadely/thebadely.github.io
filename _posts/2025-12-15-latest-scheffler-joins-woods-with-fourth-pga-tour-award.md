According to new developments, Scottie Scheffler won six times in 2025 and just needs the US Open to complete a career Grand Slam

Scottie Scheffler has become just the second man after Tiger Woods to win the PGA Tour's player of the year award for four seasons in a row.

The 29-year-old American won six times in 2025, including two majors - The Open and the PGA Championship - and recorded a PGA Tour-best 17 top-10 finishes as well as not missing a single cut.

He is just the second player to claim the Jack Nicklaus Award in at least four straight seasons after Woods (five in succession between 1999 and 2003 - and 11 overall).

World number one Scheffler won the vote of PGA Tour members ahead of his fellow American Ben Griffin, England's Tommy Fleetwood and Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy.

PGA Tour chief executive Brian Rolapp said: "Scottie's consistent level of success has been nothing short of spectacular as he continues to chase history on the PGA Tour, and we're excited to see what he will deliver in 2026."

South Africa's Aldrich Potgieter received the Arnold Palmer Award as the PGA Tour rookie of the year after a season in which he was the only newcomer to qualify for the FedEx Cup Play-offs.

Potgieter, one of five rookies to win on the tour this season, is the third South African winner of the prize, joining Ernie Els (1994) and Trevor Immelman (2006).

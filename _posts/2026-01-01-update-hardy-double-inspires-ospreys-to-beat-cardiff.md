It has been recently reported that Wales scrum-half Kieran Hardy joined Ospreys from Scarlets 

United Rugby Championship

Ospreys (12) 33

Tries: Giles, Hardy 2, Parry, Hopkins Cons: Edwards 4

Cardiff (7) 22

Tries: Adams 2, Faletau, Sebastian Cons: Sheedy

Wales scrum-half Kieran Hardy scored two tries to inspire Ospreys to a New Year's derby bonus-point victory against Cardiff in Bridgend.

Hardy's brace was supplemented by tries from wing Keelan Giles, Iestyn Hopkins and hooker Sam Parry to lift Ospreys to eighth in the United Rugby Championship (URC) table.

Cardiff launched a late fightback with three tries in the final eight minutes to claim a losing bonus point and rise to second in the league behind Stormers.

Wales wing Josh Adams added to his first-half score and replacements Taulupe Faletau and Javan Sebastian also crossed.

Cardiff were hampered by ill-discipline as they were overpowered by the Ospreys forwards and the visitors will be disappointed with a festive derby return of one win in three games.

Ospreys had started the Christmas period rock bottom in the league, but have risen eight places after successive derby wins.

The match was played in front of a Brewery Field sellout of 7,700 supporters. 

Ospreys 'heading in right direction' to keep Edwards

A year to remember and a year to forget for Wales 

Welsh rugby 'on a precipice' after shocking year 

Wales prop Keiron Assiratti returned from a calf injury among five Cardiff changes to the side that narrowly beat the Dragons on Boxing Day.

Fellow prop Danny Southworth, lock George Nott, number eight Alun Lawrence and scrum-half Johan Mulder also started.

Stand-in Ospreys skipper Dewi Lake dropped to the replacement bench, with Parry and full-back Jack Walsh named as co-captains. 

Hardy, who was only the specialist number nine in the Ospreys squad with injuries to Reuben Morgan-Williams and Luke Davies, went close to the opening score, but lost the ball over the line before flanker Harri Deaves was also held up.

Wales wing Giles eventually broke the deadlock with his fine individual try following a clever Hardy pass.

In their first attack of note Cardiff responded with some classy attacking play with centre Ben Thomas gliding through the Ospreys defence twice and providing the try-scoring pass to Adams.

Ospreys returned to the power game with Hardy benefitting by diving over the ruck to score.

Cardiff captain Liam Belcher was shown a yellow card for an illegal clearout on Rhys Davies in an action that visiting flanker Dan Thomas was also involved with, but he avoided being sin-binned.

Ospreys could not take advantage of the extra man and led 12-7 at half-time.

Cardiff were restored to 15 men, but Ospreys scored early in the second half after instrumental work from wing Hopkins and lock Ryan Smith allowing Parry to score.

Ospreys were without Wales prop Gareth Thomas, who is sidelined with a calf injury until the end of January, but Garyn Phillips demonstrated his worth when he popped up with a crucial defensive turnover.

Hardy crossed for the bonus-point score as he left Cardiff wing Mason Grady trailing in his wake before Hopkins completed the Ospreys scoring.

Cardiff responded with a fine second score for Adams before Faletau charged over, with their supporters wondering where this attacking intent had been for the opening 70 minutes.

Ospreys replacement Morgan Morse was shown a yellow card for a professional foul before Sebastian crossed for the losing bonus-point score.

The game between these two sides was taking place at a time when the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) planning to cut a men's professional side.

There are rumours that Ospreys owners, Y11 Sports and Media, are in talks to buy WRU-owned Cardiff, who went into administration briefly before being taken over by Welsh rugby's governing body.

The WRU announced in October it wants to reduce the number of teams to three, with licences to be granted in Cardiff, the west and east.

Negotiations have continued, but the WRU has announced that a decision on how a team will be cut will now not happen before the end of the year.

It had seemed there would be a straight shootout between Scarlets and Ospreys for the west licence before this other proposal - of Y11 taking over Cardiff - emerged, one which would enable Welsh rugby bosses to get to their desired number of three.

The WRU and Y11 have both declined to comment on this possibility, fuelling fears of Ospreys supporters about their sides' future.

Cardiff fans have been vocal on social media against any such proposed takeover deal, hoping another consortium, involving former Cardiff director Martyn Ryan and three Hollywood producers, will be favoured.

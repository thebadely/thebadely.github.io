Here’s what you need to know: The Daily Mail says Scotland Yard "swooped" on Peter Mandelson's two homes, as officers investigate claims of misconduct in a public office. The Daily Mail reports that he was not arrested but he "may face questions from Metropolitan Police detectives in the coming weeks". The Sun opts for "Police rummage through Mandy's drawers" as its headline. According to the Daily Telegraph, the raids in London and Wiltshire were "launched simultaneously yesterday afternoon". The paper says flashbulbs could be seen going off inside Lord Mandelson's home in Camden, suggesting that photographs were being taken.

The Times has been told the former deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, privately warned Sir Keir Starmer that appointing Lord Mandelson as ambassador to the US would be a mistake. The paper reports that the prime minister is said to have ignored her warning and chose to believe Lord Mandelson's claim that he "barely knew" the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

"Deceit, betrayal and a scandal that demands historic change" is the headline accompanying Gordon Brown's article in the Guardian. He describes the sexual trafficking plotted by Epstein as the "most egregious example of a global network of wealthy and powerful men that thinks it can act with impunity".

The Daily Express leads on criticism of the decision to raise the BBC licence fee. Writing in the paper, the shadow culture secretary, Nigel Huddleston, says "asking people to pay more for a service that is losing trust is not credible". The Daily Mirror's TV editor, Nicola Methven, points out the rise is equivalent to another 46p per month. "We'd be lost without Aunty," she says.

The Daily Star bemoans the state of the weather after forecasters revealed rain has fallen somewhere in the UK every day this year. "Things can only get wetter" is the headline.

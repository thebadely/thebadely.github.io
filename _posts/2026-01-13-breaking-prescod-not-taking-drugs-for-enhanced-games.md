Experts revealed that Reece Prescod says he is putting preparation and technique ahead of performance-enhancing substances

Former Great Britain sprinter Reece Prescod says he will not take performance-enhancing drugs despite signing up for the controversial Enhanced Games.

The competition, scheduled to take place in Las Vegas in May, will allow athletes to take substances, under medical supervision, that are banned in mainstream sport.

The 29-year-old, who retired last year, is the fourth-fastest British man over 100m, with a personal best of 9.93 seconds.

Speaking to BBC Radio 4's World at One programme, Prescod replied "no" when questioned on whether he had taken any substances so far.

Asked "But will you?" he again replied: "No."

"Obviously, medical-wise it's always confidential, but I think for me right now the biggest priority is getting back into that sub-10 shape," he added.

The Enhanced Games has been criticised for endangering athletes' health and undermining fair play, with the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) describing it as a "dangerous and irresponsible project".

Only substances approved by the United States' Food and Drug Administration, (FDA) can be taken. That is a different list to the one the Wada allows for elite athletes.

UK Athletics' chief executive Jack Buckner said he was "appalled" when it was revealed Prescod had signed up earlier in January.

Prescod said participants - who also include former British Olympic swimmer Ben Proud - had a "personal choice" over what measures they adopt.

Speaking in September, Proud said organisers "aren't asking me to take anything" and added he was unsure if he would use any substances.

"People aren't necessarily aware that's actually a choice you have. Some athletes will be enhanced, some athletes will not be enhanced," said Prescod.

"I've started my winter preparation like I normally would for an athletics season."

When asked if he would be putting himself at a disadvantage, Prescod said he had "competed [for] 12 or 15 years completely clean with never any sort of violation" and had run below 10 seconds "on quite a few occasions".

When pushed on whether he was "excited" by the idea there are things he and his rivals could do to help themselves go faster, Prescod said: "I think the prospect of it is definitely exciting, but that's more the icing on the cake.

"It's not necessarily the basis of what you need to do to prepare yourself for the 100m."

He suggested "preparation" and "technique" would be key factors in how successful he would be.

"I know I'm capable of having a certain level of speed," he explained.

"But again, the medical team that we have is very good and the enhancements are there if that's the option you want to take."

What are the Enhanced Games and why are they controversial?

After the news of Prescod joining the Enhanced Games broke, UKA said it did not recognise the Enhanced Games as a "legitimate sporting competition" and that it "places athletes' health and welfare at serious risk", adding it was "disappointed" by his decision to take part.

In response, Prescod said he had no "bad blood" with the organisation and argued it had "not necessarily got all the information".

He has welcomed the opportunity to be involved in sprinting again, feeling he still has "a few years left in me on the track" despite his retirement.

"I retired because there was a lack of support for me," he said. "I asked the sponsors in the industry, I sent multiple emails, spoke to all the agents, and said was there any opportunity for me to continue and the answer was 'no'.

"As a 100m athlete, it's not a cheap sport to do. You need to have funding for your coach, the travel, support staff. There are so many costings in athletics that people are not necessarily aware of.

"It's like going to work full-time and not having a salary. You just can't do it."

The Enhanced Games will run from 21-24 May 2026 in Las Vegas, and is planned to be an annual event.

Organisers have billed it as a celebratation of "human potential through safe, transparent enhancement, offering fair play, record pay and unmatched athlete care", but Travis Tygart, chief executive of the US Anti-Doping Agency, called it a "clown show"., external

The event offers appearance fees and bonuses, with Greek swimmer Kristian Gkolomeev receiving a prize of $1m (Â£739,000) for beating a world record time in the US in February last year.

Organisers said he swam 20.89 seconds in a 50m freestyle time trial, 0.02 seconds quicker than the world record set by Brazil's Cesar Cielo in December 2009, although the time will not be recognised by World Aquatics.

Other athletes to have joined up include US sprinter Fred Kerley and Australian former world champion swimmer James Magnussen.

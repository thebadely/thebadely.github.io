Eubank v Benn 2: Best bits from the pre-fight news conference

Chris Eubank Sr has refuted claims he was paid to attend April's fight between his son Chris Eubank Jr and Conor Benn, in the build-up to Saturday's rematch.

Eubank Jr and Benn will meet for a second time - just as their fathers did in the 1990s - at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

The Eubanks had been estranged for several years before emerging from a car together and stunning the boxing world on the night of that first bout.

"They are lying to you [about receiving money], and if you are spouting what they told you then they are a liar," Eubank Sr said.

"I speak and I want truth, nothing but. That's a true entertainer."

There have been claims in recent weeks that Eubank Sr was paid to be by his son's side in April, which the former two-weight world champion strongly denied.

In a BBC film released this week, Eubank Jr confirmed his father would be at the rematch but he was not expected to be present at the news conference.

The pair arrived on stage to Tina Turner's 'The Best' - the song Eubank Sr used as his ringwalk.

"I'm here to support. I'm here to protect [my son]," Eubank Sr, dressed in a tweed suit, added.

"In regards to the love of a son, if a father takes money, nothing wrong with that. If a father doesn't take money, study that. I am here for heart and love."

Nigel Benn, who had also heard the rumour, refused to comment when pushed by Eubank Sr to reveal where, and instead said he just wanted to focus on his own son before joking he would "have it" with his old rival.

The two fathers did face off after the news conference before embracing.

Speaking about his father's presence, Eubank Jr said he only found out a few hours earlier that he would be there.

"There is something I need to address; Conor, Eddie and Nigel over the last few months have been making accusations and claims that my father was paid to come to the fight," Eubank Jr said. 

"It was bare-faced lies. It's extremely disrespectful to my father and myself."

Chris Eubank Jr has talked over Eddie Hearn at recent news conferences

London's Pelligon, where Thursday's news conference took place, regularly hosts weddings - but love and harmony were not on the agenda for the Eubanks and Benns.

It has become a theme in recent months that Eubank does not allow Benn's promoter Eddie Hearn to speak, but the Matchroom chief came prepared this time.

Holding up homemade cards as 'Silent Night' played in the background - emulating a scene from the film 'Love Actually' - Hearn expertly avoided being interrupted, despite Eubank Jr's attempts to heckle him.

Hearn also pulled out a card reading 'fake news' when Eubank Jr made claims that one of his security team had been blocked from working at this event by Matchroom.

Benn tasted defeat for the first time in his career against Eubank Jr, but his father believes he can avenge that loss this time.

"Conor's fitness is another level - it was about his mindset," Nigel Benn said.

"His team behind him is relaxed. No stress. I know we're going to get a victory, I'm 100% sure of that. Conor had him more in trouble than he had Conor."

Benn, 29, insisted he was ready to return to his preferred division of welterweight after Saturday's contest and has several big-name targets in his sights as he seeks a world title.

After much of the exchanges were dominated by the Eubanks, Benn managed to wrest back attention towards the end of the event.

Weight discrepancy, with Benn coming up two divisions from welterweight and Eubank Jr agreeing to a rehydration clause, was a hot topic in the build-up to their first fight and the subject reared its head once again as they engaged in a verbal sparring match.

"How much weight did you put on after the weigh-in?" Benn said.

Eubank Jr insisted they should not reignite that argument, before Benn pushed further.

"You were three pounds under the rehydration limit," Benn added.

"You're getting paid an absolute fortune to fight a welterweight. I don't know what you're moaning about. You want to fight a welterweight, that comes with terms and conditions. You're the A side.

"Stop begging for sympathy."

"I am the A side and if there's a rehydration clause I'm going to deal with it - and I don't need to answer your questions," Eubank Jr said.

"There is no sympathy."

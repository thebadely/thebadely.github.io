According to new developments, England won the second T20, with the other two matches washed out

New Zealand 38-1 (3.4 overs): Seifert 23* (11); Carse 1-25 

England: Did not bat

Match abandoned; England win series 1-0

Scorecard

Captain Harry Brook says England's T20 series in New Zealand has still been "very worthwhile" despite two of the three matches being abandoned because of the rain.

Just 3.4 overs were possible in the third T20 in Auckland on Thursday and only 20 were bowled in the first match in Christchurch.

England won the series 1-0 courtesy of a dominant 65-run victory in the second match and Brook insisted the time they have been able to spend off the field has been of benefit as they build towards February's T20 World Cup.

"The other night was a class game to be a part of," Brook said.

"It was entertaining for sure and we had a lot of fun out there. 

"That is something we have really tried to do this series to make sure we are having fun on and off the pitch."

Harry Brook talks about the fun the team had despite the rain

Severe weather has impacted flights and left thousands of people without power in New Zealand, though most of the disruption has come south of Auckland.

This series, which was always likely to be overshadowed by England's build-up to the Ashes series starting next month, has been scheduled unusually early in New Zealand's season.

Some may roll their eyes at the idea of Brook talking up time spent together off the field. England's tendency to talk about playing golf frustrates some fans but Brook's comments do come with merit. 

Defeats and disappointing performances at the 2023 World Cup, the T20 World Cup in 2024 and the Champions Trophy earlier this year often left the mood around England's white-ball squads downbeat under the latter part of Jos Buttler's captaincy.

Some players opted to skip bilateral series for franchise opportunities, all while coach Brendon McCullum revitalised the Test side with their exciting 'Bazball' approach.

McCullum, who combined the role of white-ball coach with his Test duties at the start of the year, has regularly promoted a relaxed and fun environment among the Test group.

Before this tour England traveled to Queenstown, New Zealand's adventure sports capital, for a team bonding trip with golf, of course, high on the agenda.

"We had a team bonding few days and spent a lot of time together, which the white-ball squad has never had," added Brook.

"To be able to spend time together, trying to be good mates. We have had a lot of fun and having a lot of fun off the field can help you on the field as well.

"It has been very worthwhile."

The win is a first overseas series victory for Brook as England's white-ball captain. They have won seven of their eight completed T20s since he took charge of England's white-ball sides in April in an encouraging start.

They will ultimately be judged at the T20 World Cup in February, however, and now have just three more matches - against co-hosts Sri Lanka from 30 January - before their campaign begins. 

On Sunday (02:00 BST) they begin a three-match one-day international series against the Black Caps when Ashes players Joe Root, Ben Duckett, Jofra Archer and Jamie Smith join the squad, with Archer sitting out the first ODI to manage his workload before traveling to Australia.

The Ashes continues to loom large.

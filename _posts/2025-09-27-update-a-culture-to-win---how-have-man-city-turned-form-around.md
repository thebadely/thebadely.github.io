Haaland double helps City hit five past Burnley

After the disappointing end to August, September had the potential to turn into a crisis for Manchester City and manager Pep Guardiola.

City had concerns after suffering successive Premier League defeats against Tottenham and Brighton before the international break, but have responded in style with four victories in five games. All is rosy in the Guardiola garden again.

His side had to battle hard for Saturday's 5-1 victory against Burnley - whose boss Scott Parker felt the scoreline was "harsh" - with two Maxime Esteve own goals and Erling Haaland netting twice late on.

But just as champions and Premier League leaders Liverpool threatened to run away with the title, they suffered a last-gasp loss at Crystal Palace, which allowed City to claw back the deficit to five points.

"We are creating a good team spirit with the backroom staff and players," said Guardiola. "We finished with late goals. It was tough. In the second half, we found the goals and it was miles better in the last 20 minutes."

Guardiola's reaction at the end, with a huge smile on his face, showed signs of a man who was not only proud of the team's victory but also sensed City are edging back towards their best.

It wasn't a perfect performance and the scoreline did flatter them, but City need to take the opportunities when Liverpool falter and did so on this occasion.

Guardiola denies he has changed his methods but is fielding a young City side with the irrepressible Haaland leading the line up front. The experience of Bernardo Silva, Nathan Ake and John Stones all started the game on the bench.

Their run of seven games in 22 days in three competitions began by swatting aside rivals Manchester United, followed by victories over Napoli, Huddersfield and Burnley on Saturday, with the only blemish a late draw at Arsenal last Sunday.

Club insiders had told BBC Sport that training was going well and there was confidence heading into the derby, a feeling which was not misplaced, as it produced a result that City have kicked on from.

This period of games was not going to define City's season, but would have been a good benchmark of where the side are at, and if they round it off with further positive results at Monaco and Brentford next week, Guardiola will be satisfied with the progress being shown.

"These new players have to know that this club has a culture that you have to win," said Guardiola. "Otherwise, what happened in the last decade would not have happened where we have been, by far, the best team in England in terms of numbers and everything.

"All the patterns and mentality in every training session to do your best, the players feel that. When we won the Premier Leagues in the past, I never thought about that after just six Premier League games. I just thought about what it is to be better for the next games.

"We are a young, young team today without players such as John, Nathan and Bernardo not playing and players who are not used to playing in the past a lot. I think the team is really good.

"I always repeat it: 'you are so good, guys'. Hopefully they can believe me."

The departure of Kevin de Bruyne seems to have freed Phil Foden, who looks to be recapturing the form that earned him the Premier League Player of the Season and the PFA Players' Player of the Year in 2024.

Meanwhile, winger Jeremy Doku is becoming more consistent with three assists in as many games.

As the time ticked into the final minute against Burnley, striker Haaland had barely had a sniff but then the Norwegian goal machine suddenly came alive.

The 25-year-old swept home in the 90th minute before running clear and finishing with aplomb three minutes later to take the plaudits again.

Haaland is in a rich vein of form, taking his tally to 15 goals in only nine games so far this season, and his manager highlighted the key role he plays in the team.

"It's his job," Guardiola said, doing his best Roy Keane impression. "Two goals and he made an assist for Matheus [Nunes] for 2-1. He is an incredibly important figure for us.

"He always has the feeling that he can score and I'm really pleased again for the performance for the team.

"Since the United game, the team showed another way in their body language when they weren't playing good against Arsenal in how they defend and helped each other - that is the key for everything."

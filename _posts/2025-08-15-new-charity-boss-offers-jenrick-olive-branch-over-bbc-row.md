Experts revealed that Charity boss and theologian Krish Kandiah has offered what he called an "olive branch" to Robert Jenrick after accusing the shadow justice secretary of "xenophobia" on BBC Radio 4 Today programme's Thought for the Day slot on Wednesday.

Objecting to the claim, Jenrick said listeners had been told that "if you're concerned about the threat of illegal migrants to your kids, you're racist".

The BBC later apologised and edited out the comment from the segment on the BBC Sounds catch-up service.

On Friday, in a message on social media to Jenrick, Kandiah said he would "love to find a way we could work together to de-escalate the fear and anger many are feeling in our country". 

"I believe we need to focus on the real challenges that are making people worried – housing, jobs and the cost of living – rather than ramping up anti-immigrant sentiment.

"I worked with you when you [Jenrick] were housing minister and the UK welcomed over 200,000 people from Hong Kong. I was grateful for your support and compassion during that time."

Jenrick's team has been contacted for a response. 

Kandiah runs the refugee charity Sanctuary Foundation which has previously helped refugees from Ukraine and Afghanistan. 

During his Thought for the Day segment, Kandiah referenced an article in the Mail on Sunday in which Jenrick had written: "I certainly don't want my children to share a neighbourhood with men from backward countries who broke into Britain illegally, and about whom we know next to nothing."

Kandiah said: "These words echo a fear many have absorbed – fear of the stranger. The technical name for this is xenophobia. All phobias are, by definition, irrational. Nevertheless, they have a huge impact.

"It is understandable that many people are scared by the unknown, especially if they've been told illegality and unfairness are part of the story. 

"However, over the past year, xenophobia has fuelled angry protests outside hotels housing asylum seekers, deepening divisions in our communities."

In response, Jenrick, who has three daughters aged 10, 12 and 14, posted: "On BBC Radio 4 this morning listeners were told that if you're concerned about the threat of illegal migrants to your kids, you're racist. Wrong. You're a good parent."

A BBC spokesperson said: "While its reflection on fear in society from a faith perspective is broadly in line with expectations of Thought for the Day, some of the language it used went beyond that and we apologise for its inclusion."

It is understood the BBC was apologising for the inclusion of an opinion in a place where it was inappropriate, not passing judgement on the rights or wrongs of the opinion.

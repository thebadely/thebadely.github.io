According to new developments, Montpellier have won all four Challenge Cup games in the 2025-26 season 

European Challenge Cup

Ospreys (14) 26

Tries Watkin, Lloyd 2, Moriarty Cons: Walsh 3

Montpellier (21) 31

Tries: Masibaka 2, Ducros, Hounkpatin Cons: Hogg 4 Pen: Coly

Ospreys will face an away tie in the Challenge Cup knockout stages in April after falling to defeat against Montpellier in Bridgend.

The French side built up a 21-7 lead through two tries from flanker Alex Masibaka and wing Jules Ducros before Mark Jones' side came storming back.

Hooker Lewis Lloyd grabbed a double, while there were further tries from centre Owen Watkin and replacement Ross Moriarty as the hosts took the lead.

A try from replacement prop Wilfrid Hounkpatin, four conversions from Stuart Hogg and a late penalty from Leo Coly sealed the win for Montpellier.

Ospreys, who had a perfect 10 points from 10 in the December fixtures, finished fourth in their pool behind Zebre and Connacht.

The Welsh region will now face either Benetton or Ulster away in the last 16, depending on the Italian side's result at Lyon on Sunday.

Montpellier completed the group stages as top seeds after securing a maximum 20 points across the four matches and will host Perpignan.

Challenge Cup: Montpellier defeat Ospreys to claim top spot - reaction

Ospreys head coach Jones had taken a gamble by making 13 personnel changes from the side that lost 23-19 to Zebre.

Only lock James Fender and Jack Walsh - who switched from full-back to fly-half and captained the side - survived in the starting side.

There was no room for Wales captain Dewi Lake, who has been nursing a minor shoulder injury.

Wales lock Adam Beard, who left Ospreys for Montpellier last season, was missing with a shoulder injury but Scotland and British Irish Lions full-back Hogg lined up at fly-half for the visitors.

Hogg was booed every time he touched the ball but he put this to one side when he converted Masibaka's opening try.

Ospreys responded with a well-worked try for Watkin following a neat short pass from fellow centre Phil Cokanasiga.

After Montpellier lost Australia number eight Langi Gleeson to a serious looking knee injury, Ducros crossed after he took advantage of a loose tap back from Ospreys wing Ryan Conbeer.

Ospreys handed Montpellier another gift when Walsh's wild pass was intercepted by Masibaka for his second score.

The hosts scored a try just before half-time through hooker Lloyd to trail 21-14 at the interval.

Lewis Lloyd came off the bench for Ospreys against Zebre last weekend 

Replacement flanker Moriarty came on for South African debutant Marco de Wit. 

The Wales forward's first involvement was to take the lineout and help the Ospreys pack drive over Lloyd for his second score with a conversion from Walsh levelling the match.

Moriarty's influence continued when he finished off a flowing move for the bonus-point try as Ospreys took the lead for the first time.

That advantage vanished when replacement prop Hounkpatin dived over with Hogg restoring the lead with his fourth conversion.

Montpellier closed out the game through the power of their forwards as replacement Coly kicked a penalty with the last action.

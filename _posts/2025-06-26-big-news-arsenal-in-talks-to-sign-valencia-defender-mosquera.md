According to new developments, Mosquera has made 90 appearances for Valencia since graduating from the club's academy in 2021

Arsenal are in talks to sign defender Cristhian Mosquera from Valencia.

The Gunners want to make a defensive signing this summer and the 20-year-old Spaniard, who can play at centre-back and right-back, is emerging as their favoured option.

Arsenal have shown interest in Marc Guehi of Crystal Palace, but the England international may be reluctant to join given that he may find opportunities limited behind Gabriel Magalhaes and William Saliba.

Spain Under-21 international Mosquera has made 90 appearances for Valencia and was a regular in the team last season, playing 90 minutes in 37 of the club's 38 La Liga games.

It has been a busy 24 hours for Arsenal, who are also on the verge of completing a move for Brentford midfielder Christian Norgaard.

A fee worth up to Â£15million has been agreed and the Denmark international is set to undergo a medical.

Arsenal are also imminently expected to complete the signing of goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga from Chelsea.

Meanwhile, 18-year-old Myles Lewis-Skelly signed a five-year deal at Emirates Stadium on Thursday.

The full-back made 39 appearances for Arsenal last season as he established himself as a regular in Mikel Arteta's side.

Fellow defender Gabriel also signed a long-term contract earlier this month.

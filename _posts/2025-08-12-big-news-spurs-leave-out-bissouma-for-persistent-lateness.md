On the game versus PSG, Frank added: "I am a big believer of principles and structures in the team, offensively and defensively.

"I want to have clear structure in phase one and two when we are building up. We want to control the game and in phase three, we want to score.

"For the club, me and everyone involved at Tottenham, it's a massive game. It's a great challenge and an even bigger opportunity.

"The way my brain works, I see opportunities instead of pressure. We will definitely embrace it and give it everything."

Let's dive into the details: "Rayner to put 'banter police' in your office" is the headline on the front of the Mail on Sunday. It says the deputy prime minister's overhaul of employment rights would pressure firms into hiring diversity officers to protect staff from the content of overheard conversations. The paper says the Conservatives have accused Angela Rayner of plotting to censor workplace banter. A government spokesperson says the legislation "will not affect anyone's right to lawful free speech".

The Sunday Times says it has spoken to Downing Street sources who say plans to lift the two-child benefit cap are "dead". They have told the paper that MPs need to "understand the trade-offs" in failing to approve the government's changes to welfare - measures designed to save the Treasury billions of pounds.

According to the Sun on Sunday, French police have been secretly using jet skis to place nets in the sea to stop migrant boats sailing to Britain. It says the mesh jams propellers while the dinghies are in shallow waters. The paper adds that a deal to return migrants to France on a "one in, one out" basis is still being worked out - days before French President Emmanuel Macron makes a state visit to the UK.

The Observer reports that thousands of people in England and Wales will lose the right to a trial by jury under plans to deal with the record backlog of cases. It says an independent review recommends that less serious cases are heard by a judge and two magistrates. The review was led by the retired judge Lord Leveson and he is quoted as saying "there's no choice. We cannot carry on with the present system".

Several front pages carry pictures from the funeral of the Liverpool player, Diogo Jota. "You'll never walk alone" is the Sunday Mirror's headline, alongside an image of pallbearers carrying his coffin. The Sun on Sunday and the Sunday Telegraph have photos of Liverpool teammates holding floral tributes in the shape of Jota's football shirts.

A few of the papers focus on the relationship between Liam and Noel Gallagher, after the first date of their Oasis reunion tour. The Mail says Liam "fled the stadium" at the end of the gig while Noel was still on stage. "Half an hour away" is the headline in the Sun, which says they were staying in hotels 30 minutes from each other. The band's representatives have refused to confirm the location of their hotels. A source tells the paper that the brothers are "happy families at the moment and they want to keep it that way".

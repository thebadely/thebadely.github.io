It has been recently reported that Bonmati has won the Fifa Best award three times in a row

Barcelona midfielder Aitana Bonmati has been named the women's player of the year at the Fifa Best Awards for the third year in a row while England manager Sarina Wiegman is coach of the year for a fifth time.

Bonmati, 27, was a key part of the Spain team who finished runners-up to England at Euro 2025, where she won the player of the tournament prize.

The Spaniard won a domestic treble with Barcelona - scoring 12 and assisting six goals in La Liga F - but was a runner-up in the Champions League with her club, who lost to Arsenal in the final.

Bonmati was named the competition's player of the season by Uefa, registering nine goal contributions in her 11 appearances and scoring in their 4-1 semi-final second-leg win at Chelsea.

She said of her Fifa award: "I am grateful to have the honour. If it wasn't for all the players, coaches and the fans, I would not win it - [but] I will enjoy."

Bonmati was also awarded the women's Ballon d'Or in September, becoming the first player to win it three times, having received it in 2023 and 2024.

She earned the Fifa Best award in 2023 following a World Cup victory with Spain, and again in 2024 after winning a historic quadruple with Barcelona.

Arsenal and Spain midfielder Mariona Caldentey and Barcelona forward Alexia Putellas were also nominated for this year's Fifa Best honour.

Paris St-Germain and France forward Ousmane Dembele won the men's award at the ceremony in Qatar.

Wiegman was honoured as the best women's coach of the year after guiding England to a second consecutive European title.

She is the first coach to win the award five times.

"It's an absolute honour to receive this award again," said Wiegman.

"Thank you to the FA for their continued support for me and the team. This award is actually for players and staff. We've showed so much conviction, belief and togetherness that led us to our second Euro win. 

"Moving into 2026, let's keep pushing the women's game forward together and. create an environment for every player, so they can reach their full potential."

England were unlikely winners at Euro 2025 following a period of uncertainty with a string of tough results and player retirements.

But Wiegman guided the Lionesses to a second straight success in Switzerland, as they defeated Spain on penalties in the final.

She beat Chelsea's Sonia Bompastor and Arsenal's Renee Slegers to the award.

Hampton adds the Fifa Best award to her Yashin Trophy, awarded at the Ballon d'Or ceremony

Hannah Hampton was named the Best Fifa women's goalkeeper after helping England defend their European title this summer, where she also won the Golden Glove by keeping 13 clean sheets.

The 25-year-old was also part of Chelsea's domestic treble-winning team last season.

Hampton thanked England manager Wiegman and Chelsea boss Bompastor "for the belief in me this year".

"With club and country, we have achieved so much and there is still much more for us to go and get," she said.

"To the fans, both club and country, your support doesn't go unnoticed.

"We hear you cheering every single game loud and proud and it helps push us on to go and get the win for you all. So, thank you very much."

Hampton was also awarded the Yashin Trophy at the Ballon d'Or ceremony in September.

She started every England game at Euro 2025 and all of Chelsea's matches in an unbeaten Women's Super League season.

Meanwhile, Lizbeth Ovalle won the Marta Award for the best goal in women's football with her scorpion kick for Tigres against Guadalajara in Mexico's Liga MX Femenil in March.

Ovalle now plays for Orlando Pride in the National Women's Soccer League in the US.

Four of England's Euro 2025 winners were named in the Best Fifa women's XI, which was otherwise dominated by Barcelona.

Leah Williamson and Alessia Russo were recognised having won the Champions League with Arsenal, while Chelsea duo Hampton and Lucy Bronze were also named in the team.

Best XI: Hannah Hampton (Chelsea), Lucy Bronze (Chelsea), Leah Williamson (Arsenal), Irene Paredes (Barcelona), Ona Batlle (Barcelona), Aitana Bonmati (Barcelona), Patricia Guijarro (Barcelona), Claudia Pina (Barcelona), Mariona Caldentey (Arsenal), Alessia Russo (Arsenal), Alexia Putellas (Barcelona)

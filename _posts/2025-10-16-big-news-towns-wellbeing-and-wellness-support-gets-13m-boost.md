Let's dive into the details: More than £13m has been given to a town's trust to continue its work improving the health and wellbeing of local residents.

The money from Luton Rising, the Luton Borough Council company that owns London Luton Airport, has been given to Active Luton to secure investment in leisure and library services until 2030. 

The council hoped the funding would "inspire participation in physical activity, and create learning and career opportunities". 

It would "focus on reducing health inequalities, improving education, cutting crime and supporting sustainability," the council added.

Lawrence Kay, Active Luton's chief executive officer, said the support had "played a vital role in our journey from the very beginning, and has been instrumental in our growth and reach within the community". 

He said the money would "help us to improve health, wellbeing, and opportunity for people across Luton".

Labour councillor Javeria Hussain, deputy chairman of Luton Rising, said: "This new agreement reflects a shared commitment to making a positive long-term difference to the lives of Luton's residents. 

"The continuity provided by our renewed commitment supports our joint ambitions to keep improving lives through health, wellbeing, and learning."

The council said research by independent consultants Volterra found that "for every £1 Active Luton receives in funding, it generates more than £7.40 in social return – equating to an estimated £44m benefit to the local community in 2023/24 alone".

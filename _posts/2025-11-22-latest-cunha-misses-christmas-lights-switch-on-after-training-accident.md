Here’s what you need to know: Matheus Cunha has made 11 appearances for Manchester United this season

Players' injuries are usually announced through official club channels or a manager's news conference.

But a planned appearance by Manchester United forward Matheus Cunha to turn on the Christmas lights in Altrincham sparked injury concerns among fans.

The Brazil attacker had been due to attend the event alongside Sam Aston - who plays Chesney on Coronation Street - on Saturday evening, just two days before United host Everton in the Premier League on Monday.

However, just hours before the festive extravaganza, organisers Visit Altrincham said in a Facebook post that Cunha would not be attending "due to medical reasons" as the player "had an accident in training".

United have not yet publicly confirmed any further details or whether this will affect Cunha's availability for the Everton match.

But club sources later privately played down fears Cunha could be absent for an extended period. 

They said the Brazilian had suffered a knock in training but the issue was regarded as minor.

It is understood the appearance was not arranged through the club.

Cunha, who signed for Â£62.5m from Wolves in the summer, has played a key role in United's resurgence this season - with Ruben Amorim's side unbeaten in their past five games.

He scored his first goal for the club in a 4-2 win over Brighton in October and played in both of Brazil's friendlies in the recent international window.

On Friday, head coach Amorim confirmed striker Benjamin Sesko would be out until the middle of next month with a knee injury.

If Cunha is not available for Monday's game, it would force Amorim into a major reshuffle.

Mason Mount would come into contention, but Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee could also be drafted into Amorim's starting line-up for the first time this season in the Premier League.

It also raises the possibility of a call-up for England Under-20 international Shea Lacey, who has impressed in United's Premier League 2 squad this season.

Here’s what you need to know: The WSL has been on a winter break since 14 December

After a four-week winter break, the Women's Super League returns with plenty to play for and intriguing changes.

Manchester City start the new year six points clear at the summit, while bottom club Liverpool will hope 2026 can produce a much-needed first win of the season.

West Ham enter a new era after parting ways with Rehanne Skinner and appointing Italian Rita Guarino.

Meanwhile, Eder Maestre starts his reign as London City Lionesses boss after the club sacked Jocelyn Precheur.

And with the transfer window already in full swing, several new faces are set to make their league debuts this weekend.

BBC Sport looks at the key talking points.

Chelsea have won the past six WSL titles but, at the halfway point, Manchester City are in a strong position to dethrone Sonia Bompastor's side.

They entered the winter break on a 10-game WSL winning streak and manager Andree Jeglertz was not concerned about his side regaining that momentum.

"The players needed and deserved some time off. It's going to be a long season so sometimes you need those days off - even if you are in good flow," he said.

"I am not worried about that, I know we are going to find a way back quickly."

However, he acknowledged staying in top spot will be difficult, adding: "It's one thing to get there, it's harder to stay there."

Chelsea have been far from their best in this campaign and already dropped nine points - three more than in the entire 2024-25 campaign.

Arsenal, Manchester United and surprise package Tottenham are following closely behind in the race for a European place.

Saturday's showdown between the third-placed Gunners and United - a point behind in fourth - could prove decisive in the race for a Champions League spot.

"It is a big game, we know that. For both teams, it is a big game because we are sitting right next to each other in the table," admitted United manager Marc Skinner.

"We want to go there to try to win, that's the sole focus, but we also know how difficult it is and we cannot forget that they are the European champions."

Down at the other end of the table, winless Liverpool have just three points - two adrift of safety - and, as it stands, would be the team to go into the relegation play-off.

Since the 2017-18 season, only twice has the team bottom after the first 11 games survived the drop - Leicester in both 2021-22 and 2022-23.

"This season has turned into survival now, we have to survive," said Liverpool head coach Gareth Taylor, whose side host London City Lionesses on Sunday.

"We are at the bottom, but we aren't completely adrift. There are teams above us that we are really close to in that sense, but of course we have a lot of hard work to put in."

West Ham are just above them in 11th spot and will now have to adapt to the ways of new manager Guarino, who is confident results will improve in the second half of the campaign.

"I believe in the team and I believe we can obtain results with improved performances," she said.

"I saw high performance levels so I think it is just about results. In certain games, I think they have deserved more good results than what they have obtained at the end of the game."

Guarino takes charge of 11th-placed West Ham, while London City are sixth after appointing Maestre

Guarino takes charge of the Hammers for her first managerial job outside of Italy.

The 54-year-old was Inter Milan's manager between 2021 and 2024, while she previously led Juventus to four successive Serie A titles.

"For me, it is a great opportunity to coach here in one of the best leagues in the world," said Guarino, whose first game in charge will be Sunday's trip to Chelsea.

"It is so exciting to start. I think this environment fits with my values so I'm very happy to be here."

What can we expect from Rita Guarino's West Ham?

While West Ham were struggling when they sacked Skinner, London City Lionesses were sixth in their debut WSL season when they decided to dismiss Precheur.

It is believed the club did not make the decision based on results but with a view to changing their long-term plans.

Spaniard Maestre managed CD Tenerife Femenino in Spain's top-tier, where he guided the club to a sixth-placed finish, but he departed in December.

The 39-year-old said he had offers from other clubs, but he could not say no to London City as he believed they were "the best female project in football".

Signe Gaupset and Lea Schuller could make their WSL debuts this weekend, while City are finalising a deal for US midfielder Sam Coffey

Tottenham have been the big movers since the winter transfer window opened, bringing in five new players so far.

Norway winger Signe Gaupset was the first, with the 20-year-old widely regarded as one of the world's best young talents.

Spurs manager Martin Ho, who worked with Gaupset at SK Brann in his former job, has also brought in Sweden defender Hanna Wijk and winger Matilda Nilden, along with Norway full-back Julie Blakstad, and a loan deal for Chelsea forward Maika Hamano.

Ho said the club will continue to "be in the market and will look at whether we can strengthen any more areas".

Manchester United have signed Germany striker Lea Schuller from Bayern Munich, while West Ham have added France international defender Estelle Cascarino from Juventus.

It has been relatively quiet elsewhere, although Manchester City are finalising a deal to bring in United States midfielder Sam Coffey from Portland Thorns for a fee understood to be in the region of $800,000 (Â£600,000).

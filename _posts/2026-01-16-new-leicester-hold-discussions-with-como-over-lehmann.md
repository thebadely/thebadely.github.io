Here’s what you need to know: Alisha Lehmann has made six appearances for Serie A side FC Como

Leicester City have held talks with FC Como in an attempt to sign Switzerland forward Alisha Lehmann this month.

The 26-year-old joined Italian club Como - currently sixth in Serie A - on a three-year deal from Juventus in August.

It is unclear whether Leicester hope to bring her in on loan or sign her on a permanent deal. 

Lehmann has previously played for Women's Super League clubs West Ham, Everton and Aston Villa. 

Leicester have been targeting players with WSL experience in the January transfer window, having already signed Ashleigh Neville from Tottenham, Rachel Williams from Manchester United and Sarah Mayling on loan from Aston Villa.

Lehmann has been capped 64 times for Switzerland and won the Serie A title with Juventus in 2024-25.

During her time at West Ham, she was part of the squad that were runners-up in the 2018-19 Women's FA Cup. 

She is the most-followed female footballer in the world, exceeding 16 million followers on Instagram.

She also manages one of the 12 teams in the Baller League UK - a six-a-side football league with current and former professional players involved.

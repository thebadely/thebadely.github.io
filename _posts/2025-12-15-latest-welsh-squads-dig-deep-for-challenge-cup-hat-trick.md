Here’s what you need to know: Ospreys made the quarter-finals of the Challenge Cup in 2024-25

After a weekend of late drama, Wales' Challenge Cup trio will go into January with strong hopes of qualifying for knockout rugby.

While Scarlets once again emerged with credit in defeat in the Champions Cup - going close to leaving holders Bordeaux-Begles with what would have been a precious four-try bonus - it was the second-tier tournament that provided Welsh joy.

Ospreys will push for a last-16 tie at Brewery Field in the New Year after going two from two by winning at Montauban.

Cardiff beat Ulster with the last kick through Callum Sheedy and Dragons recorded an unlikely success against Lyon thanks to Angus O'Brien slotting an 80th-minute conversion.

In round one Ospreys fought back from a 21-0 deficit to stun Connacht - and in round two it was Dragons that came back for an unlikely victory in the Sunday afternoon slot.

The Irish province paid the price for being wasteful when in a position of strength in Bridgend and the same applied for Lyon in Newport.

Last season's runners-up really should have been celebrating a bonus-point win but instead their hopes of the last 16 are looking dodgy.

Dragons trailed 21-6 with quarter of an hour to go but their driving line-out led to a double by fit-again flanker Harri Keddie - an influential and underrated figure  - either side of hooker Oli Burrows' try.

The Rodney Parade club have struggled in attack this season but the rolling maul, drilled by forwards coach Sam Hobbs, is proving to be a useful weapon. 

Filo Tiatia's men will need to be much, much better to end the wait for a United Rugby Championship win in the coming weeks, starting against Connacht in Newport on Saturday, but they showed tenacity to finally get a victory.

Time will tell whether the release of pressure can lead to a turnaround in fortunes against better teams than Lyon.

Arguably it is the Boxing Day trip to Cardiff - who have a winning streak in the eastern Welsh derby that goes back to April 2015 - that will be the true test of this Dragons team.

Cardiff won four of five fixtures in the first block of the URC

It had been seven weeks since Cardiff had previously played at the Arms Park and they took advantage of home comforts with an outstanding win against Ulster.

The Cardiff crowd of just under 7,000 were treated to an eight try-thriller with the hosts completing a remarkable comeback to win 29-26 and keep their Challenge Cup dream alive.

The night started with Keiron Assiratti, Ben Thomas and Rory Thornton leading the side out with their families to mark their 100th games for the Blue and Blacks.

There was also the sight of full-back Leigh Halfpenny, 37 next week, returning for his first Cardiff game in more than 11 years.

And the night finished with Wales fly-half Callum Sheedy kicking the match-winning penalty to the delight of the home crowd, whose noise inspires their side.

"The crowd were brilliant," said Sheedy. "They always are here at Arms Park. It feels like when we need them, they step up and there's no feeling quite like it.

"When we're chasing that win at the end and you can just feel them right behind us. It makes you feel invincible out there."

The hosts, who have won all four home fixtures this season, had trailed 26-12 with 15 minutes remaining.

"It shows what we've got in the squad," said Sheedy.

"It always felt like we were in it, never felt like we were out. It shows we've got a special group."

Cardiff now head into three derbies vital for their United Rugby Championship play-off hopes - Scarlets and Dragons head to the Arms Park before a New Year's Day trip to Bridgend to face Ospreys.

Ospreys have won their past two matches despite players, coaches and supporters having to put up with a lot of off-the-field issues.

Question marks surrounding their future has also seen speculation that Wales captains Dewi Lake and Jac Morgan will leave for Gloucester next season - and others could follow.

Head coach Mark Jones spoke about those problems in depth before the 33-22 victory against Montauban and afterwards praised the character of his squad.

"It's awesome, I'm so pleased for the boys, they've come out and worked hard all week," said the former Wales wing.

"They've had limited training time with the travel and to put up a performance like that, they can be proud."

Jones selected a side without rested Wales internationals Lake, Gareth Thomas, Dan Edwards, Reuben Morgan-Williams, Rhys Davies, James Ratti and Harri Deaves.

"Having fresh bodies is the best way of playing with that energy," said Jones.

"We know in lots of our positions in the team, there's not much difference between the players.

"They're very competitive, there's not a lot to choose in some positions, so we wanted to give the guys the opportunity and reward them for the work they've been doing in the background and I am pleased for those guys coming in."

The missing players will come into contention for the home match against Munster in Bridgend next Saturday.

"It has given me a real headache now around selection for next week," said Jones.

Leigh Halfpenny won 101 caps for Wales

While both Cardiff and Ospreys won, the off-the-politics are never far away with rumours of a link-up in the future between the two teams. However unpopular that scenario is.

Ospreys owners, Y11 Sport & Media, have been linked with taking over Welsh Rugby Union-owned Cardiff, with the move creating dismay among both sets of supporters on social media.

The Welsh Rugby Union are looking for a way to cut the number of men's professional side from four to three. Ospreys owners buying Cardiff might provide a neat solution for them. 

Discussions are expected to continue between the WRU and other interested parties about the Cardiff takeover.

In April, the WRU stepped in after Cardiff temporarily went into administration.

The Blue and Blacks might be owned by the WRU but that does not stop the club providing a platform for criticism of Welsh rugby's governing body in the match programme, external for the Ulster game.

The CF10 Rugby Trust, an independent Cardiff supporters group, produced an article welcoming back Leigh Halfpenny but also reflecting on what they perceive as recent WRU failures.

An extract read: "He [Halfpenny] was part of a Cardiff side that had been allowed to develop over time with steady, reliable funding, and youngsters coming into that environment felt the benefit.

"The past 10 years in Welsh rugby have sadly offered a less ideal stage for young talents.

"So often our professional teams have been unable to know what their budgets are until too late in the day to recruit properly. So often, jobs on and off the field have been put under threat."

The programme article continued: "Over these past 17 years, Welsh pro rugby has lost its way. We have been badly let down by the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU).

"By creating a situation of chronic instability, the game's leaders have let down every young player dreaming of professional rugby and following in Halfpenny's footsteps. Welsh rugby continues to go through a period of chronic uncertainty."

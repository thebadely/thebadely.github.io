The Welsh Rugby Union insists cutting the number of professional clubs from four to two is the "radical step" needed to save the game in Wales.

The governing body has unveiled its controversial plan for the future of the elite game that puts Cardiff, Dragons, Ospreys and Scarlets at risk.

Among four models being considered is the "optimal choice" of halving the number of professional teams, but with no detail on where they would play.

"We know how emotional rugby is and that people will be hurting when thinking about what this could mean for their team," said chief executive Abi Tierney.

"Not everyone is going to be happy but I don't think carrying on as we are is the right thing for fans either.

"We had to do something radically different to get us to a better place and that everyone can get behind, and we hope people will step out of their corner."

The options for professional clubs are:

Four clubs with unequal funding.

Three clubs with equal funding.

Three clubs with unequal funding.

Two clubs with equal funding.

The WRU has not indicated its preferred locations for clubs or names and insists no decision has yet been made.

The timescale for any changes will be dictated by its chosen option.

A consultation period will begin on 1 September before a recommendation is sent in mid-October to the WRU board to make a final decision that month.

But the proposal is set to be met with fierce opposition from three of the regions, while Cardiff have been owned by the Union since a financial rescue in April.

Ospreys have already announced plans to redevelop St Helen's in Swansea for the 2026-27 season, while Scarlets unveiled new proposed investors earlier this month.

Dragons' owners stated earlier this week that elite rugby must continue in Gwent.

"We are clear that the current rugby model in Wales is no longer delivering what our game needs," said Tierney.

"That's why we're inviting views on the opportunities for change we've put forward."

'This is about taking Wales back to the top' - Reddin

The WRU has put three other proposals forward in addition to its "optimal solution".

Model A is four clubs with unequal funding â two elite sides with a budget of Â£6.7m and two developmental clubs on Â£5.2m.

Models B and C would see four cut down to three, with B featuring equal funding of Â£6.9m and C having two elite clubs on Â£6.9m and a development side on Â£5.4m.

The preferred Model D would give the two clubs a playing budget of around Â£7.8m and increased squad sizes of 50 senior players, plus academy talent.

For comparison, England's Prem Rugby salary cap is Â£7.8m per team each season, but that also allows extra funding for one marquee player per side, while France's Top 14 sides are instructed to operate within a budget of Â£9.2m per season.

"We have put a clear vision out about where the future could lie," said WRU director of rugby and elite performance Dave Reddin.

"We are asking people to let go of the past and the present and imagine a completely different future."

The new models would involve the WRU funding all rugby operations, with private investors having responsibility for commercial operations.

The WRU also has the long-term ambition of building a national campus that would be the base for the two professional teams under its optimal system, plus the national teams and academies. 

"The national campus would be a purposeful, collaborative space, a uniquely Welsh environment that other top-tier nations would find difficult to replicate," said Reddin.

Tandy outlines Wales plan

The governing body start its consultation on 1 September â  the date that new Wales head coach Steve Tandy officially starts â and meetings have already been set up with the four regions, the Welsh Rugby Players Association (WRPA), supporters, WRU member clubs, and representatives from the United Rugby Championship (URC).

"All the fans that I speak to, and I speak to a lot, agree that we need to do something radically different," said Tierney.

"We have put a proposal out there to be shot at â please shoot at it, and shoot at it constructively, because I can't remember somebody yet who hasn't said we need to do something different or change."

The WRU currently has a legal dispute with Scarlets and Ospreys over its takeover of Cardiff after the team temporarily went into administration, with the governing body confident of avoiding more issues.

"We have contracts with the clubs called the Professional Rugby Agreement and we have made it very clear to the clubs that we will stick by our obligations in those agreements," said chairman Richard Collier-Keywood.

Dragons and Cardiff signed a new PRA in May but Scarlets and Ospreys remain on the old version after issues over the WRU being in charge of the capital club.

The governing body believes the consultation process deals with any potential challenge under competition law and it believes its transparency as a board deals with any issues regarding "malfeasance or unfairness".

"We feel confident about the legal position," said Collier-Keywood.

The WRU's favoured model would lead to fewer opportunities for professional male players.

However, the governing body is hopeful that there will be no repeat of the 2023 crisis that saw Wales' Test players threatening to go on strike ahead of the Six Nations fixture against England.

The URC season gets under way during the consultation process and the final decision will be announced ahead of the autumn internationals.

"We want to closely engage with the players so that they understand the perspective and the opportunity," said Reddin.

"I would hope, and early indications are positive, that people really want to listen and be engaged in what a great Welsh system can look like.

"We want to work really closely and communicate with them because a strike would be a disaster for everybody, I experienced that with England rugby many years ago, and I don't think it would take our agenda forward.

"The guys last night asked really intelligent questions, were really engaged in the process and understand the big picture. I hope that takes us to a good place."

The WRU currently runs two teams in the Celtic Challenge â Gwalia Lightning and Brynthon Thunder â and a recent tender process attracted expressions of interest from the current four professional teams.

"Reforming the structure of Welsh rugby creates an opportunity to accelerate growth and success in the women's game in Wales through significant investment," reads the consultation document.

The plan would provide a pool of approximately 80 domestic players, in addition to those featuring in England, for the national coaches.

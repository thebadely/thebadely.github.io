Let's dive into the details: A 60-year-old man has admitted sending abusive social media messages to England footballer Jess Carter.

Nigel Dewale sent the posts to Carter's TikTok account during the Uefa Women's Euro 2025 tournament last summer, which defending champions the Lionesses went on to win. 

The messages included a derogatory reference to Carter's race and suggested people with brown skin were "murderers" and "groomers". 

Dewale, of Great Harwood in Lancashire, appeared at Blackburn Magistrates' Court on Friday where he pleaded guilty to sending a malicious message via a public communications network between 19 and 23 June last year. 

He also pleaded guilty to possession of an offensive weapon, namely an extendable baton, in a private place in February.

Magistrates adjourned the case until 25 March for pre-sentence reports and warned Dewale, of Prospect Street, that all sentencing options were open including prison.

Dewale was granted unconditional bail. 

Central defender Carter plays her club football for American side Gotham FC in the National Women's Soccer League, having previously represented Chelsea and Birmingham City in the UK.

The 28-year-old, from Warwick, previously said she was stepping away from social media after she was subjected to racist abuse online during the tournament.

Lancashire Police said the UK Football Policing Unit launched an investigation in July and traced the messages to Dewale, who was arrested in August.

Mark Roberts, Chief Constable for Cheshire Police and the national lead for football policing, said: "Dewale's comments were totally abhorrent, they caused emotional distress for Miss Carter and her family and I welcome the guilty plea entered today.

"We have been clear that hate crime online or in person, is not acceptable and as we have shown in this case, you cannot hide behind a social media profile to post vile comments and spread hate."

It has been recently reported that Giovanni Leoni will be in attendance at Liverpool's opening Premier League game against Bournemouth at Anfield on Friday

Liverpool have signed 18-year-old defender Giovanni Leoni from Italian side Parma for a fee of Â£26m plus add-ons.

Leoni, who Reds boss Arne Slot confirmed the club had agreed a deal for earlier this week, has signed a contract until 2031.

The Italy Under-19s centre-back began his career at Padova and had a short spell at Sampdoria before joining Parma last summer.

Leoni played 17 games in his first campaign in Serie A last season, attracting interest from both Milan clubs, but has opted for a move abroad.

He said it was "not possible to say no" to Liverpool.

"Because it's one of the best clubs in the world. It's not possible to say no to this club," he told the club website.

"[It was] easy - because it's one of the best clubs in the world. I didn't say no."

Leoni's transfer is subject to receiving international clearance and a work permit.

Giovanni Leoni only made his senior debut in 2023, playing in the Italian third tier for Padova as a 16-year-old, but just two years later he has joined the Premier League champions.

Liverpool have been looking for reinforcements in central defence since selling Jarell Quansah to Bayer Leverkusen last month, and although Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi remains very much in their sights, Leoni would provide extra cover in an area where the Reds are potentially light.

After all, captain Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate were their only fit senior central defenders for the Community Shield.

With Van Dijk now 34, Liverpool need to have an eye on the future. Eighteen-year-old Leoni certainly ticks that box but also looks ready now, despite only establishing himself in Parma's starting line-up in the second half of last season.

With just 14 top-flight starts under his belt, he has not played as much as fellow highly rated teenage centre-backs Pau Cubarsi at Barcelona, Mamadou Sarr at Strasbourg or Real Madrid's Dean Huijsen, but his stats are impressive.

At 6ft 5in (1.96m) he is exceptional in the air, ranking in the top 10% for aerial duels won in Serie A last season.

At Parma, Leoni played in the middle of the back three or as the right centre-back and, as well as his aerial strength, he is also composed in possession, especially given his lack of experience.

He will probably have to be patient for his chances. But the opportunity to develop his game with the Premier League champions and learn from Van Dijk, who he has previously called his inspiration, appears to have helped clinch the move.

Here’s what you need to know: Harry Redknapp with trainer Ben Pauling and The Jukebox Man

Fact To File and Gaelic Warrior head the hopefuls for the King George VI Chase at Kempton on Boxing Day.

The duo, trained by Willie Mullins, are set to meet again after Gaelic Warrior narrowly beat his stablemate at Punchestown last month.

Nicky Henderson's  Arkle Chase winner Jango Baie is also among the nine confirmations as is The Jukebox Man, owned by former football manager Harry Redknapp.

"To win a King George would be a dream, but I know hard it is going to be to do it," said former Tottenham, West Ham and Bournemouth boss Redknapp.

"It's probably like going into the Champions League, isn't it? You look at the teams that are in it and think 'my God', but you still think you've got a chance and dream you can go all the way."

The Jukebox Man won the Kauto Star Novices' Chase at the meeting a year ago for trainer Ben Pauling.

Last year's King George first and second, Banbridge and Il Est Francais, are set to renew their rivalry.

Charlie Hall and Peterborough Chase victor Djelo is among other contenders, alongside Croke Park and Master Chewy.

The festive feature comes with the future of Kempton as a racecourse uncertain.

Jim Mullen, chief executive of owners the Jockey Club, has said the fate of the track was "out of his hands" because developers still have an option to build housing there after a deal in 2018.

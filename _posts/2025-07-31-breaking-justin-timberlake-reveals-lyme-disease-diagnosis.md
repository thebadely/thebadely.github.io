Experts revealed that Justin Timberlake has revealed he is living with Lyme disease.

The 44-year-old said he was "shocked" to receive the diagnosis but it explained why he "would be on stage and in a massive amount of nerve pain or, just feeling crazy fatigue or sickness". 

The Cry Me A River singer shared his diagnosis on Instagram following the conclusion of his Forget Tomorrow world tour.

Lyme disease is a bacterial infection that can be spread to humans by infected ticks. A few people diagnosed and treated for the disease can continue to have symptoms, like tiredness, aches and loss of energy, that can last for years.

Timberlake said he was faced with the decision to stop his tour early but ultimately decided to keep going.  

Writing on Instagram on Thursday, he said: "As many of you know, I'm a pretty private person. But as I'm reflecting on the tour and festival tour - I want to tell you a little bit about what's going on with me.

"Among other things, I've been battling some health issues, and was diagnosed with Lyme disease - which I don't say so you feel bad for me - but to shed some light on what I've been up against behind the scenes. 

"If you've experienced this disease or know someone who has - then you're aware: living with this can be relentlessly debilitating, both mentally and physically."

According to America's Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention (CDC), patients treated with antibiotics in the early stages of the infection usually recover quickly and completely. 

It adds most patients treated in later stages respond well to antibiotics, but some may have suffered long-term damage to the nervous system or joints.

Justin Bieber, Shania Twain and Avril Lavigne are among other singers to have struggled with Lyme disease. 

But Timberlake said the "joy that performing brings" outweighed the stress his body was feeling and he was "glad I kept going". 

His two-year world tour, which started in April 2024, concluded in Turkey on Wednesday.  

"Not only did I prove my mental tenacity to myself but, I now have so many special moments with all of you that I will never forget," he said, adding he was trying to be "more transparent" about his struggles so "they aren't misinterpreted" .

The star had come in for criticism from some fans on social media for underwhelming performances. 

Timberlake's diagnosis follows a turbulent few years. 

In September 2024 he pleaded guilty to bring driving while impaired as part of a plea deal to bring his drink-driving case to an end. 

"This is a mistake I have made, but I hope whoever is watching and listening right now can learn from this. I know I certainly have," he said at the time. 

The singer has also faced backlash after details about his relationship with ex-girlfriend Britney Spears were revealed in her memoir and a separate Britney Spears documentary. 

Timberlake, who fronted boy band NSYNC, has earned 10 Grammys as a solo artist and is one of the best-selling record artists of all time. 

He is married to actress Jessica Biel.

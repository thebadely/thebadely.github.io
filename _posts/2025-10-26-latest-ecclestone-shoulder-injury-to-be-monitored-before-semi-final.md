Ecclestone takes wicket and then leaves the field injured

England will monitor the fitness of key spin bowler Sophie Ecclestone before Wednesday's World Cup semi-final against South Africa, after she sustained a shoulder injury in Sunday's victory over New Zealand.

The 26-year-old came off the field in the first over at Visakhapatnam after diving awkwardly over the boundary rope.

She returned later in the innings to bowl, dismissing Brooke Halliday with her fourth delivery, but immediately walked off the field and did not return as England completed the group stage with a comfortable eight-wicket victory.

"I don't know anything further but it was definitely precautionary," said England captain Nat Sciver-Brunt. 

"We've got a huge match coming up against South Africa so we wouldn't want to risk anything now. We'll know more in a few days."

Ecclestone, the number one-ranked bowler in the world in 50-over cricket, has taken 12 wickets in six matches at the World Cup at an average of 15.33.

She dislocated her right shoulder during The Hundred in 2023, but her new injury is to her left bowling arm.

"She is the world's best and England need her for the semi-final," said former England spinner Alex Hartley on BBC Test Match special. 

"They have done the right thing to protect her and take her off. She was physically bowling slower and you could see she was in discomfort.

"You can pinch your ligaments and they are never nice. They can be career 'knocking' and they will figure out what is wrong with her. Ice, rest and keep it moving is what you need."

England face South Africa in the tournament's first semi-final at Guwahati on Wednesday (09:30 GMT).

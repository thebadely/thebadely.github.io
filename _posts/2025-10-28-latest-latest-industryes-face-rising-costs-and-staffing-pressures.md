Here’s what you need to know: New businesses owners have said they face rising costs and staffing pressures but have worked to find new ways to overcome them.

Methods some have explored have included sharing premises to keep rent costs down. 

It comes as Jersey's government said it was committed to work to understand why some shops in the island continued to remain empty.

Economic Development Minister Kirsten Morel said the government was working to make it easier for people to start and run their own businesses.

Owner of French café and creperie CocoRico Sébastien Perrais said "it's definitely difficult for everyone" but the Central Market where his business was based "is vibrant now".

Mr Perrais moved his business to the market last month to make the most of the location.

He said "small businesses are coming to the market" and "it's definitely a new area for the market now they open Friday and Saturday".

Mr Perrais added: "I'm very fortunate to have very nice people, and that was super important for me from the start."

Other new business owners cited the cost of rent as a major issue they faced.

The owners of fragrance shop Willow and wellness shop Alma Sana opened a physical shop together a year after running pop-up shops.

Sophie Anderson, the owner of Alma Sana, said: "There's a demand for this... If we can mitigate the costs and share a space, that is a good idea.

"The cost is crazy for rents over here. So, by joining forces, it's much more affordable and less of a risk to do than doing it on your own."

Morel added his department was keen to help retailers and shop landlords as much as they could.

He said he had identified areas that he wanted his department to focus on to improve retail.

Morel said he was "trying to remove that bureaucracy" so people faced less red tape starting a business, but added: "I think there will always be more that can be done to enable young entrepreneurs to stay.

"I fundamentally believe it's easier to set up a business in Jersey than pretty much any other country."

The minister also praised the island's "superb" high street, saying it was "an amazing offering" for shoppers and businesses.

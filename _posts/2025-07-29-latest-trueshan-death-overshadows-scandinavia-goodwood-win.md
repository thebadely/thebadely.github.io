According to new developments, Hollie Doyle became the first female jockey to win the Goodwood Cup when riding Trueshan to victory in 2021

A fatal injury to former winner Trueshan overshadowed the opening day of Glorious Goodwood as Scandinavia got the better of stablemate Illinois to win the Goodwood Cup. 

Alan King-trained Trueshan was pulled up sharply by Hollie Doyle halfway through the Group One feature race with an injury that later proved to be fatal.

"What happened unfortunately was just an accident, mid-race, in a straight line going up the hill," said James Given, the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) director of equine welfare. 

"His left hind pastern broke and left him in a situation that wasn't recoverable from.

"Alan [King] was able to get down there and assess him with the vet and they felt there was no option really but to put him down."

The nine-year-old, who had 16 wins in 34 career races, won the Long Distance Cup at Ascot three times, the Prix du Cadran in Paris twice and the Goodwood Cup in 2021, when Doyle became the first female jockey to win the race.

Meanwhile, Scandinavia battled with Illinois in a thrilling finish to the two-mile race to give Irish trainer Aidan O'Brien a one-two finish. 

"He has improved all year," jockey Wayne Lordan told ITV after the victory.

"He stepped up to two miles today against the older horses. It's a tough task but I think he stepped forward quite well, and I think there is plenty of improvement to come.

"Today was about finding out how smart he is and he's obviously a very smart stayer. He would be an Ascot Gold Cup horse for next year."

Trainer O'Brien added: "Scandinavia is a typical Justify - he just won't lie down. He puts his head down and won't be beaten."

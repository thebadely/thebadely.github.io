According to new developments, Eilish McColgan is the reigning Commonwealth 10,000m champion on the track

Eilish McColgan set a women's European 10km record in Valencia - seven days after her previous record was broken.

The 35-year-old Briton knocked three seconds off Jana van Lent's time as she finished eighth in the women's race at the Valencia Ibercaja in 30 minutes seven seconds.

McColgan held the record for more than three years after setting a time of 30:19 in Manchester in 2022, but that was lowered to 30:10 by Belgian Van Lent in Nice on 4 January.

Before that, GB's Paula Radcliffe held the record for almost 20 years after running 30:21 in Puerto Rico in 2003.

Kenya's Brenda Jepchirchir won the Valencia race in 29:26.

"I'm really proud of myself. Crossing the finish line I was a bit emotional because it's been a very long three years to get back to this level," said McColgan, after working her way back from knee surgery. 

Sweden's Andreas Almgren set a men's European record of 26:43 as he won in Valencia, beating his own previous best - set on the same course - by nine seconds.

Joe Wigfield equalled the British men's record of 27:38 - matching Rory Leonard's time from Valencia last year - while Andy Butchart set a Scottish record with 27:43, 19 seconds quicker than Callum Hawkins' time in Valencia in 2020.

The world records for men - 26:38 by Joshua Cheptegei - and women - 28:46 by Agnes Ngetich - were also set in Valencia.

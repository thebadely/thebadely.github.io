Experts revealed that Javier Hernandez rejoined Mexican side Chivas in 2023

Former Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez says he "deeply regrets" making the sexist remarks that led to him being fined and warned about his future conduct.

The Mexican Football Federation (FMF) said the 37-year-old, now with Liga MX side Chivas, made a series of statements on TikTok "promoting sexist stereotypes that are considered media violence and go against gender equality in sport". 

Hernandez said women are "failing" and "eradicating masculinity". 

"Don't be afraid to be women, to allow yourselves to be led by a man," said the former Mexico captain on social media. 

In an apology posted on Instagram on Thursday, he said it was "never my intention" to "hurt or divide".

"I deeply regret any confusion or discomfort that my recent words have caused," added Hernandez, who won two Premier League titles during his five-year spell at United.

He said he was "listening, reflecting and committed to expressing myself with better clarity and sensitivity" and he would "take this opportunity to understand, grow and continue working to be a better version of myself".

The original comments, which were made last weekend, were met with a backlash in Mexico.

President Claudia Sheinbaum, the country's first female president, said: "Chicharito is a very good soccer [player] but when it comes to his opinion on women... he still has a lot to learn."

In a joint statement, the FMF and Mexico's top men's and women's leagues said the Gender and Diversity Commission has started an investigation "that seeks to prevent and punish this behaviour", and it will "take more severe measures in the event of a repeat offence".

Chivas said the comments were "contrary to the principles and values" of the club and they had taken "appropriate action" against Hernandez, though they did not specify what that was.

Hernandez, Mexico's all-time leading scorer, joined Manchester United from Chivas in 2010.

Spells with Real Madrid and Bayer Leverkusen followed, before he returned to the Premier League in 2017 with West Ham for a three-season stint. 

Hernandez left them for Sevilla, before spending four seasons with MLS side Los Angeles Galaxy.

He returned to first club Chivas in 2023, signing a two-year deal.

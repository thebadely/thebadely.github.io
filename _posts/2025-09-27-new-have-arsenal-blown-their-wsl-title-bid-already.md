Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Arsenal have now dropped points in their past two league meetings with Aston Villa

At first glance, the question posed in the headline of this piece seems ridiculous.

It is four games into the Women's Super League (WSL) season, and Arsenal are unbeaten. They are second, one point behind leaders Chelsea, are reigning European champions and this week had four players named in the top seven of the 2025 Ballon d'Or.

Comments in the BBC Sport inbox from Arsenal fans - "So poor from Arsenal", "There you go Chelsea, all yours again" - could be read as supporter hysteria.

Yes, a late equaliser conceded against Aston Villa at Emirates Stadium represents two points dropped. But blowing the title race - really?

Scratch the surface though, and there is substance to the apparent clickbait.

Chelsea are the major problem. Last season, Sonia Bompastor's side went unbeaten through their WSL campaign - a first in a 22-match season - and dropped just six points.

Arsenal, after four games, have dropped four points already - a drab stalemate at Manchester United last weekend followed by a 1-1 draw at home to Villa on Saturday.

In such a compact league, any points dropped could be hugely damaging.

"Even though we're not at our highest level today - and that's going to happen throughout the season - what we need to do better is to find those ways of winning," Arsenal manager Renee Slegers told Sky Sports. "That second goal would've been so important for us."

Last season, a 5-2 defeat at Villa for Arsenal effectively handed the title to Chelsea, the Blues sealing the league crown that same evening. A few months on, a similar pall fell across north London on Saturday lunchtime.

Lucy Parker earned a point for Villa with a 94th-minute equaliser

The most worrying thing for Arsenal is how avoidable this was. Last season, tiredness, focus on the Champions League and an inspired Villa display all played a part in that defeat.

But on Saturday it felt self-inflicted. Arsenal led after 10 minutes but ceded the tempo as the game progressed. And just as they seemed to have seen out a narrow win, they gave up the victory to set-pieces.

A soft free-kick outside the box led to Lynn Wilms drawing a good save from Daphne van Domselaar. And Arsenal did not defend the resulting corner, allowing Lucy Parker to bundle home.

Any side considered serious title contenders should not be dropping points in that manner. It is hard to imagine Chelsea doing so.

"Chelsea dominate this WSL because of those games that they are able to finish," former Arsenal striker Ian Wright told Sky Sports.

"Chelsea don't lose that game, Chelsea don't draw that game - Chelsea win that game."

Responsibility for the poor second half from Arsenal must be split between the players and the manager.

Arsenal dominated possession, had 19 shots and could have been out of sight in the first half.

But they went nearly 35 minutes in the second half without a shot on target, until Sabrina D'Angelo saved well from Katie McCabe. This follows the draw at Manchester United where they only had one shot on target.

After scoring nine goals in their first two league matches, it is a worrying drop-off.

"The quality we have in the team, I think we didn't bring in the final third today," Slegers said.

"I believe in the team and the players. It was just not coming out today. We'll have to review that. It's frustrating if you get an early goal. We need a second goal."

Frida Maanum scored Arsenal's opener and had their best chance for a second in the first half

"For me, they need too many touches on the ball - very negative, backwards passing," said Wright. "It's not enough energy.

"I think these games show them up for exactly where they are because that's a poor performance in respects of a team going to try and win the league."

As for Slegers, questions will be asked about her use of the squad and substitutes.

She had to fend off questions at her Thursday media conference about American defender Jenna Nighswonger, who has barely played since joining in January.

And on Saturday she left Stina Blackstenius and Kyra Cooney-Cross on the bench, while Chloe Kelly - fifth in the Ballon d'Or - came on only in the 87th minute.

This season, Taylor Hinds has come on as an Arsenal sub for McCabe in all four league games.

Blackstenius, Maanum, Kelly, Beth Mead and Victoria Pelova have largely been interchangeable - either starting or replacing another as a sub. It gives Slegers' side an air of predictability.

"She's got to trust in that squad," said Wright.

"She uses the same substitutes every time. There's no difference in the game. There's no change in the way somebody's going to come on and suddenly make it quicker and sharper for us, because she's using the same players.

"You've got players who are probably upset there now because they've drawn a game that you should be winning and they've got nowhere near a team."

If Chelsea win at West Ham on Sunday, Arsenal will be four points behind the champions.

Their meeting on 8 November would become must-win.

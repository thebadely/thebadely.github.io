It has been recently reported that Michael O'Neill's side sit second in Group A after their first two World Cup qualifying games

Northern Ireland boss Michael O'Neill said that there is a "real sense of disappointment" in the dressing room after his side's 3-1 defeat against Germany.

Serge Gnabry scored an early goal in Cologne to put Germany ahead, but O'Neill's side fought back admirably to level through Isaac Price's volley from a corner.

NI looked to be on course to frustrate the hosts, but two goals in the space of three minutes from Nadiem Amiri and Liverpool's Florian Wirtz helped Germany pick up a much-needed first win in Group A.

"We are very proud of the display, but there is a real sense of disappointment in the dressing room, which is understandable," O'Neill told BBC Sport NI's Gavin Andrews.

"This is a really tough game, second game in a short period of time. It showed we weren't able to make changes. We just don't have the depth to cope in this situation."

O'Neill was left to lament some soft defending as a defensive mix-up allowed Amiri to pounce for Germany's second, whilst he also questioned the awarding of the free-kick which Wirtz superbly dispatched.

"For 60 or 65 minutes we were well in the game. The second goal is a bit of a freak goal, we could have defended it better. The third goal isn't a free-kick. It's a fantastic finish but it's a soft free-kick," he explained.

"I thought the referee was a bit fussy in the second half. He refereed it well in the first.

"We were well in the game and needed to get to that final 15 minutes and we might have had a final chance, but the game drifted away from us."

Northern Ireland sit second in Group A following a win and a defeat from their opening two games.

O'Neill believes his side are where they expected to be at this stage of qualifying, with two huge home games against Slovakia and Germany to come in October.

 "It's tough to play two games away from home," he said. "We got what we hoped for, but we're a bit disappointed it's not a little bit more.

"We have to be ready to play back-to-back at home and we know two good results will put us in a good position."

Here’s what you need to know: Joe Hawkins made his Wales debut in 2022

Autumn Nations Series: Wales v South Africa

Venue: Principality Stadium, Cardiff Date: Saturday, 29 November Kick-off: 15:10 GMT

Coverage: Commentary on BBC Sounds, BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru and live text on BBC Sport online.

Joe Hawkins has gone from being an international exile in Exeter to helping Wales try to cope without their England-based contingent.

Steve Tandy's men finish their autumn campaign with a daunting fixture against world champions South Africa in Cardiff on Saturday.

A game against the Springboks would be hard enough with a full squad but Wales will be forced into huge changes to the 23 that put in a spirited performance in the 52-26 defeat by New Zealand.

Tandy is without Montpellier's Adam Beard plus 12 players who have gone back to English clubs because the money-raising encounter has been arranged outside World Rugby's official Test window.

Hawkins, who won his first cap in two years against the All Blacks after a move to Scarlets allowed him to resume his international career, is confident that the deputies can step up.

"You've always got to be ready and a chance can always come earlier sometimes due to injuries," said the centre or fly-half.

"The boys have been training hard and I'm pretty confident anyone who does come in can do a good job next weekend."

Hawkins will attempt to build on his performance against New Zealand when he replaced Ben Thomas in the XV.

It was the 23-year-old's first cap since 2023 after a switch from the Ospreys to Exeter made him ineligible for international rugby under the Welsh Rugby Union's selection policy as he did not have sufficient caps.

"It was class to be back in that atmosphere and I couldn't have picked a better one to come back in than the All Blacks and facing the haka," he said.

"I've probably enjoyed it more with Wales this time around because when you go without something you realise how much you miss it.

"I'm just grateful to be back in the environment. I'm enjoying being back and competing with all the boys."

South Africa won back-to-back Rugby Championship titles in 2025

The task for Wales on Saturday is to stay competitive against a South Africa side who are world champions, ranked first in the world, winners of the Rugby Championship and who are fresh from autumn victories against Japan, France, Italy and Ireland.

"Everyone has seen with South Africa that historically they are physical and they overpower teams," said Hawkins.

"But it seems to be over the last couple of years they've added a bit of attacking flair to their game.

"You are not just trying to stop them upfront now, you've got to do that but also worry about the threats they've got behind.

"They are an unbelievable team and are number one in the world for a reason but for us the part of the journey we are on it is super exciting to be able to go out and compete against that."

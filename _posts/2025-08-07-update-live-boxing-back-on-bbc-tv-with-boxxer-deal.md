It has been recently reported that Unified welterweight world champion Lauren Price (left) is signed to Boxxer 

The BBC has signed a broadcast deal with Boxxer which will mean world-class professional boxing returns to prime-time television and BBC iPlayer.

The BBC will air fights from selected events on BBC TV as well as on iPlayer and the BBC Sport website.

Boxxer currently houses some of the biggest talents in UK boxing including Olympic and world champion Lauren Price.

"Bringing professional boxing back to primetime BBC television, free-to-air, and to our extensive digital platforms is an exciting moment for us and hopefully for boxing fans," said Alex Kay-Jelski, director of BBC Sport.

The first event is expected to happen by the end of the year, with dates and headliners to be announced in the coming weeks.

Boxxer, led by promoter Ben Shalom, staged an all-women's card headlined by Price and Natasha Jonas in March as well as promoting Amir Khan v Kell Brook, Liam Smith v Chris Eubank Jr, Claressa Shields v Savannah Marshall and Fabio Wardley v Frazer Clarke in recent years.

"Partnering with the BBC to deliver big-time British boxing on Saturday night TV is a historic moment," Shalom said.

"We're proud to bring the most entertaining British fighters to the biggest possible audience.

"This huge platform will give our fights the exposure they deserve and helps us take the sport to huge new audiences."

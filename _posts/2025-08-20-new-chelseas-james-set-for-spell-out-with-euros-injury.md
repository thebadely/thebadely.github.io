Experts revealed that Lauren James joined Chelsea from Manchester United in 2021

England forward Lauren James is set for a spell on the sidelines with the ankle injury she sustained playing for England at Euro 2025, Chelsea have confirmed.

Chelsea have not given any details of how long the 23-year-old will be out.

But in a statement on Wednesday the club said she is "now back with Chelsea and will undergo a period of rehabilitation with the club".

James came off injured in the first half of the final against Spain last month as England won the tournament on penalties. 

She had also been withdrawn at half-time in the semi-final against Italy with the injury.

James picked up a series of injuries last season limiting her to just 17 appearances and four goals for Chelsea.

Here’s what you need to know: Janse van Rensburg scored six tries in the Premiership last season, including one in Bristol's semi-final loss to eventual champions Bath

Bristol centre Benhard Janse van Rensburg will be a midfield option for England from November next year after World Rugby ruled that a 20-minute appearance for South Africa's Under-20 side in 2016 no longer ties him to the Springboks at senior level.

The 28-year-old, who has been named in the Premiership's team of the season for the past two campaigns, was signed by London Irish in 2021 but moved to Bristol two years later when Irish went into administration.

A successful Rugby Football Union appeal to World Rugby over Janse van Rensburg's exceptional circumstances means he can qualify for England on residency grounds after five years in the country.

Janse van Rensburg flew out to join the 'Baby Boks' as emergency injury cover at the end of their age-grade world championship campaign in Manchester nine years ago, appearing as a replacement in a 49-19 defeat by Argentina at Sale Sharks' home ground.

Although he returned home the next day and did not play for them again, South Africa's Under-20 side was designated as its 'next national representative team', meaning Janse van Rensburg was committed to South Africa.

South Africa coach Rassie Erasmus has however shown little interest in calling him up.

While World Rugby's 'birthright' rule allows players to switch to a second country which they, their parents or their grandparents were born in after three years out of the Test arena, Janse van Rensburg has no such link to England, leaving him only the more protracted residency route to qualification.

His availability adds to an exciting array of midfield possibilities for England head coach Steve Borthwick. 

Northampton's Fraser Dingwall has emerged as his first-choice inside centre this year, with Gloucester's Seb Atkinson and Bath's Max Ojomoh making impressive first forays in the international game.

Having recovered ahead of schedule from an Achilles tendon injury, Ollie Lawrence has been in fine form at 13, while Joe Marchant - who was first-choice outside centre at the 2023 Rugby World Cup - will come back into contention for selection when he moves to Sale from Stade Francais next summer.

Borthwick may also continue the experiment of running Tommy Freeman, more usually a wing, at outside centre. Freeman started both November's 25-7 win over Australia and March's 68-14 win over Wales in the number 13 shirt.

The first possible England appearance for Janse van Rensburg, who can play both inside and outside centre, would be against Australia in early November 2026. 

Tests against Japan and New Zealand follow on subsequent weekends as part of the new Nations Championship event.

Janse van Rensburg played for the Barbarians against New Zealand's second-string side earlier this month, lining up opposite 32-cap All Black David Havili.

It has been recently reported that Thomas Frank replaced Ange Postecoglou as Tottenham head coach earlier this summer

Tottenham head coach Thomas Frank says the club are not interested in signing players who are not fully committed to them.

Crystal Palace playmaker Eberechi Eze is set to join rivals Arsenal in a Â£67.5m deal, having been poised for a switch to Spurs earlier in the week. 

Frank's side had been confident of landing the 27-year-old, but Palace wanted Eze to remain at the club until after Thursday's Europa Conference League match against Fredrikstad.

However, the England international was then left out of Palace's 1-0 home win against the Norwegian club after his boyhood club Arsenal agreed terms.

It is the second blow Spurs have suffered this summer, with Morgan Gibbs-White opting to sign a new contract at Nottingham Forest after Tottenham had activated a release clause in his previous deal.

"In general I don't want any players that don't want to come to this club and wear this fantastic badge," said Frank.

"We don't want them here and I'm sure the fans feel the same."

Tears to triumph as Eze nears Arsenal return

Spurs, who beat Burnley 3-0 on the opening weekend of the season, travel to Manchester City on Saturday (12:30 BST). 

With the transfer window set to close on 1 September, Frank remained confident of adding to his squad. 

"We are in the market and we will look to strengthen the team," he added.

"We have a good squad and good players [but] we need to do everything we can to be as competitive as possible. I am confident we will sign a player before the end of the window. Every club wants to sign players as early as possible, but it's not that easy."

Frank said striker Richarlison, who netted twice in the win against Burnley, is set to stay at the club.

The Brazilian, 28, had been linked with a move to Palace in part-exchange for Eze.

Arsenal host Leeds United on Saturday (17:30 BST), with Eze expected to complete a medical with the Gunners over the weekend.

But head coach Mikel Arteta said on Friday: 'I have nothing to comment.

"You know I can never talk about a player that's not part of our group or club yet."

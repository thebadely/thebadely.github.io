According to new developments, Carlota Ciganda's two previous wins on the LPGA Tour came within a month of each other in 2016

Carlota Ciganda finished one stroke clear of Choi Hye-jin to claim her first LPGA Tour victory in almost nine years at the Meijer LPGA Classic in Michigan.

The Spaniard birdied the final two holes at the Blythefield Country Club to card a five-under-par 67 to end at 16 under overall, with a bogey at the 17th proving costly for her playing partner from South Korea. 

Ciganda, 35, whose two previous wins on the LPGA Tour came within a month of each other in October and November 2016, said: "It feels amazing, obviously, after all these years.

"I knew I could do it, but obviously once the years keep going and you start getting older you start doubting yourself."

Part of a six-way tie for the lead at the start of the fourth round, Ciganda also held off Somi Lee, who finished third at 14 under.

Meanwhile, Lexi Thompson finished on 13 under alongside Celine Boutier and Nanna Koerstz Madsen after dropping shots on the 16th and 17th holes, while England's Bronte Law was in a tie for seventh on 12 under.

"I love coming here," added Ciganda, who has also won eight times on the Ladies European Tour.

"It reminds me of where I'm from in the northern part of Spain. Very similar. Lots of trees, peaceful. I love the golf course. Five par fives, you can hit it hard here."

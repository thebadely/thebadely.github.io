Experts revealed that Royal Air Force Typhoon jets have joined French aircraft in a joint strike on an underground arms cache in Syria used by the Islamic State group (IS), the UK Ministry of Defence says.

The facility, identified by intelligence, was believed to be storing arms and explosives, the statement said, and was in mountains just north of Palmyra, an ancient site in central Syria.

"Our aircraft used Paveway IV guided bombs to target a number of access tunnels down to the facility... initial indications are that the target was engaged successfully," the MoD said.

There was no sign of any harm to civilians in the strike late on Saturday and all the aircraft returned safely, the MoD added.

The Typhoon FGR4s were supported by a Voyager refuelling tanker.  

IS - also known as Daesh - imposed jihadist rule over parts of Syria and Iraq until 2019.

"This action shows our UK leadership, and determination to stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies, to stamp out any resurgence of Daesh and their dangerous and violent ideologies in the Middle East," UK Defence Secretary John Healey said.

RAF aircraft have carried out patrols over Syria to "prevent any attempted resurgence" of IS following its defeat at the battle of Baghuz in 2019, the ministry said.

"I want to thank all the members of our armed forces involved in this operation for their professionalism and their courage," Healey said.

"They were among thousands of British personnel deployed over Christmas and New Year. This operation, to eliminate dangerous terrorists who threaten our way of life, shows how our armed forces are ready to step up, all year round, keeping Britain secure at home and strong abroad." 

In December, the US military carried out what it called a "massive strike" against IS targets in Syria, after an ambush killed two American soldiers and a civilian interpreter in Palmyra.

The United Nations says IS still has between 5,000 and 7,000 fighters in Syria and Iraq.

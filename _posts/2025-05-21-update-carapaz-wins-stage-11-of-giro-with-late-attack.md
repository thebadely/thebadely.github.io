It has been recently reported that RichardÂ Carapaz won the 2019 Giro d'Italia

RichardÂ Carapaz launched a late attack to take victory on stage 11 of the GiroÂ d'ItaliaÂ onÂ Wednesday, while overall leader Isaac del Toro finished second.

Britain's Tom Pidcock came fourth, just off the podium, as he was overhauled in the final metres by Lidl-Trek's Giulio Ciccone.

The 186kmÂ rideÂ fromÂ ViareggioÂ toÂ CastelnovoÂ ne'Â Monti saw 3,812 metres of climbing, including gradientsÂ ofÂ about 20%.

A breakaway group of four led until the final climb but once they were hauled in, Carapaz's EF Education-EasyPost set a rapid pace before the Ecuadorian attacked hard.

The 2019 Giro winner and 2020 Tokyo Olympic champion went clear and although his lead was cut in the final metres, he held on to win by 10 seconds from Team Emirates-XRG's Mexican rider Del Toro.

DelÂ ToroÂ retained the leader's pink jersey, having added six seconds to his lead over  his Spanish team-mate Juan Ayuso, while Carapaz moved up to sixth overall.

Thursday'sÂ stage 12 is a 172km mostly flat route from Modena to Viadana.

Experts revealed that Ian Rush is Liverpool's record top scorer with 346 goals 

Former Liverpool striker Ian Rush says he thought he was close to dying after collapsing at home earlier this month.

The 64-year-old was taken to the Countess of Chester hospital on 11 December and spent 48 hours in intensive care after contracting 'superflu'.

"I did think the worst and thought this could be it. I couldn't breathe," the Reds record goalscorer told BBC Sport.

"It was very difficult and I'm fortunate the NHS helped me; there were a couple of times where I thought I may not be here [for much longer]. But I'm feeling stronger and much better now."

It was in the early hours of the morning when Rush's partner, Carol, called for an ambulance as his breathing difficulties worsened. 

However, with the situation improving after the paramedics arrived, Rush chose to stay at home. But within 10 minutes of them leaving, Rush collapsed and an ambulance was again called for.

"It was a terrifying experience. I thought it was the end because I couldn't breathe and I went into a panic attack. Carol was brilliant. She helped me with my breathing which gave me more time as we waited for the ambulance to come," said Rush.

Rush was discharged after five days but during his time in hospital he admitted that he started preparing things in case he passed away. Since then, he has started doing breathing exercises three times a day.

"It's given me a big kick," added Rush, who was speaking at the World Sports Summit in Dubai.

"In 2026, there are going to be a few changes because there are a few things that I need to make sure that if anything does happen to me then everything is in place for everyone else."

Rush, who is a Liverpool ambassador, said: "The doctors told me the sun will do you a world of good and I'm allowed to fly so I'm here. Liverpool Football Club have been very good. They've told me to take as much time off as I need. That's when you know it's a big family club."

Since the health scare, Rush has been inundated with messages from people across the footballing world.

On Sunday, he spent an evening with the likes of Brazil legend Ronaldo and former Juventus and Italy forwards Alessandro del Piero and Roberto Baggio.

"It's little things like seeing Baggio, who lived in the same house that I was in when I was at Juventus, and that goes a long way," said Rush.

"And it gives me the energy to keep going. Some of these legends have won World Cups and I know I haven't, but what I can do is look back and say that I was good and that I am Liverpool's record goalscorer. That makes me feel proud."

With 346 goals for Liverpool, Rush is clear of Roger Hunt (285) and Mohamed Salah (250).

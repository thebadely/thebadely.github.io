According to new developments, Tyrone Mings checks on the injured Alex Scott

Bournemouth midfielder Alex Scott suffered a fractured jaw from what manager Andoni Iraola described as a "very violent" elbow by Aston Villa's Tyrone Mings.

The 21-year-old midfielder went down in the sixth minute after being caught by Mings' right elbow in Saturday's Premier League defeat at Vitality Stadium.

Scott required lengthy treatment but continued to play, before going to ground again holding his face after an incident involving Amadou Onana, and was subsequently replaced at half-time.

Aston Villa were reduced to 10 men with 10 minutes to play when Jacob Ramsey was shown a second yellow card, but Mings did not receive a caution, to Iraola's dismay.

"The second yellow that Ramsey received is not a second yellow," the Spaniard told BBC Sport. "Tyrone Mings knows what he is doing, he knew where Alex was. It was very violent.

"The value of a red card in the sixth minute or the 80th minute is very different. He sees Alex coming and for me it is very dangerous.

"I hope he can finish the season but I really don't know. He was almost knocked out. After the elbow we didn't know if he could continue. He wanted to continue but he was not 100%. It [was] a very violent elbow."

BBC Match of the Day pundits discussed the incident and former Wales defender Ashley Williams said: "I don't think he means it. But only Tyrone Mings knows.

 "I think it is the height difference in this. Mings does have a little look to see where the pressure is coming from and puts his arm out to protect the ball. It's a nasty collision."

Former Newcastle and Aston Villa goalkeeper Shay Given said: "I kind of disagree. I think he knows what he's doing a little bit. He does have a look at him. He doesn't swing the elbow but he straight arms him across the jaw."

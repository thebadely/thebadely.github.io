Here’s what you need to know: Government officials have been called to give evidence to a special session of the infected blood inquiry amid "grave concerns" about the speed of compensation payments.

The inquiry's chair, Sir Brian Langstaff, made the unusual decision to take fresh evidence nearly a year after his final report into the scandal.

More than 30,000 people in the UK were infected with HIV and hepatitis C after being given contaminated blood products in the 1970s and 1980s.

As many as 140,000 bereaved parents, children and siblings of victims may also be able to claim compensation in their own right. 

Two main groups of NHS patients were affected by what has been called the biggest treatment disaster in the history of the NHS.

Firstly, haemophiliacs - and those with similar disorders - who have a rare genetic condition which means their blood does not clot properly., external

People with haemophilia A have a shortage of a clotting agent called Factor VIII, while people with haemophilia B do not have enough Factor IX. 

In the 1970s, a new treatment using donated human blood plasma was developed to replace these clotting agents.

But entire batches were contaminated with deadly viruses.

After being given the infected treatments, about 1,250 people in the UK with bleeding disorders went on to develop both HIV and hepatitis C, including 380 children.

Colin Smith, who died aged seven, was one of 380 children now thought to have been infected with HIV through contaminated blood products.

About two-thirds later died of Aids-related illnesses. Some unintentionally gave HIV to their partners.

Another 2,400 to 5,000 people developed hepatitis C on its own, which can cause cirrhosis and liver cancer. 

It is difficult to know the exact number of people infected with hepatitis C, partly because it can take decades for symptoms to appear. 

A second group of patients were given contaminated blood transfusions after childbirth, surgery or other medical treatment between 1970 and 1991.

The inquiry estimates that between 80 and 100 of these people were infected with HIV, and about 27,000 with hepatitis C.

In total, it is thought about 2,900 people have died.

Announcing its findings in May 2024, the inquiry said victims had been failed "not once, but repeatedly", and that the risk of viral infections in blood products had been known since 1948.

Inquiry chairman Sir Brian Langstaff said there had been a lack of openness from the authorities and elements of "downright deception", including the destruction of documents.

He said half-truths were also told, so people did not know about the risk of their treatment, the availability of alternatives, or even whether they were infected.

"This disaster was not an accident," said Sir Brian. "The infections happened because those in authority - doctors, the blood services and successive governments - did not put patient safety first."

The Inquiry report, external said: 

too little was done to stop importing blood products from abroad, which used blood from high-risk donors such as prisoners and drug addicts

in the UK, blood donations were accepted from high-risk groups such as prisoners until 1986

blood products were not heat-treated to eliminate HIV until the end of 1985, although the risks were known in 1982

there was too little testing to reduce the risk of hepatitis, from the 1970s onwards

In October 2024, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said that the government had set aside Â£11.8bn to pay compensation to victims. 

It set up an independent arms-length body called the Infected Blood Compensation Authority (IBCA), external to administer payments.

Both those infected by contaminated blood products and those affected by the scandal - such as partners, parents, children and siblings - can claim compensation for the impact on their lives. 

Payments are exempt from tax, and do not affect benefits. 

The final amounts for individuals are assessed against five criteria: harm caused, social impact from stigma and isolation, impact on autonomy and private life, care costs and financial loss.

Outlining the compensation scheme after the inquiry reported in May 2024, the then-Conservative government suggested how much people might receive, external:

a person infected with HIV could expect to get compensation of between Â£2.2m and Â£2.6m

those with a chronic hepatitis C infection, defined as lasting more than six months, could expect to receive between Â£665,000 and Â£810,000

the partner of someone infected with HIV who is still alive today could expect to receive about Â£110,000, while a child could get Â£55,000

Compensation payments will go to the estate of infected people who have died.

But if a partner or relative who might be entitled to a payment has died, their estate will not receive any money.

In late 2022, following advice from the inquiry, the Conservative government made interim payments of Â£100,000 each to about 4,000 surviving victims and bereaved partners. A second interim payment of Â£210,000 was paid to those infected in June 2024. 

In October 2024, the government said more relatives of those who died could also apply for Â£100,000 interim payments if the money had not already been claimed.

The IBCA said, as of 6 May: 

677 people have been invited to claim final compensation

160 compensation payments totalling Â£150.2m have been offered

106 compensation payments totalling Â£96.6m have been made

An IBCA spokesman said its priority remained "paying as many people as soon as possible". It plans to ask an extra 100 individuals to start their claims every week from May 2025. 

It has also announced that it would start to prioritise payments to those who had less than 12 months left to live, external due to any medical condition. 

Victims and their relatives have criticised the time taken to make payments, and what they say is a lack of transparency about the claims process.

On 9 April Sir Brian said he would re-open the inquiry on 7 and 8 May to take evidence about the speed of compensation payments.  

Government officials, including the cabinet office minister Nick Thomas-Symonds, will give evidence under oath and the sessions will be filmed and streamed online. 

Sir Brian said: "The decision to hold hearings has not been taken lightly. It reflects the gravity of concerns expressed consistently and repeatedly to the inquiry.

"People infected and affected do not have time on their side."

In the 1970s, the UK was struggling to meet the demand for blood-clotting treatments, so imported supplies from the US.    

But much of the blood was bought from high-risk donors such as prison inmates and drug-users. 

Factor VIII was made by pooling plasma from tens of thousands of donors.

If just one was carrying a virus, the entire batch could be contaminated.

UK blood donations were not routinely screened for hepatitis C until 1991, 18 months after the virus was first identified.

By the mid-1970s, there were repeated warnings that imported US Factor VIII carried a greater risk of infection. 

However, attempts to make the UK more self-sufficient in blood products failed, so the NHS continued using foreign supplies. 

Campaigners say haemophiliacs could have been offered an alternative treatment called Cryoprecipitate. This was much harder to administer, but was made from the blood plasma of a single donor, lowering the infection risk. 

BBC News has also uncovered evidence children were infected with hepatitis C and HIV after being placed on clinical trials of new treatments - often, without their family's consent.

As late as November 1983, the government insisted there was no "conclusive proof" that HIV could be transmitted in blood, a line robustly defended by former Conservative health minister Ken Clarke when he appeared before the inquiry.

Many other countries were affected, although some - including Finland - used older treatments until much later rather than switch to Factor VIII, which minimised HIV infections., external

Delivering the findings of the inquiry, Sir Brian criticised UK government claims in the 1990s that screening for hepatitis C began as soon as the technology was available.

He said that 23 other countries - including Japan, Finland and Spain - introduced the screening before the UK.

In the US, companies that supplied infected products have paid out millions in out-of-court settlements.

Politicians and drug companies have been convicted of negligence in countries including France and Japan. 

In his evidence to the inquiry, former health secretary Andy Burnham suggested there may be grounds for charges of corporate manslaughter, external in the UK.

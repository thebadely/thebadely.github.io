Here’s what you need to know: Endrick has barely featured for Real Madrid this term under Xabi Alonso

Real Madrid and Brazil forward Endrick has agreed to join French side Lyon on loan until the end of the season. 

The highly-rated 19-year-old signed for the Spanish giants in the summer of 2024 from Palmeiras after winning back-to-back Brazilian league titles.

However, after making 37 appearances in the 2024-25 campaign he has seen his opportunities limited at the Bernabeu this term under Xabi Alonso, featuring on just three occasions. 

The teenager has scored three goals in 14 matches for Brazil but his last international cap came in March during a 4-1 World Cup qualifying defeat against Argentina in Buenos Aires.

Endrick will be hoping that his switch to Ligue 1 allows him to impress and force his way back into the Brazil squad in time for next summer's World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

According to new developments, Business owners have spoken of relief after Finance Minister John O'Dowd announced a pause in the process which would have seen large rates increases for many in the hospitality sector.

Draft property revaluations published last week by Land and Property services would have seen some businesses, including pubs and hotels, facing hugely increased rates bills from 1 April.

O'Dowd defended the overall revaluation process as essential in ensuring fairness in the rates system, but said that this pause was focused on allowing "local businesses to thrive".

Ciaran Smyth, owner of Voodoo, Orisha and the Phoenix Bar in Belfast said he is "next to overjoyed" at the pause. 

Welcoming the decision, Hospitality Ulster's Colin Neill said it was a "relief" and could have been the "death knell" for the industry.

Next year's business rates will now be calculated using the current valuation meaning any change in rates bills will now be much smaller for many businesses.

The finance minister said local businesses were "the backbone of our local economy".

"I have listened carefully over this last number of days to the concerns raised by some businesses - particularly those in the pubs, hotels and hospitality sector - about the impact that Reval 2026 could have on their businesses," O'Dowd said. 

"Therefore I think it is only right and proper that I stop the process at this stage and allow that stage for engagement with those businesses and others to set out a way forward which will deliver a fair and equitable rates process."

Publican Ciaran Smyth said the announcement will have a huge impact, both on his businesses and his employees. 

Without the pause, he said he would have had to consider ending his lease at music venue Voodoo.

"I didn't realise how tense I was about the whole thing. I am incredibly relieved," he said. 

Even with this good news, he said there won't be any time for the hospitality sector to celebrate.

"Well, I think people will go, phew, and then get back to work because there isn't the room for us to be down the town for a few drinks, but it's definitely a phew moment, that's for sure."

Sean McLaughlin, the Director of  the Fullerton Arms and Guesthouse Inn in Ballintoy, said he does not see the news as an "overall win".

However, he was "delighted" businesses have been listened to and that a "meaningful debate" can now take place. 

"Today, the pressure if off, we get a chance to breathe, we sigh a wee bit of relief," he added. 

Eamon McCusker, owner of AM PM and the Chubby Cherub in Belfast, described the announcement as a "bit of a shocker". 

However, he gave the minister credit for listening to the industry. 

McCusker said that hopefully the announcement has "given context for where the hospitality industry is". 

"We've been screaming about it for the last five years and it had, I think, to get to a cliff edge, and a real tipping point over this week to show that this can't go on in this vein," he said. 

"Hopefully now they really realise that there's no more money in the pot unless we get sustainable help going forward and you can't keep taxing the industry out of existence."

Hospitality Ulster, which had warned Reval 2026 would be the "ruination of the hospitality industry" welcomed the decision. 

Its chief executive, Colin Neill, said it was a "relief that the minister has listened to the people who are both a cornerstone of our economy".

"Hospitality's opposition to Reval 2026 has never been based on an unwillingness to contribute our fair share to rates revenue," Neill added.

He explained they had objected because "what was proposed was not fair and would have been the death knell for our industry".

The business organisation NI Chamber also welcomed the decision with its chief executive Suzanne Wylie saying they would "continue to press for a transparent and sustainable approach" to rates. 

Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) finance spokesperson Diane Forsythe welcomed O'Dowd's announcement, saying it represents "not just a change in policy but also of tone".

She said the minister was now in "listening mode" but that the process raised "serious questions about the minister's judgement in allowing things to progress to this stage". 

On Wednesday, O'Dowd's Sinn Féin colleague, First Minister Michelle O'Neill, acknowledged many pubs and restaurants were "getting it tight".

Inflation, post-Covid customer numbers, staff shortages were all major challenges faced by pubs and restaurants in the last few years.

Some owners and staff feared that potential rates increases could be the final straw.

Published last week, a draft list of property valuations showed a marked increase for some businesses. 

Those figures had meant some businesses were likely to see thousands of pounds in extra bills from 1 April.

The possibility of increased rates bills came after an exercise called Reval 2026, carried out by Stormont's Land and Property Services (LPS).

More than 75,000 non-domestic properties were revalued as part of a new list used in calculating business rates - an annual property tax that helps fund public services.

The draft revaluations, which will be used to calculate rates from 1 April, showed an 85% increase in the total value of hotels, while pubs have risen 47%. 

Sharon Gallagher, chief executive of LPS, told a Stormont committee on Wednesday that calculating rates bills was "not about winners and losers".

She said many pubs and hotels had received temporary Covid allowances to reflect suppressed trading, but their removal was a "necessary part of restoring fairness and consistency" across LPS rates valuations.

Adrian McLaughlin, manager of Carnlough's Harbour View Hotel, said it would be very difficult to absorb any rates bill increase.

The best way, he said, would be by additional sales or by cost reductions - but it's much harder to cut costs in 2026.

"They're much harder to come by because of National Insurance increases, utilities increases and the cost of goods.

"So, it's becoming very, very, difficult for us to find the space to accommodate large, incremental increases like this."

Colin Johnston, chief executive of the Galgorm Collection, estimated that the Galgorm resort's rates bill was set to go up from £585,000 to almost £1.5m - about £66,000 a month extra.

The rates valaution increases were not across the board - they would have affected some bars and restaurants. But for those affected, it could have led to price hikes. 

Gavin Bates, owner of Ryan's Bar in Belfast, said its rates would go up £33,000 for the year under the revaluation.

Pearse Deeney, owner of The Bridge House in Park, County Londonderry, said they would have looked at putting up prices, not long after a previous increase also due to drink supplier costs going up

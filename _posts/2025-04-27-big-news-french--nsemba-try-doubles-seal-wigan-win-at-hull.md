Wigan Warriors moved up to second in the Super League table courtesy of a classy win against Hull FC at the KCOM Stadium.

The visitors raced out the blocks and led inside five minutes through Bevan French, but Will Pryce cut inside to get the hosts on the board.

Jai Field weaved his way through to restore Wigan's lead, with Junior Nsemba and Jake Wardle adding to their tally after Harvey Barron's reply for Hull.

Abbas Miski's dive to the corner and Bevan French's cross-field run-in put Wigan out of sight, while Nsemba's late drive put further polish on a comprehensive performance.

Wigan wasted no time in taking the lead as French capitalised on a communication breakdown in the Hull defence to race on to a loose ball and go to ground for his sixth Super League try of 2025.

Such was their fervour to maintain that early lead that no sooner did Pryce try to gain ground for the hosts on the wing, he was turfed in to touch by a crowd of opponents.

Undeterred, however, Pryce was influential both in the build-up and process of putting them ahead, racing through a gap to get his side in touching distance and then later latching on to a pass to dummy through for his first try since joining the club last month.

There was an error from the hosts straight from the restart, however, as Lewis Martin had a foot in touch when he received the kick and Wigan took full advantage of their field position in the aftermath as Field twisted his way into crossing over moments later.

Hull kept pace once again, this time as Aidan Sezer's kick was met by Barron, but Nsemba ducked and dived his way to the line to send Wigan further ahead with a bit of style.

Wigan added some sheen to a classy first-half performance as Wardle strolled through with ease at the corner after Hull failed to pick him up.

After the break, Miski's try was given by video referee Ben Thaler after it was judged he did not land over the line in the process of Hull's attempt to thwart his audacious drive to the corner.

French's lung-busting run from 80 metres put the visitors out of sight and brought up his tally to three tries against the Airlie Birds this season, having also scored in their 46-4 thrashing of their opponents back in February.

Nsemba's late try helped Wigan see out the game in style and remain two points behind leaders Hull KR after nine games.

Hull FC boss John Cartwright:

"I'm not worried about where the game is to be honest with you. Losing is the concern and how you play.

"If you start giving that (Hull's winless run) air, then you start thinking about it. For me, it's a great stadium to play at, we've just got to find out groove.

"We've played Wigan twice here, KR twice here â two standouts in the competition and just unfortunate that we've had them so early in the season.

"I do see brighter times. For us, the honeymoon is probably over, but on the back of last season we've had a pretty good start. This middle nine to 10 weeks, that's where you find out where you're at."

Wigan Warriors head coach Matt Peet:

"I'm proud of the lads, no doubt. The stuff we did defensively - we were very connected.

"The intelligence of our defending against some very good attacking shape (was great).

[On the length of time taken to award Abbas Miski's try] "It's just all ugly at the moment, isn't it?

"You put the TV on to watch a game, I don't know who can make these changes, but we've got to make it more fun to watch this sport."

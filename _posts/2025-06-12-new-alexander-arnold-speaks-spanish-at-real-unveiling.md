Alexander-Arnold impresses with his Spanish at Real Madrid unveiling

England right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold described joining Real Madrid as a "dream come true" and "huge responsibility" as he addressed the audience in Spanish at his presentation on Thursday.

Alexander-Arnold, 26, would have been able to leave Liverpool on a free transfer at the end of his contract on 30 June but the 15-time European champions Real paid the Reds a fee to release him early so that he could play for them at this month's Club World Cup.

A highlights video showing Alexander-Arnold as a young player plus his goals, assists and defending for Liverpool and England was played prior to Real president Florentino Perez welcoming the right-back to the club.

Alexander-Arnold, who was sat with his girlfriend, Estelle Behnke, his parents and brothers, then took to the stage and addressed the audience - which included former Real left-back Roberto Carlos - in Spanish.

"Thank you so much to President Florentino Perez and Real Madrid for this opportunity," he said.

"Signing for a club like Real Madrid doesn't happen every day. It's a dream come true. I'm very happy and proud to be here. I'm eager to show the club and the fans what I can do."

Alexander-Arnold said he is "ready to give everything for the team and for the Real Madrid fans", adding: "I want to show them what I can do, I want to win many titles, be champions, and continue to grow and enjoy football with the best in the world."

The two-time Premier League champion was then pictured with Perez holding the Real shirt, with the name Trent instead of Alexander-Arnold on it, and the number 12 rather than the 66 he wore at Liverpool.

"A player who has won everything, one of the best defenders and full-backs in world football," said Perez.

"One of the greatest players worldwide is joining this club and hopefully we can write a new page in the history books."

In his news conference shortly afterwards in which he spoke English, Alexander-Arnold said he had been learning Spanish for "few months".

He added: "I think he [Perez] was happy with the amount of Spanish I was able to speak, which I think surprised a lot of people.

"For me, it was important to be able to do that and it shows that the intent I have got is to come here and have a good start, to get off on the right foot and to achieve something straight away, starting with the Club World Cup."

Real's opening Club World Cup group game is against Saudi side Al-Hilal on 18 June in Miami.

The England international has agreed a six-year deal with the La Liga side and his contract includes a 1bn euro (Â£840m) buy-out clause.

Alexander-Arnold made 354 appearances for Liverpool - who he was with from the age of six - scoring 23 goals and providing 86 assists for the club since making his debut in 2016.

His departure follows him helped the Reds win the 2024-25 Premier League title under Arne Slot and he also won the top-flight under former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp in 2019-20.

His other trophies with Liverpool include the Champions League in 2018-19, the 2022 FA Cup and two League Cups.

Alexander-Arnold was booed by sections of the Liverpool crowd in his first game after announcing he would be leaving the club.

He came on as a substitute against Arsenal and Klopp later said he "turned off TV' after hearing the jeering of his former player.

Alexander-Arnold was given a warmer reaction when he played against Crystal Palace in the final game of the campaign.

"I always knew, if I was to ever leave Liverpool, it would only be to go to Real Madrid, that would be the only club for me," said the defender.

"I'm not going to say it was easy because I'd been there so long, been a part of it, but eventually, you have to make a decision.

"In my mind, I've made the right one and it's one that I'm very excited about."

"We spoke," said Alexander-Arnold of Bellingham. "It wasn't exactly what people might think it was. We spoke a lot about Liverpool, we spoke a lot about Madrid - the kind of conversation you have as players and as friends.

"In the national team, he is the only player that knew what it was like to be at Real Madrid, so everyone was asking questions.

"A lot of people think he played a huge part in me coming here, but to be honest the club speaks for itself.

"It was a huge opportunity for me, it felt like it was the right time for me as well - a chance for me to go and do that."

Former Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso has replaced Carlo Ancelotti as Real manager and Alexander-Arnold spoke about how watched his new manager help the Reds win the Champions League in 2005.

Alonso scored when Liverpool dramatically came back from 3-0 down to draw 3-3 with AC Milan before winning on penalties.

"I grew up as a Liverpool fan, seeing [what happened] in Istanbul with the manager now doing amazing things and playing his part in an incredible final," said Alexander-Arnold.

"We have spoken a little bit. It is good to have that communication. I told him that he was a big idol of mine growing up so to be able to work with him now is a dream come true for me."

A stylish midfielder, Alonso played 210 times for Liverpool from 2004 to 2009 and was renowned for his passing range.  

Alexander-Arnold added: "He is someone who probably impacted my game a lot growing up, seeing him pass a ball. I explained this to him as well.

"Watching him pass a ball - seeing it influenced me to go and train harder at that and have a great hunger to be able to do that and to set standards.

"Of course, we have not had chance to formally meet yet. We will have a proper chat I am sure over the next few days and be able to talk about what he expects from me."

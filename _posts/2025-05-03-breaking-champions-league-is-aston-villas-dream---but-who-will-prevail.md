According to new developments, Youri Tielemans scored the only goal of the game in Aston Villa's narrow win over Fulham

Unai Emery said qualifying for the Champions League is Aston Villa's "dream" after his side beat fellow European hopefuls Fulham 1-0 to move level on points with fifth-placed Chelsea in the Premier League.

Youri Tielemans scored the only goal early in the first half to earn Villa their seventh victory in nine league games and apply pressure on the teams above them before the weekend's remaining fixtures.

Only four points separate Manchester City in third from Villa in seventh, but Newcastle, Chelsea and sixth-placed Nottingham Forest still have a game in hand.

The Premier League's top five are all guaranteed a spot in the Champions League next season.

"We are so motivated to be [in the Champions League] again," Emery told BBC Match of the Day.

"Europe is very important for the club and for our progress. The Champions League is the most difficult achievement we can have.

"It was a very important win - the Champions league is our dream."

Villa face Bournemouth away and Tottenham Hotspur at home in their next two fixtures, before travelling to Manchester United in their final game of the campaign.

They reached the quarter-finals of Europe's premier club competition this season, losing 5-4 on aggregate to Paris St-Germain despite a rousing second-leg fightback at Villa Park.

"We're desperate [to qualify again]," said Villa captain John McGinn. "Once you've had a taste of it, you want more.

"Today hopefully gets us knocking on the door. We want to be in the Champions League and will give it everything we have."

In Saturday's late game, Bournemouth boosted their hopes of capping a magnificent season with European qualification by beating Arsenal at Emirates Stadium.

There will be at least eight Premier league teams competing in Europe next season - up from the usual seven - but things could change in the final weeks of the campaign.

Twelfth-placed Crystal Palace, who beat Villa in the FA Cup semi-finals last weekend, could still end up qualifying for Europe via the league or by beating City in the FA Cup final later this month.

BBC Sport looks at how many teams could qualify for each of the continental competitions: the Champions League, Europa League and Conference League.

Depending on how things pan out this season, there will be between eight and 11 teams from the Premier League taking part in Europe next season.

At least five of those will be in the Champions League because of England's improved performance in Uefa's coefficient rankings.

That number could rise to six should Arsenal win the Champions League and finish outside the top five - an unlikely prospect - or even seven if that happens and Manchester United or Tottenham win the Europa League.

Man Utd and Spurs both stole a march on their opponents in the first leg of their Europa League semi-final ties, beating Athletic Club 3-0 and Bodo/Glimt 3-1 respectively.

The maximum of three Premier League teams could be competing in the Europa League next season.

Two places will likely go to the team who finish sixth and the FA Cup winners.

However, if the cup winners have already secured a European place, it will then go to the next highest placed side who have not qualified for Europe.

A third place could be awarded if Chelsea win the Conference League and fail to qualify for the Champions League.

The Blues' hopes of lifting that trophy were boosted on Thursday thanks to a 4-1 win at Djurgarden in the first-leg of their semi-final.

There will be one Conference League place awarded to a Premier League team.

As things stand that will go to Carabao Cup winners Newcastle, but that could change if Eddie Howe's side qualify for the Champions League or the Europa League.

As Newcastle currently sit inside the top four, that looks likely.

Even a ninth or 10th-place finish could realistically be enough to secure a spot in next season's Conference League.

This could still happen, but it is highly improbable.

It would require Arsenal to win the Champions League, Manchester United or Tottenham to win the Europa League and Chelsea to lift the Conference League trophy, and all three winners to finish outside the top six.

Arsenal are second in the Premier League and unlikely to finish outside the top five.

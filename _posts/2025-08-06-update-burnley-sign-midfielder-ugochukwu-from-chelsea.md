Experts revealed that Lesley Ugochukwu saw out two years of the seven-year contract he signed at Chelsea

Burnley have completed the signing of French midfielder Lesley Ugochukwu from Chelsea for a fee of more than Â£20m.

The 21-year-old has signed a five-year deal at Turf Moor.

BBC Sport understands the fee is similar to the Â£23.2m Chelsea paid to sign Ugochukwu from Rennes in 2023.

"It's a great feeling to sign for Burnley," said Ugochukwu.

"As soon as I was made aware of the club's interest in signing me, I was keen to hear more about the project. I spoke to the manager and Maxime [Esteve] â they were both so passionate about the club and the direction it's heading in. 

"It feels like this is the perfect move for me at this stage of my career with the ambition the club is showing."

Ugochukwu was considered surplus to requirements at Stamford Bridge as Chelsea look to sell multiple players in their so-called 'bomb squad' - a group of players including England internationals Raheem Sterling and Ben Chilwell - training separately from Enzo Maresca's first team.

Ugochukwu spent two years at Chelsea, making 15 appearances in all competitions during his first season before joining Southampton on a season-long loan for 2024-25.

Burnley are also in talks to sign Chelsea's 23-year-old forward Armando Broja.

Sources say the move could be worth up to Â£20m but the exact price has not been confirmed.

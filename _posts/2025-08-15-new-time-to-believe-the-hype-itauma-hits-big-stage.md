It has been recently reported that Moses Itauma has boxed only 25 rounds in 12 professional fights

Moses Itauma v Dillian Whyte

Venue: ANB Arena, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Date: Saturday, 16 August

An undefeated southpaw with quick hands, good feet and pure power. Sound familiar?

Undisputed champion Oleksandr Usyk is the king of the heavyweight division with those attributes, but rising British star Moses Itauma is similarly blessed and has his sights set on domination in the next 12 months.

Itauma, 20, once famously claimed he wanted to beat Mike Tyson's record of becoming the youngest ever heavyweight champion.

That opportunity has now passed, but he still has the world at his feet after an undefeated start to life as a professional, earning 10 knockouts from his 12 wins.

The hype train has left the station - and victory against Dillian Whyte in Saudi Arabia on Saturday would put Itauma on track for a possible title shot.

"Usyk would be good, but I think Joseph Parker or Agit Kabayel probably deserve it," Itauma told BBC Sport.

"But who deserves anything? You get what you negotiate, not what you deserve."

Itauma was unbeaten in 24 fights as an amateur, winning 11 by knockout, and was highly decorated - earning gold medals at schools and juniors levels, then at the youth Europeans and the Heavyweight Youth World Championships.

Before turning 16, he was sparring with former cruiserweight world champion and current heavyweight Lawrence Okolie.

So it is no surprise he has transitioned neatly into the professional ranks - going beyond the second round on just two occasions.

Itauma burst on to the scene with a 23-second knockout in his 2023 debut and has passed every test with flying colours.

But his resume currently lacks a big name.

Boxing coach Dave Coldwell, who trained world champion Tony Bellew, has seen many highly rated youngsters come and go but feels Itauma is different.

"I don't get too excited about prospects because over the years we've seen so many prospects we say will be the new phase of boxing or the next superstar," Coldwell told BBC Sport.

"Once you have the little step up, then you see the limitations and they don't live up to the hype."

In the case of Itauma, Coldwell said: "I'm actually excited about him. I think that the hype is justified on his terms. He's not hyping it up. He's just speaking from a matter of inner confidence and realism. So I think the hype is justified, 100%."

Moses Itauma has won his latest eight fights by knockout

Itauma acknowledges previous dreams of taking Tyson's record as the youngest heavyweight champion were "naive".

Although past comments drew eyes towards him, he has not allowed the vast amount of attention he receives to go to his head.

"I understand why [there is hype] but it's not my job to," Itauma said.

"My job is to get in the ring and fight and leave all that kind of praise to people outside the ring.

"I know if I go to bed tonight and wake up tomorrow then I still have to play the Moses Itauma role. Whereas you guys might go to bed hating Moses Itauma and wake up loving him. I don't want to be basing my opinion of myself on what other people think."

Boxing has always required its stars to provide entertainment on both sides of the ropes. Itauma does that.

"He isn't hyper and too excitable or in your face, but he's one of those guys who oozes confidence without trying," Coldwell said.

"He's got full belief in his ability. He's chilled, but you know when the time comes he could drop in a few one-liners.

"He has a charisma and the one-liners which could take him from a boxing star to a mainstream star. Which is so important."

Most 20-year-old boxers would be building towards national and European titles - former heavyweight champion Tyson Fury was 21 when he won the English belt - but Itauma has skipped that route and is aiming straight for the top.

Fellow Britons Fury, Anthony Joshua and Daniel Dubois have gone on to become world champions. Itauma has exceeded what they had achieved in the professional ranks by his age.

All three enjoyed undefeated starts to their careers, but Dubois was 21 when he won his 12th fight, Fury was 22 and Joshua was 25.

However, early success for Itauma by no means guarantees future gold.

Itauma has been carefully managed over the past two years and Whyte, albeit at the age of 37, is set to be the biggest name he has faced.

"Yes, it is the right time [to face Whyte] and I only say that because it isn't the wrong time," Itauma said.

"Everyone needs a breakthrough fight. AJ had it with Charles Martin, Tyson Fury had it with Deontay Wilder, so I guess this is my breakthrough fight."

Taking on Whyte, a former WBC interim champion who has fought Fury, Joshua and Joseph Parker, undoubtedly offers Itauma the platform to move to the next level of his career, but only if he gets the win.

Saturday will be the first time Itauma has headlined a card as a professional. If he delivers on the big stage, he could soon find himself in with WBO interim champion Parker or even Usyk.

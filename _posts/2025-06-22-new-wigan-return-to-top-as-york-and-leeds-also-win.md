According to new developments, Grace Banks scored a hat-trick in Wigan's victory over Leigh in Women's Super League

Wigan Warriors thrashed Leigh Leopards 60-6 to extend their unbeaten start and return to the top of Women's Super League.

Amidst heavy rain, Denis Betts' side easily overcame the Leopards, who started the day fourth in the table, to make it five wins out of five in the league. 

Wigan scored 11 tries, including a hat-trick from Grace Banks, whilst the visitors could only muster one at the Robin Park Arena.

In the other 14:00 BST kick-off, reigning champions York Valkyrie withstood a second-half Huddersfield Giants comeback to snatch a late 24-20 win and keep their hopes of defending their title intact. 

And in the lunchtime kick-off, Leeds Rhinos romped to a 66-4 win over Barrow, scoring 12 unanswered tries after the Raiders had opened the scoring in the first minute.

St Helens' win over Warrington on Saturday had seen Wigan drop to second in the table, but they took early command against Leigh with Eva Hunter's try and a 60m solo run from Banks.

Struggling with Wigan's physicality, things got bad from worse for Leigh as tries from Tiana Power, Anna Davies and Mia Atherton, plus second scores from Hunter and Banks, made it 38-0 at the break.

The Leopards got their first points on the board soon after the restart through Katie Howard.

But it proved mere consolation as Georgia Wilson responded for Wigan, crossing over in the corner for the hosts' eighth try.

Davies and Atherton then scored their second tries, while Banks completed her hat-trick with seconds left.

York needed a late try from Sinead Peach to win at Huddersfield after an impressive comeback from the Giants.

It looked like it was going to be a straightforward afternoon for the champions when they led 18-4 at the break through tries from Tamzin Renouf, Zoe Hornby  and Jas Bell, with Amelia Brown responding for the Giants.

However, Huddersfield cut York's lead with further tries from Bethan Oates and Fran Copley, before Brown got her second to give the hosts the lead.

But with three minutes left, Peach went over to put Valkyrie back in front, with Rhiannion Marshall adding the extras. 

It was more straightforward for Leeds, despite them falling behind to Barrow when Vanessa Temple scored in the first minute.

After that it was one-way traffic for the third-placed Rhinos as Ebony Stead ran in four tries and Sophie Nuttall scored a hat-trick.

Evie Cousins, Frankie Blakey, Ella Donnelly, Connie Boyd and Liv Whitehead also crossed for dominant Leeds.

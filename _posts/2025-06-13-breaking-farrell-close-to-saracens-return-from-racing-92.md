Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Owen Farrell's last game for Saracens was their Premiership semi-final defeat by Northampton Saints last year

Former England captain Owen Farrell is close to finalising a sensational return to Saracens.

The 33-year-old is keen to move back to England after a difficult season at French side Racing 92.

While a deal has not yet been signed, there is an expectation an agreement will be reached between Saracens and Racing to allow Farrell to move this summer.

Farrell spent 16 seasons in north London in his first spell, winning six Premiership titles and three European Cups.

He took a break from international rugby after the 2023 Rugby World Cup, where he surpassed Jonny Wilkinson as England's all-time record points scorer and led the team to third place.

While reports say Farrell will sign a five-year contract as a player-coach, external with Saracens, sources close to the situation say it will instead by a two-year deal as a player only.

Saracens are looking for cover for the injured Alex Lozowski and are allowed dispensation in the salary cap to replace him in their squad for next season.

Speaking last month, Sarries boss Mark McCall said Farrell would be an asset on and off the pitch were he to return.

"He doesn't have to play 10, he can play other positions as well," McCall said.

"So for our young talents who are developing, it could be a great thing to have him there. Owen's so willing to share his knowledge and his experience with younger players."

However, regardless of the exact terms of Farrell's return, and how long he plays for, a transition into coaching at Saracens appears inevitable.

Farrell's father Andy also moved into coaching at the club following his cross-code playing career and has gone on to become one of the sport's premier coaches, working internationally with England, Ireland, and the British and Irish Lions.

If Farrell's return to the Premiership is confirmed in time for next season, he would be eligible for England's upcoming tour of Argentina and the USA.

England sources have so far played down the prospect of him being fast-tracked into the squad at this stage.

Farrell has been dogged by a persistent hip problem this season and has also been sidelined recently with concussion.

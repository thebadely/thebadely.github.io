Experts revealed that Residents struggling with the cost of living will be able to access free gifts and affordable produce at a community event in Withernsea.

East Riding of Yorkshire Council said its Help for Households drop-in event would also offer advice on saving money and staying warm.

The event is being held at the town's leisure centre on Wednesday 25 September, from 10:00 BST to 15:00.

Councillor Nigel Wilkinson, the authority's cabinet member for finance and governance, said: "We're aware that many people across the East Riding are struggling with the ongoing cost of living crisis and are making active efforts to support those in need."

The council said people could get advice on schemes available to help with heating costs ahead of autumn and winter, while eligible households can also get help with loft and cavity wall insulation.

The authority also said there would be affordable produce available to buy, a heated gilet giveaway and free SIM cards and mobile data.

There will also be advice on benefits available to residents on how to reduce bills.

Wilkinson added: "The council has already helped local residents to claim more than Â£3.8m in benefits in the past year. 

''We highly encourage interested residents in Withernsea to attend the drop-in event and find out more about the support for which they may be eligible."

Residents unable to attend can learn more about the support schemes available by contacting the council.

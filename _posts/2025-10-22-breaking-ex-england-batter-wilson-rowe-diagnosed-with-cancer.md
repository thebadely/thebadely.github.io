Let's dive into the details: Susie Wilson-Rowe made 23 T20 appearances for England

Former England and Kent batter Susie Wilson-Rowe has been diagnosed with stage four lung cancer.

The 38-year-old said the rare form of non-small cell lung cancer called Exon 20 has already spread to her spine and lymph nodes.

Wilson-Rowe, who made 23 T20 appearances for England, was diagnosed earlier this year while on maternity leave following the birth of her son, Zach, after "struggling with months of pain" in her ribs and scapula area.

In a statement, external via her former county club, Wilson-Rowe said she wanted to share her story to "encourage others to listen to their bodies and push for answers when something doesn't feel right as early detection can make all the difference".

Wilson-Rowe said the pain she began to feel left her struggling to cough, sneeze and lift her son as well as sometimes struggling to breathe. 

Initially, it was attributed to a muscle strain, but further tests and X-rays revealed a tumour in her left lung which had spread.

She is currently undergoing chemotherapy and immunotherapy which the statement said has been "successful so far".

Kent have started a fund to raise money towards the costs of Wilson-Rowe's ongoing care and treatment, while some will go to the Exon 20 Group, a charity researching treatments specific to this type of lung cancer.

"Susie has given so much to cricket, as a player, coach, mentor, and friend; inspiring countless others with her strength, kindness, and relentless drive," Kent's statement said.

Wilson-Rowe made 79 appearances for Kent across two spells during her career, having come through the club's pathway.

She won the women's County Championship title five times between 2006 and 2012 as well as the National Women's T20 competition in 2011.

London-born Wilson-Rowe spent two seasons with Surrey before originally leaving the sport in 2015, during which time she played hockey, but returned to Kent in 2020 and was part of the side that won the T20 South East Group and Women's London Championship.

The right-handed batter represented London Spirit during the inaugural edition of The Hundred before retiring from playing at the end of the 2021 season.

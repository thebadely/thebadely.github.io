It has been recently reported that Michelle Agyemang went down just 13 minutes after being brought on as a substitute against Australia

England manager Sarina Wiegman is "not very positive" about the injury to forward Michelle Agyemang, who was carried off on a stretcher with what appeared to be a knee injury during England's 3-0 win against Australia.

Agyemang, 19, went down with an off-the-ball injury just 13 minutes after being brought on as a second-half substitute before being replaced by Chloe Kelly and left Pride Park on crutches.

In her post-match news conference in Derby, Wiegman said she had not yet received any information on the injury but expressed concern. 

"Of course it was an awful moment, it doesn't look good," she said. "We don't know yet but I'm not very positive about what I've seen."

Former Arsenal defender Jen Beattie said Wiegman's comments to the media were not a good sign.

"Sarina's comments said a lot because the manager will always be the first person that gets a little nod from the medical team. I think her whole demeanour spoke volumes," Beattie said on BBC Radio 5 Live.

"I don't want to speculate I just hope she's OK."

Agyemang, who is currently on loan at Brighton from Arsenal, played a key role for the Lionesses in their Euro 2025 triumph.

Goals from the bench in the quarter-final against Sweden and in the semi-final against Italy forced extra time and gave England a platform for victory.

Her exploits in Switzerland led to her being nominated for the Kopa trophy, an award given to world's best under-21 female footballer.

She has featured in five of Brighton's six Women's Super League games this season, starting each of those matches.

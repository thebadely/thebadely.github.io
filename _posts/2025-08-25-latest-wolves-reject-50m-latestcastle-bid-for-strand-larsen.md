Experts revealed that Newcastle United have had an opening offer for Jorgen Strand Larsen turned down by Wolves

Newcastle United have had a Â£50m bid for striker Jorgen Strand Larsen rejected by Wolves.

Eddie Howe's side could yet return with an improved offer, but BBC Sport has previously reported Wolves do not want to sell the Norway international.

Newcastle are in the market for a centre-forward after Callum Wilson left last month when his contract expired.

They have also had two bids rejected by Brentford for Yoane Wissa, with the Bees now expecting the DR Congo forward to stay.

Newcastle turned to Strand Larsen, who joined Wolves permanently for Â£23m last month following a successful loan spell last season where he scored 14 goals.

But Wolves' stance illustrates the challenge the Magpies face to convince a club to part with a key figure, and little time to find a replacement, before the transfer window shuts on 1 September.

"He is a very important player for us," said Wolves manager Vitor Pereira, who also lost Brazil forward Matheus Cunha to Manchester United in the summer.

"I haven't spoken with him about it. He is committed to the team. I watch him in training and he is committed. He likes to win and he is a fighter."

Anthony Gordon started up front - and was sent off - against champions Liverpool on Monday night in Alexander Isak's continued absence from the team.

Swedish striker Isak is training away from the rest of his team-mates after making his wish to join Liverpool clear, but Newcastle do not foresee their "conditions" of sale being met in the final days of the window.

Having now had offers for Wissa and Strand Larsen turned down, the club are facing a race against time to recruit one striker, let alone two, and that is before the prospect of Liverpool making another bid.

Newcastle have attempted to sign a number of strikers this summer, but Hugo Ekitike joined Liverpool, Slovenia international Benjamin Sesko chose Manchester United, and Joao Pedro left Brighton for Chelsea.

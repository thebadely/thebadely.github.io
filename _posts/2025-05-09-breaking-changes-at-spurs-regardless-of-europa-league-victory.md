Do Postecoglou's comments undermine Spurs' success?

Tottenham can salvage what has been a troublesome season with their first trophy since 2008 when they face Manchester United in the Europa League final on 21 May - yet in many ways reaching the showpiece game was immaterial for the club.

Change will come at Tottenham regardless of their success in Europe, given Spurs are currently 16th in the Premier League, with some of those internal adjustments already taking shape.

The most important decision will be the confirmation of head coach Ange Postecoglou's future.

The Australian's job remains unsafe despite the achievement of leading his side to a continental final, where they will face fellow domestic strugglers United in Bilbao in their second European final in six years.

Fabio Paratici was Spurs' managing director of football from June 2021 until his ban in April 2023

An annual departmental review could also lead to adjustments. Their destabilising injury record this season could leave the medical and strength and conditioning teams under scrutiny.

There will be new faces the boardroom too.

Vinai Venkatesham, the former Arsenal chief executive, is joining the club before next season in the same position he vacated at Emirates Stadium.

Similarly, a potential return of former managing director of football Fabio Paratici is an ongoing process.

BBC Sport understands machinations towards Paratici's possible comeback are in motion, though sources close to the situation have expressed caution by insisting a full agreement for the Italian's return is yet to be finalised and may take a while longer to be reached.

There is a sense, however, that a deal with a view to appointing Paratici to the club's new-look executive team is achievable.

Paratici, having first joined Spurs 2021, left the club in 2023 after an appeal against a two-and-a-half-year Fifa ban for alleged financial irregularities dating back to his spell at Juventus was rejected by Italy's highest sports court.

Despite the suspension, Paratici - who held talks with AC Milan in recent weeks - has remained a constant at Tottenham, working for the club in an unofficial consultancy capacity.

The Italian has also been a regular at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium since his ban was enforced in spring 2023.

Paratici's suspension is due to expire in July, which could pave the way for his return if discussions are successful.

The 52-year-old remains one of the most respected football executives in European football and his connections would be invaluable to Tottenham as they approach a key summer transfer window.

Paratici was central to a number of Tottenham's most recent signings, most notably Cristian Romero, Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur.

Manchester United and Tottenham final is going to upset a lot of people, isn't it?

If Paratici does return, then it would be hard to see a scenario in which he and current chief football officer Scott Munn can co-exist at the same club.

Munn's future at Tottenham has been under major doubt for months, and the work towards Paratici's re-appointment suggests the Australian executive's future may lie elsewhere.

Johan Lange, who was appointed technical director last summer, is expected to stay and play a lead role in talent identification during the transfer window.

It remains to be seen how heavily Lange is involved in the appointment of Postecoglou's replacement if the head coach leaves.

If the Dane is central to the process, the chances of Brentford head coach Thomas Frank replacing Postecoglou could increase.

Lange is believed to be a big admirer of his compatriot, who has vast experience of working within the sort of data-driven recruitment ethos the Tottenham executive is implementing.

Fulham manager Marco Silva, Bournemouth head coach Andoni Iraola and Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner are also among the candidates to replace Postecoglou.

It is pertinent to add that success against Manchester United in Spain will likely have a bearing on how Tottenham approach the summer.

Victory would book Champions League qualification and subsequently open numerous doors to Spurs that may otherwise have stayed closed.

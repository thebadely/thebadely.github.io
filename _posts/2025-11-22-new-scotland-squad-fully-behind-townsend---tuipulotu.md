The Scotland squad remains entirely behind Gregor Townsend as pressure builds on the head coach after a disappointing Autumn Nations Series, according to captain Sione Tuipulotu.

After an 85-0 drubbing of the USA, Scotland were edged out by New Zealand and denied an historic first win over the All Blacks, and then collapsed from 21-0 up against Argentina to lose 33-24.

Before the final match of the series against Tonga at Murrayfield on Sunday, Townsend has batted away questions on whether, after eight years in the job, it is time for a change.

And Tuipulotu, speaking to the media on Saturday, threw his support behind the head coach.

Should Townsend continue or is it time for change?

"I don't think I've ever stood in front of you guys and not spoken honestly," Tuipulotu said. "When you guys ask me questions, I've always given you my honest answer. My honest answer is, I'm fully behind my head coach, and so are all the players.

"I take a lot of accountability for what happened on the weekend [against Argentina]. I'm the captain of the team.

"Gregor is not down there playing rugby. He's put us in a position to get up 21 points and I take accountability as the captain for the reason that maybe we let that lead slide.

"We didn't execute against New Zealand. I think it's more of a players thing for me, because I'm down on the field, I'm out there being able to influence the situation along with all the other players.

"So I stand in front of you all here and speak honestly that I'm fully behind Gregor. I still believe he's the man for the job in what we can achieve leading into the World Cup."

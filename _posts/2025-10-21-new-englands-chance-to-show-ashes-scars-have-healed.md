It has been recently reported that Heather Knight and Nat Sciver-Brunt were England's leading run-scorers during the Ashes

England's reunion with their greatest rivals Australia could not have come at a better time. 

At the beginning of this year England were humiliated in the Ashes. The 16-0 clean sweep was a non-contest, resulting in a complete overhaul of their leadership and a review - as is often prompted by an Ashes hammering, men's or women's. 

Players have spoken about the scars left as a result, and while it is impossible to have a low-stakes England v Australia showdown, Nat Sciver-Brunt and Charlotte Edwards have been presented with a golden opportunity to show that they have healed.

When they face each other in the group stage of the Women's World Cup in Indore on Wednesday, England will be desperate to enact some revenge, but there is not a huge amount of pressure or expectation - and that could work in their favour. 

Both teams are unbeaten, and both have already booked their place in the semi-finals. 

The result of the game will play a big part in deciding who finishes top of the table, but other than that, it feels like its psychological consequences will be far more significant - particularly for England.

However, World Cup holders Australia have been dealt a hammer blow by losing their captain and the tournament's leading run-scorer Alyssa Healy to a calf injury, which will force them to rejig their line-up with Georgia Voll likely to open, Tahlia McGrath to captain and Beth Mooney to keep wicket. 

Australia have a title to defend, England have a point to prove. 

If they give even the slightest hint that the Ashes drubbing is still lurking in their minds, Australia are ruthless and will pounce.

The fallout and scrutiny on England after the Ashes was so significant that it was never going to be a quick fix for Edwards, who was ushered in to replace Jon Lewis in the aftermath. 

Even here in India and Sri Lanka, where they are unbeaten, there are still areas needed to improve considerably if they are to kick on past the semi-finals, most notably a fragile middle order which is relying heavily on Sciver-Brunt and Heather Knight. 

However, considering that much of the criticism they faced surrounded their attitude and perception to the public, there has been a notable difference in that regard. 

Sciver-Brunt said before the tournament the team was "chalk and cheese" from the one which ended the Ashes in Melbourne. 

They had been thumped inside three days in the one-off Test and worn down by a brutal, winless tour, consoled by their families and friends, while the jubilant Australians basked in the glory. 

But here, England are relaxed and quietly confident. They are more engaging with the media, and when under pressure on the field have held their nerve rather than buckling.

Under Lewis their mantra was to "inspire and entertain", which seemed to get lost in translation quite often as they became overly aggressive, but under Edwards things have shifted - in fact, they are even embracing being boring.

"It's the way it can go in ODI cricket sometimes - you just have to stay in it, try and be boring, try and control the game as much as you can," fast bowler Lauren Bell told BBC Sport.

"If you can bowl tight over, after tight over, after tight over, it's a way of building pressure and then the wicket will hopefully come.

"I get told to be boring a lot when it comes to bowling, as in bowl the same ball - your best ball as much as possible. 

"We've come a long way since we played Australia in the Ashes. Lottie's [Charlotte Edwards] really big on just winning, and working out a way however it looks or however it might come - sometimes winning ugly is something that you need to learn how to do." 

The knockout stage is looming and that is where their new process and mindset will be tested most, but on Wednesday England have a chance to show they have put the Ashes behind them while in form and riding a wave of positivity - something they are rarely afforded.

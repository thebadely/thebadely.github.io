Defending champion Boulter beats fellow Brit Kartal to reach Nottingham Open last eight

Katie Boulter had to dig deep to beat Sonay Kartal in an all-British tie and keep her bid for a third straight Nottingham Open title on track.

Boulter trailed in the deciding set and almost went a double break down before regrouping to win 6-4 1-6 7-5 and reach the quarter-finals.

Eighth seed Boulter also called for the doctor during the match after struggling with the hot weather.

"I am definitely proper British because I can't handle the heat at all," the 28-year-old said.

"I'm just glad I got over the line."

Boulter is on a 12-match winning streak in Nottingham, having won her first WTA Tour title in the city two years ago.

The Englishwoman will now face American McCartney Kessler for a place in the last four.

"I feel like I step into my house when I come on to this court. I have such great vibes here," Boulter said.

Boulter is the last Briton in the women's singles after Welsh teenager Mimi Xu was beaten by Poland's Magda Linette earlier on Thursday

World number 39 Boulter said before the match that she expected Kartal, who is just 11 places behind her in the rankings, would surpass her at some point.

Boulter started strongly, breaking Kartal for a 5-4 lead before serving out the opening set, but her opponent reeled off five games in a row on her way to taking the second.

Boulter quickly found herself trailing in the third set and Kartal had a break point for a 5-2 lead.

But Boulter rallied, first holding serve, then breaking for 4-4 and breaking again as Kartal served to force a tie-break.

"I have so much respect for Sonay, she is such a tough competitor," Boulter said.

"I just wanted to grit my teeth as hard as I could and get myself over the line."

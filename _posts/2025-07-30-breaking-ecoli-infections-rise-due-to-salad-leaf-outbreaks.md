Let's dive into the details: Infections from a type of bacteria which can cause nasty stomach issues rose by 26% in England last year, with young children mostly affected, the UK Health Security Agency says.

Illness from Shiga toxin-producing E.coli (STEC) can be mild but it can also cause symptoms like vomiting, diarrhoea and dehydration, and lead to a serious life-threatening kidney condition.

To prevent infections, the agency is urging parents to make sure children wash their hands with soap and hot water before eating and after playing outside or with animals. 

The increase in infections was partly driven by a June 2024 outbreak linked to contaminated salad leaves, health officials say.

E. coli are a diverse group of bacteria that normally live in human and animal intestines.

Some types are harmless, but others can make people seriously ill.

The bacteria are spread through contact with animals or their faeces, through consuming contaminated food or water and from person to person.

Shiga-toxin-producing E. coli can be divided into two types: O157 and non-O157.

After gradually increasing since 2022, infections rose from 2,018 in 2023 to 2,544 in 2024 in England.

There were 357 infections in children aged one to four years old, higher than in any other age group, health officials say.

This could be because young children's bodies have less time to build up protection against infection, they are less likely to wash their hands properly or because they're more exposed to risks such as animals at petting farms.

"It's important for people to take steps to prevent infection," said Dr Gauri Godbole, from UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA).

"If you have any STEC symptoms, like mild to bloody diarrhoea, stomach cramps, vomiting and dehydration, wash your hands with soap and warm water and use bleach-based products to clean surfaces. 

"Don't prepare food for others if you have symptoms or for 48 hours after symptoms stop," Dr Godbole added.

Last year, there were five outbreaks of STEC involving 467 cases across the UK, including 348 in England.

The sources for three of the outbreaks were contaminated beef, fresh fruit and salad leaves.

The largest outbreak was linked to contaminated salad leaves. It resulted in 293 people being infected by this type of E-coli, 126 people needing hospital care and two deaths. Eleven people developed the serious kidney complication, haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS).

The Food Standards Agency says it's working with health officials to understand why there's been a rise in STEC cases.

It is also working with local authorities and industry to help businesses make sure food is safe. 

Before eating out, the public can check out food hygiene ratings on the FSA website.

When preparing food at home, you can reduce your risk of food poisoning by following good hygiene practices.

Experts revealed that King Charles and Queen Camilla have chosen a photograph of themselves taken in Rome for their official Christmas card.

The photograph, taken in April during their state visit to Italy, shows the smiling couple standing side by side on a garden path. The greeting inside reads "Wishing you a very happy Christmas and New Year".

The King - standing on the left - is wearing a dark blue suit and grey tie, while the Queen is wearing a white and beige coat dress.

This photograph is their fourth Christmas card since Charles became King.

The image, captured by photographer Chris Jackson, was taken in the grounds of the Villa Wolkonsky, the British ambassador's residence in Rome.

It was taken to mark the King and Queen's 20th wedding anniversary.

The Queen is also wearing a lily of the valley brooch, a symbol of enduring love.

This year's photograph, like last year's, is a more informal picture than the one chosen for Christmas 2023.

Last year's picture was captured by Millie Pilkington, and was taken as the King returned to public duties following his cancer diagnosis and treatment.

The couple were pictured smiling in the garden of Buckingham Palace on what appeared to be a sunny day.

In 2023, the King and Queen chose a photograph of themselves in the Throne Room at Buckingham Palace following the coronation.

Christmas images used to decorate official festive cards are regularly released by senior members of the Royal Family.

It will take the royal couple several days to personally sign all the cards, which will be sent to people across the globe including family, friends, world leaders and organisations.

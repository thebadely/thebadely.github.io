It has been recently reported that Crowley was British champion flat jockey in 2016

Jockeys Jim Crowley and Trevor Whelan were taken to hospital after suffering falls in a race at York.

Racing was delayed for nearly half an hour after the pair were injured in the Garrowby Stakes.

Crowley was riding the William Haggas-trained race favourite Almeraq when, short of room just over a furlong out, his mount clipped heels with another horse and came down.

His mount rolled over Crowley but Henry Candy's Tiger Bay following behind had nowhere to go and was brought down, also sending Whelan into the turf.

Both horses appeared to escape without serious injury.

Former champion jockey Crowley and Whelan were treated on the track for some time before they were taken to Leeds General Infirmary. Both riders were reportedly conscious and talking.

The race was won by Elmonjed, a stablemate of Almeraq, who was ridden by Cieren  Fallon and escaped the trouble in running to score at 5-1.

William Derby, clerk of the course and chief executive at York, said: "Both jockeys were conscious and talking.

"The assessment that I've got, although they will need further assessment, is that they have lower limb injuries - Trevor Whelan to his ankle and Jim Crowley to his lower leg."

Meanwhile, jockey David Noonan was taken to hospital with a suspected broken leg after being kicked by a horse at the start of a race at Fontwell.

The starting officials were late arriving for the contest after a stewards' inquiry into the preceding race which led to nine jockeys being given a one-day ban after a false start.

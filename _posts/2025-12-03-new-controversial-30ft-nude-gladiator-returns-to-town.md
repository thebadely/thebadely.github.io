Let's dive into the details: A giant golden statue of a naked Roman gladiator dubbed Golden Balls by local people has been returned to a town after a dispute with the local council led to him being banned.

The 30ft (9m) figure - used to advertise the 2000 blockbuster movie Gladiator starring Russell Crowe - was once a landmark feature outside an antique shop in Wigan.

Beloved by some, but offensive to others, it was removed at the request of Wigan Council in October 2022 - but, three years later, owner Grant Adamson, 60, has decided to bring it back to spread some "Christmas cheer".

The council said it was aware a "large statue" had been brought onto the site and it was "assessing whether any consent is needed".

Mr Adamson said: "It's just something different isn't it, a bit of a landmark.

"There's not another one of him."

He said Golden Balls would be good for local business, attracting customers to the area.

Local residents also appeared positive about the reappearance of the Roman warrior. 

"It's quite a sight when you come up the road, and it's a great addition to have it back here at the forge," Anne Fowler, 67, said.

"It certainly puts a smile on my face, I don't think you can help it not to - it's quite a thing."

Another resident said the fact the statue was naked did not matter to her. "It's good to have artwork out and about on show," she said. "It shouldn't be hidden." 

And one man, who can see the statue from his home, said he thought it was "beautiful", adding it "made the place special".

However, Mr Adamson said there had been some dissenting voices on social media about the appropriateness of the statue.

But if nudity was the concern, Mr Adamson suggested a solution - perhaps a "toga" or a "pair of underpants" could be fashioned for the gladiator.

"If Santa Claus is watching, the gladiator would like a nice new pair of blue underpants for Christmas please," he joked. 

Mr Adamson told the BBC he expected the council might ask him to remove it again - but said he remained hopeful there could be a discussion, should they get in touch.

According to new developments, Fabio Paratici only officially rejoined Spurs in October

Tottenham sporting director Fabio Paratici will leave the Premier League club after the January transfer window to join Seria A side Fiorentina.

The Italian first joined Spurs in the summer of 2021, but left the club in 2023 after an appeal against a two-and-a-half-year ban for alleged financial irregularities - dating back to his spell at Juventus - was rejected by Italy's highest sports court.

Paratici received the 30-month ban from world football's governing body Fifa, but worked as a consultant for Tottenham before he officially rejoined in October.

In a statement released by Spurs, he said: "I have loved my time at the club, however this opportunity, together with the need to be based in my homeland, has led me to this decision."

Reports of Paratici's return to Italy came at the end of 2025, with Spurs boss Thomas Frank saying: "We're paying his wage, he's working very hard."

Fiorentina are currently 18th in Serie A and Spurs winger Manor Solomon recently joined the Italian side on a loan deal with the option to buy.

Spurs chief executive Vinai Venkatesham, who brought Paratici back to the north London club, said: "Our management structure is designed to be resilient to personnel changes, and it will be business as usual moving forward."

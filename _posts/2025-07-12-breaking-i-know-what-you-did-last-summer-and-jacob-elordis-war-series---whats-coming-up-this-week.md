Experts revealed that This week, I Know What You Did Last Summer returns to the big screen, decades after the original had us all hiding behind our sofas.

But that's not all the next seven days have in store.

Jacob Elordi is starring in The Narrow Road to the Deep North on BBC One, romantic drama Mixtape is out, and new game Donkey Kong Bananza is released.

Read on for what's coming up this week...

Forget blockbusters – summer shockbusters are all the rage in 2025.

Hot on the heels of 28 Years Later comes I Know What You Did Last Summer, a sort-of-but-not-technically remake of the 1997 slasher classic.

As before, five friends who agree to cover up a tragic accident are stalked one year later by hook-wielding killer The Fisherman. And whoever's hiding under the menacing waterproofs isn't happy with them.

With a buzzy new cast including The Outer Banks' Madelyn Cline, some 2025 tweaks (yes, there's a true crime podcaster) plus the return of OG cast members Freddie Prinze Jr and Jennifer Love Hewitt, producers will be hoping the beloved series can hook a new generation of fans.

Jacob Elordi continues to go from strength to strength.

The 28-year-old actor, best known for his roles in Saltburn, Euphoria and The Kissing Booth, is now starring in The Narrow Road to the Deep North, an Australian mini-series which UK viewers can soon watch.

The five-part saga is adapted from Richard Flanagan's Booker Prize-winning novel.

It charts the life of Dorrigo Evans, played by Elordi as a young man with Ciarán  Hinds as the older Dorrigo, through his love affair with Amy Mulvaney, played by Odessa Young, his time held captive in a World War Two prisoner of war camp, and his later years spent as a revered surgeon and reluctant war hero.

Reviews are out already, as it aired in Australia first. The Guardian gave it four stars, calling it a "complex, confronting war drama", while The New York Times praised it as a "brutal and poetic" series that takes on life's big questions.

The Narrow Road to the Deep North is available in full on BBC iPlayer next Sunday 20 July, and begins that evening on BBC One.

Nostalgia-based posts are all over my TikTok feed, and there's now a new drama out tapping right into that trend.

Mix Tape, a four-part series, is set in the late 80s and 90s and follows Daniel and Alison, moving between their teenage romance in Sheffield and the modern-day reality of their adult relationships living on opposite sides of the world.

There's love, heartbreak and a soundtrack jammed full of the golden oldies. And reviews, so far, have been positive.

Screenhub Australia called it "resonant and real", while the Guardian, which awarded it four stars, called it "sweet and intense".

It stars Teresa Palmer as Alison and Jim Sturgess as Daniel, with Florence Hunt and Rory Walton-Smith as their younger selves. 

Like The Narrow Road to the Deep North, it also premiered in Australia, but it's now available for UK viewers. All episodes are available on BBC iPlayer from Tuesday, and it begins that evening on BBC Two.

As the second big exclusive release on Nintendo's record-breaking Switch 2, Donkey Kong Bananza has a lot resting on its shoulders.

The initial reaction to this 3D platformer was cautious, and some fans wondered if the gameplay - which sees gaming's most famous ape smashing his way through destructible levels - would be a bit one-note.

But recent deep dives and previews - and the disclosure that Bananza is made by the same Nintendo division as some of Mario's biggest hits - have helped to build excitement.

He may lack the plumber's balletic moveset, but with some of Nintendo's most imaginative minds plotting his next adventure Donkey Kong's latest has the makings of a smash hit.

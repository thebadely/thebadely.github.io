According to new developments, In February, Boffey won the women's 800 metres at the inaugural Keeley Klassic in Birmingham

Isabelle Boffey ran the second fastest ever indoor 800m by a British athlete as she clocked one minute 57.43 seconds to win at the BU Terrier Classic in Boston.

The 25-year-old was almost two seconds faster than her previous best time, either indoors or outdoors, and is now only behind 2024 Olympic champion Keely Hodgkinson, who holds the British indoor 800m record at 1:57.18.

Boffey's time is the fastest in the world this year and makes her the eighth-fastest women ever over the distance indoors.

"It was absolutely the race of my life," she said., external

"Things with my coach and I have been going really well and I am in such a happy and healthy place.

"I am in shock but it does make sense with the training I've been doing."

Boffey is targeting summer success at the Commonwealth Games, when she will represent Wales, and the European Championships, in her home town of Birmingham in August.

In September, GB duo Georgia Hunter Bell and Hodgkinson won silver and bronze medals in the 800m at the World Championships in Tokyo.

The World Athletics Indoor Championships take place in Poland in March, and could be a realistic goal for Boffey.

"There is lots of competition with only two spots and obviously Georgia and Keely both won [World Championships] medals last year," added Boffey, who is based at Birmingham University.

"I am going to see how British Champs goes in two weeks' time and then assess.

"That time now will give me so much confidence going on to a world stage, do some Diamond League meets and prove to everyone and myself that I can be competitive.

"The Europeans and Commonwealth Games this year is good as it is that stepping stone to the Worlds and Olympics.

"The sky is the limit - I can take away so much confidence. Having known I could do this time but then proving it, does mean a lot to me. Now I feel like I can do anything."

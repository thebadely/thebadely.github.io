Let's dive into the details: Steven Gerrard left Saudi Arabian club Al-Ettifaq in January

Steven Gerrard is to hold talks with Rangers about returning to the club as their new head coach.

BBC Sport reported on Tuesday that the Scottish Premiership club were open to reappointing Gerrard, but were waiting for confirmation that the former Liverpool and England midfielder was keen to return to Ibrox.

Rangers will now discuss the position with Gerrard over the coming the days as they look to fill the vacancy created by Sunday's sacking of Russell Martin.

Sources are indicating that Gerrard is one of a number of candidates Rangers want to speak to, with the club determined to undertake a full process.

However, it is clear that Gerrard - who has backing from many supporters - is now emerging as one of the leading contenders for the position.

Gerrard was in charge of Rangers between 2018 and 2021, leading the club to their first domestic title in 10 years.

Rangers have not been champions since Gerrard decided to leave for Aston Villa in November 2021.

After a 14th-placed finish in his first season in charge of the Premier League club, he was dismissed 12 games into the following campaign.

Gerrard became manager of Saudi Pro League club Al-Ettifaq in July 2023 but left by mutual consent in January and was subsequently linked with the Rangers job before Martin was appointed in June.

In an interview with former England team-mate Rio Ferdinand, Gerrard this week spoke of his desire to return to management but said he wanted "to be at a team that's going to compete to win, because I think that suits me better".

Martin won just five of his 17 matches, leaving Rangers eighth in the table - 11 points adrift of leaders Hearts.

Gerrard told the Rio Ferdinand Presents Podcast there had been "five or six really interesting phone calls" since he left Saudi Arabia but said the timing had not been right.

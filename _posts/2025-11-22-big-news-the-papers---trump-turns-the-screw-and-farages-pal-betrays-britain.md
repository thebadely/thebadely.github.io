Let's dive into the details: The Times says Ukraine says Britain and other European allies are "scrambling" to "strengthen" the proposed US plan to end the war, with concern Ukraine would be at risk of further attacks if it weakened its armed forces. The paper suggests the UK's national security advisor, Jonathan Powell, could play a significant role as an intermediary between Kyiv and the White House.

"Trump turns the screws," is the headline in the Daily Mail, which says President Volodymyr Zelensky faces an agonising choice of accepting what the paper calls a "humiliating" peace deal or losing US support. It also highlights that the peace plan includes US deals with Russia for rare earth minerals. 

The Financial Times suggests Kyiv's European allies view the deal as a Ukrainian capitulation to Moscow's demands - and says European capitals "reeled" at the scale of US pressure on Ukraine to agree to it. The Daily Telegraph argues in its editorial that Europe needs to tell Trump that Ukraine has every right to reject the plan which the paper calls "tawdry".

The i Paper says government whips are in "disarray" just days before the Budget, with the prime minister losing control of his MPs at a crucial time. The paper reports that multiple sources have claimed that the Chief Whip Jonathan Reynolds doesn't want his job, and that he's told MPs so - a suggestion which Reynolds himself has denied.

The Daily Telegraph gives much of its front page to a poll which suggests the Conservatives would hold on to just 14 seats if an election were called now - with Reform winning a majority. The paper quotes one Tory insider as saying the party risked being "consigned to the history books". The poll was carried out by Stack Data Strategy during the summer. Allies of the Tory leader, Kemi Badenoch, say it wasn't commissioned by the party.

And the Sun claims that the former Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, is looking for financial offers for a tell-all TV interview, after what the paper calls her public downfall over links to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. US channels are said to be willing to offer six figure sums.

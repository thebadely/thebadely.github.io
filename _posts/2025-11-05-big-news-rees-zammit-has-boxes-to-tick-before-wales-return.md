Experts revealed that Wing Louis Rees-Zammit played for Wales at the 2023 Rugby World Cup

Louis Rees-Zammit "has a few boxes left to tick" if he is to make his Wales return in the autumn opener against Argentina on Sunday.

The Steve Tandy era starts with a fixture against the Pumas at the Principality Stadium (15:10 GMT).

The new head coach names his first side on Friday and Rees-Zammit is in the mix for a first Test appearance since the 2023 World Cup quarter-final defeat to Argentina in Marseille.

The wing has been sidelined by a toe injury suffered with Bristol at the start of October but is fit for selection.

"He progressed back last week and [has had] a full training week this week," said assistant coach Danny Wilson. 

"There are a few boxes left to tick but he is moving in the right direction."

The 24-year-old  switched to American football the following January but returned to rugby this summer on a season-long contract with Bristol.

Rees-Zammit is fighting for selection in the back three with Blair Murray, Josh Adams, Tom Rogers, Rio Dyer and Jacob Beetham.

Even if it is deemed too much of a risk to field him in the XV his presence in the match-day squad would give the Welsh Rugby Union a boost for ticket sales.

The wing will hope to add to his 32 caps against Argentina, Japan and New Zealand but is not available to face world champions South Africa because that fixture is outside World Rugby's official Test window.

Steve Tandy led Ospreys to the Pro12 title in 2012

Wales ended an 18-Test losing streak against Japan in July when Matt Sherratt was interim head coach.

Tandy has taken the reins after leaving his role as defence coach with Scotland and has added Sherratt and Wilson, who was a summer assistant, to his management team.

Former internationals Rhys Patchell, Duncan Jones and Dan Lydiate will also help with the coaching for a tough November schedule.

Wales are ranked 12th in the world and go up against sixth-placed Argentina, second-placed New Zealand and first-placed South Africa along with 13th-placed Japan.

Tandy will be expected to beat the Brave Blossoms with the Pumas appearing to be the most likely Rugby Championship scalp.

Wilson, who left his role as Harlequins boss for the international opportunity, wants to see progress from a new-look squad regardless of results.

"We have talked about that if you close your eyes, you'll eventually see and be able to describe how Wales will play with the identity and game model that we want to create," said the former Dragons, Scarlets and Cardiff coach.

"That takes a little bit of time and there are stepping stones to put in place to build that.

"We want to see positives steps from what we are working on in training. Can we build an identity and style of rugby that is attractive and wins?"

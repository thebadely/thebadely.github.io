Wigan reach 14th Grand Final after beating Leigh

Liam Farrell has been to Old Trafford so often in the past 15 years he could be mistaken for a Manchester United season ticket holder.

Only right now he's much happier than the average Red Devils regular, preparing as he is for a 10th Super League Grand Final of a stellar career when Wigan Warriors take on Hull KR at the 'Theatre of Dreams' on Saturday (18:00 BST).

The regularity, and the odd night of disappointment, have failed to diminish the anticipation and excitement of walking out of the corner tunnel, leading out the side in their pursuit of a hat-trick of successive titles.

"You just hear all the noise, the singer going off, look up high into the stands and see them full, 70,000 people, and it's an amazing feeling," second-row Farrell, 35, told BBC Radio 5 Live.

"Not many people get to do it, it's something I and a lot of the other lads cherish.

"We've already had a look back at memories of some of the other wins we've had and hopefully we can create a few more this weekend."

Highlights: Wigan complete clean sweep with Grand Final victory

Farrell and his team-mates did not need to dust off any old videos to revisit happy memories, given it was just 12 months ago the Warriors squared off against the Robins and won a tight game under the lights.

Bevan French's moment of magic ensured the title stayed in WN5, and crowned a wonderful season with the quadruple of World Club Challenge, Super League, League Leaders' Shield and Challenge Cup.

It means in terms of experience of winning the title within the respective squads, Wigan hold a serious advantage going into Saturday's final.

"We're lucky the younger lads in the squad tasted success last year and the year before," Farrell added.

"The likes of Brad O'Neill and Junior Nsemba, they've had experience in big games, and although they will lean on some of the older lads for knowledge and experience, they're quality players themselves.

"I'd like to think when needed I can help wherever but they're good lads to have around and they're a big part of the group."

How Peters turned Hull KR into treble contenders

As an English literature graduate, head coach Matt Peet is well versed in narrative and storytelling, and as Wigan boss has already written a few blockbuster seasons in the club's folklore.

Since taking over in 2022, silverware has followed in each of the campaigns he has completed with his hometown club, and 2025 can continue that theme at Old Trafford.

Hull KR have already snatched two of Wigan's 2024 prizes in 2025, but conversely the Cherry and Whites can make it a 'three-peat' by denying Rovers a treble in Saturday's showpiece.

"All the games during the season are like lessons along the way and this is the final test," Peet, 41, told BBC Sport.

"It's something you look forward to, and I've always enjoyed exams.

"You learn what you can through the year, try to keep the players motivated and energised, and this week you just let them go and get out of the way."

'We get to make a lot of people proud, and that's what drives us' - Peet

Farrell's excitement and energy at the end of a gruelling season is typical of the spirit and character which runs through Wigan Warriors.

Peet has set a culture, in tandem with coaches Sean O'Loughlin and Tommy Leuluai and the players, which demands effort but also encourages nurture, teamwork and togetherness.

Players eulogise about his methods, and his track record speaks for itself.

"He's very empathetic, he understands people on an individual level, understands people have certain needs and that people want to be cared for in different ways and does that very well," Farrell said.

"He's a leader in a sense of he knows what to deliver to the players, he'll admit when he gets it wrong sometimes but there are a lot of times when he gets it right, he does that more often than not.

"Over the last few years he has put us in some great positions and leads by example all the time so we're very lucky to have him."

While Farrell still jumps at the chance to run out and put his body on the line, he would not go so far as to say he enjoys such brutal ballet as Saturday's Grand Final against Hull KR promises to be.

The talk of the tussle is around keeping error-free, and not letting the Robins take advantage close to the goal-line, while the 'X-factor' on both sides, in French and Rovers half-back Mikey Lewis to name two, is also to be feared.

In his advancing years, weeks like this are savoured, even the media day, as while Wigan may well continue to reach major finals, someday Farrell will be the one to miss out.

"There's not many years left, so it could be the last one," Farrell said. "I treated the others the same way. It could be form, be injury, anything.

"Hopefully it isn't but I'll cherish it as if it is and the only one I've played and give 110% like I did in my first game."

Fifteen years on from that win over St Helens on his first glorious Old Trafford night, the hair might have receded and the joints might be a little creakier, but the smile is just as wide on Grand Final night as it ever was for Farrell.

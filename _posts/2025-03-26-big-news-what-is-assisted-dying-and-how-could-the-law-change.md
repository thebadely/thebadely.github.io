Here’s what you need to know: Labour MP Kim Leadbeater says her bill includes "the strictest safeguards anywhere in the world"

MPs voted in support of a proposal to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales, in November 2024.

Months of detailed scrutiny and further votes in the Commons and Lords are required before the bill could become law.

At present, laws throughout the UK prevent people from asking for medical help to die. 

However, proposed laws to give terminally ill adults the right to choose to end their life have been agreed in the Isle of Man, which is part of the British Isles.

The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, external was introduced by backbench Labour MP Kim Leadbeater.

It proposes giving terminally ill people the right to choose to end their life.

It says that anyone who wants to end their life must: 

be over 18 and live in England and Wales, and have been registered with a GP for at least 12 months

have the mental capacity to make the choice and be deemed to have expressed a clear, settled and informed wish, free from coercion or pressure

be expected to die within six months

make two separate declarations, witnessed and signed, about their wish to die

satisfy two independent doctors that they are eligible - with at least seven days between each assessment

Once a patient's application has been approved, they would then have to wait 14 days before proceeding.

A doctor would prepare the substance being used to end the patient's life, but the person would take it themselves.

The bill defines the co-ordinating doctor as a registered medical practitioner with "training, qualifications and experience" at a level to be specified by the health secretary. It does not say which drug would be used.

It would be illegal to use dishonesty, pressure, or to coerce someone into declaring they want to end their life, with a possible 14-year prison sentence.

Under the original proposals, a High Court judge would have to approve each request to end a life. 

However, Leadbetter suggested a three-person panel comprising a senior legal figure, a psychiatrist and a social worker should oversee applications instead. 

And the MPs reviewing the bill have agreed to adopt this approach. 

The proposal followed concerns the High Court would not have capacity to rule on each individual case. 

However, opponents say the move undermines the bill's safeguards.

Doctors must raise other options to assisted dying, MP says

Many months of activity still lie ahead in the Commons and the Lords, and it is still possible that the bill could fall and not become law at all.

There are 23 MPs on the committee scrutinising the proposed legislation line-by-line. They include 14 supporters - including two ministers - and nine opponents. 

The committee is holding public hearings and taking evidence from experts. It will then propose amendments to the bill.

It is hoped that the committee process will be finished in time for the bill to return to the House of Commons on 25 April.

At that stage, all MPs will have a chance to debate and vote on the changes proposed by the committee.

There would then be more scrutiny in the Commons and the Lords, and further voting. 

Even if the bill cleared all its parliamentary hurdles, MPs had originally been told there would be a period of up to two years before any new law would be implemented. 

However, Leadbeater has proposed doubling this to four years, to allow more time to set up training and systems for what would be an entirely new service.

If everything was ready more quickly, assisted dying could be in place ahead of the deadline, but the BBC understands that some ministers have expressed concern about the possible delay. 

Who are the MPs who will scrutinise the assisted dying bill?

The historic vote saw 330 MPs support the assisted dying bill, and 275 reject it.

MPs were given a free vote on the issue, which meant they could make their own decision rather than follow party instructions. The government is impartial on the issue. 

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer was among those to vote in favour of the bill, as was Chancellor Rachel Reeves.

However, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, Foreign Secretary David Lammy, Health Secretary Wes Streeting and Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood all voted against. 

Most Conservative MPs rejected the bill, including party leader Kemi Badenoch. The former PM Rishi Sunak and former deputy PM Oliver Dowden were among the minority of Tory MPs who supported it. 

When MPs last voted on the issue in 2015, they rejected different proposals by 330 votes to 118, external. 

'Hardest decision of my career': MPs wrestle with assisted dying choice

Assisted dying: How did my MP vote?

A separate bill is under discussion in Scotland.

Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur drafted the Assisted Dying for Terminally Ill Adults (Scotland) Bill. 

If passed by MSPs, eligible applicants would have to:

be resident in Scotland for at least 12 months

be registered with a GP in Scotland

be terminally ill 

have the mental capacity to make the request

The bill is being considered by the health committee, external ahead of an initial vote by MSPs. The first stage of the committee's work is due to be completed by 23 May 2025.

In October 2024, Scottish Health Secretary Neil Gray said the proposed legislation went beyond the limits of Holyrood's powers, and was a matter for Westminster. 

However, McArthur said he was confident the UK and Scottish governments could find a solution if MSPs backed his bill.

'Northern Ireland is being left behind on assisted dying'

The Isle of Man and Jersey are both part of the British Isles but are able to set their own laws. They have each been considering different proposals to allow assisted dying. 

The Isle of Man parliament passed its Assisted Dying Bill on 25 March. The bill will now be sent for Royal Assent, where King Charles will give formal approval for it to become law. 

The scheme could be in place by 2027, and will cover adults who have lived on the island for five years and are expected to die within 12 months. 

Jersey's politicians backed the principle of legalising assisted dying in 2021.

And in May 2024, they approved plans to allow assisted dying for those with a terminal illness "causing unbearable suffering".

Final legislation is currently being written, and once approved, an 18-month implementation period would begin, meaning new rules would take effect in summer 2027 at the earliest.

Guernsey: Request to make assisted dying legal could be made in 2025

Opponents warn that people could be put under pressure to end their lives and want improvements to palliative care instead.

Paralympian and House of Lords crossbencher Baroness Grey-Thompson is a vocal critic.

She told the BBC she is worried about "the impact on vulnerable people, on disabled people, [the risk of] coercive control, and the ability of doctors to make a six-month diagnosis". 

Baroness Grey-Thompson is a long-standing critic of legalising assisted dying

Actor and disability-rights activist Liz Carr, who made BBC One documentary Better Off Dead?, also opposes changing the law.

"Some of us have very real fears based on our lived experience and based on what has happened in other countries where it's legal," she wrote on X.

Dr Gordon Macdonald, from campaign group Care Not Killing, said: "The safest law is the one we currently have.

"This bill is being rushed with indecent haste and ignores the deep-seated problems in the UK's broken and patchy palliative care system."

âPeople will make bad decisions because we donât talk honestly about deathâ

'Palliative care is not good enough - and there's no plan to fix it'

Leadbeater argues the law needs changing because some people "have a horrible, harrowing death", however good their end-of-life or palliative care is.

Cancer patient Nathaniel Dye worked on the bill with Leadbeater. He said it would allow people a death which was "as kind and compassionate as possible".

The Dignity in Dying campaign group said the bill provides the "most detailed, robust proposals" on the issue that "Westminster has ever considered". 

According to chief executive Sarah Wootton, the fact that every year "up to 650 terminally ill people end their own lives, often in lonely and traumatic ways," shows that the status quo is not working. 

Dame Esther Rantzen, who has stage four lung cancer, has joined Dignitas in Switzerland

One of the highest-profile advocates for change is broadcaster Dame Esther Rantzen, who has stage-four lung cancer.  

"All I'm asking for is that we be given the dignity of choice," Dame Esther told BBC News. "If I decide that my own life is not worth living, please may I ask for help to die?"

Both the British Medical Association, external, which represents doctors, and the Royal College of Nursing, external are neutral on the issue.

InDepth: The NHS is spending a fortune giving people a death they don't want

There is some debate over exactly what the various terms mean, external.

However, assisted dying generally refers to a person who is terminally ill receiving lethal drugs from a medical practitioner, which they administer themselves.

Assisted suicide is intentionally helping another person to end their life, including someone who is not terminally ill. That could involve providing lethal medication or helping them travel to another jurisdiction to die. 

Euthanasia is the act of deliberately ending a person's life to relieve suffering in which a lethal drug is administered by a physician. Patients may not be terminally ill. 

There are two types: voluntary euthanasia, where a patient consents; and non-voluntary, where they cannot because, for example, they are in a coma. 

The Dignity in Dying campaign group says more than 200 million people around the world have legal access to assisted dying, external. 

Switzerland has allowed assisted suicide since 1942. Its Dignitas facility accepts foreign patients as well as Swiss nationals, and between 1998 and 2023 it helped 571 Britons to die, external. 

Assisted suicide is also legal in Austria.

In the US, 10 states - Oregon, California, New Mexico, Colorado, Washington, Hawaii, New Jersey, Vermont, Maine and Washington DC - allow "physician-assisted dying".

It permits doctors to prescribe lethal drugs for self-administration. 

Voluntary euthanasia is legal in Canada, where it is called medical assistance in dying. It can be provided by a doctor or nurse practitioner, either in person or through the prescription of drugs for self-administration. Medically assisted dying accounted for 4.7% of deaths in Canada in 2023.

It is also legal in Spain and Colombia, both of which also permit assisted suicide.

Assisted dying is legal in some parts of Australia, but the law differs across states.

New Zealand's End of Life Choice Act legalises assisted dying and allows adults in their final months of life to request assistance from a medical professional. 

Three countries have laws that allow people who are not terminally ill to receive assistance to die: The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg.

How does assisted dying work in other countries?

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Daria Kasatkina is a former world number eight in singles

World number 19 Daria Kasatkina says she is at "breaking point" and has ended her season early, describing the schedule as "too much, mentally and emotionally".

The 28-year-old switched nationality from Russia to Australia in March, having criticised her country's LGBTQ+ laws and the war in Ukraine.

She struggled for form this year, failing to win a title and finishing with a 19-21 record.

Kasatkina said the emotional stress of her nationality switch contributed to her struggles, including not seeing her father for four years.

"I've been far from fine for a long time and, truth be told, my results and performances show that," she wrote in a lengthy statement., external

"I am at breaking point and sadly I am not alone.

"Add in to the mix the emotional and mental stress related to my nationality switch and there is only so much I can deal with and take as an individual woman.

"If this makes me weak, then so be it, I'm weak.

"However, I know I am strong and will get stronger by being away and recharging.

"It's time I listened to myself for a change."

Former top-five players Elina Svitolina and Paula Badosa ended their seasons early in recent weeks.

Ukraine's Svitolina said she had "not been feeling like myself", while Badosa has spoken about the mental toll of an ongoing back problem.

Other players have also spoken about the impact of the tennis calendar.

Five players retired injured in two tournaments in China last week, with six-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek saying the season is too long and intense.

The Women's Tennis Association (WTA) has made it mandatory for top players to participate in each Grand Slam, 10 WTA 1000 events and six 500-level tournaments.

Players can skip mandatory events if they injured or have personal reasons, but they will receive no rankings points or prize money if they do not play.

Former world number one Novak Djokovic, who has slimmed down his schedule in recent years to protect his body, has called on players to be more united, external in forcing change.

Let's dive into the details: The Financial Times is among those leading on the scandal involving PPE Medpro over the supply of medical equipment during the pandemic. The paper says the government could struggle to recoup the £122m payment ordered by the court, as the company's latest accounts show net assets of £666,000. 

The Daily Mail described the ruling as a "crushing defeat in the High Court" for Baroness Mone, who is linked to the company through her husband Doug Barrowman. The Daily Mirror quotes a group of families who lost relatives to Covid, calling for the baroness to lose her title.

The Mail says Scotland Yard has been left reeling by a new scandal after the BBC's investigation into racism and sexism in Britian's biggest police force. Sir Mark Rowley said the officers responsible would be put on a path to "likely dismissal".

The Daily Express leads on the sentencing of the Rochdale grooming gang ringleader, Mohammed Zahid, to 35 years in prison. It describes the "fury" of an ex-Manchester police detective at the long wait for justice. Writing to the paper, a solicitor compares the grooming gangs to "mafia organisations".

The i Paper highlights the government's plans to remove the automatic right of refugees to bring family members to the UK once they have been granted asylum. A government source tells the paper the Home Office is prepared to be "radical" when it comes to stopping small boats. The Daily Telegraph also quotes an anonymous government source as saying the UK has been "overly generous" and wants to reduce "pull factors" for asylum seekers.

And several papers feature photographs of the late Dame Jane Goodall. The Times calls her work with chimpanzees "groundbreaking". 

In its obituary, The Guardian describes her a "pioneer", not just for her work with primates but for pursuing science as a woman in the 1960s. In its editorial column, the Express says the natural world has lost one of its most tenacious and effective defenders.

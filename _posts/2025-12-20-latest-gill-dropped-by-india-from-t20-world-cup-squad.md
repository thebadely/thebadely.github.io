Here’s what you need to know: Gill led India in a drawn 2-2 Test series in England during the summer 

India have dropped Test and one-day international captain Shubman Gill from their 15-man squad for the men's T20 World Cup.

The 26-year-old's omission follows him scoring 291 in his 15 T20 matches in 2025, with India's chief selector Ajit Agarkar saying the batter was "short of runs at the moment".

Gill missed the T20 international against South Africa on Friday as India won the match to claim a 3-1 series victory.

Suryakumar Yadav scored five runs in that game and, despite his tally of 218 runs in his 19 T20 outings this year, he retained the captaincy.

"We have full faith in our captain to deliver during the World Cup," said Agarkar.

Suryakumar said: "I know what to do. I have time to fix it. We will definitely see Surya the batter."

India, who are defending champions, will host the T20 World Cup with Sri Lanka from 7 February to 8 March.

India are in the same group as Namibia, Netherlands, Pakistan and USA.

Suryakumar Yadav (capt), Axar Patel (vice-capt) Abhishek Sharma, Sanju Samson, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Rinku Singh, Jasprit Bumrah, Harshit Rana, Arshdeep Singh, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakaravarthy, Washington Sundar, Ishan Kishan

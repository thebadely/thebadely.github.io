Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Japan's Hayato Katsuki made the first podium of the World Championships in Tokyo, finishing third in the men's 35km race walk

Japan celebrated the return to Tokyo of a premier global sporting event with a medal in a curtain-raising 35km race walk contested in gruelling conditions at the World Athletics Championships.

Despite the road race start times being moved 30 minutes earlier than scheduled, in anticipation of the heat over the opening weekend in the Japanese capital, temperatures still climbed to 30C over the course of the first morning session.

That was accompanied by stifling humidity above 90%. Canadian men's 35km race walk winner Evan Dunfee described the race - which for him lasted almost two and a half hours - as "absolutely brutal".

Four years after Tokyo hosted the postponed 2020 Olympics behind closed doors because of the coronavirus pandemic, home athlete Hayato Katsuki held on to a podium place to the delight of those watching the finish inside Japan's National Stadium on Saturday morning.

With the streets outside also lined by enthusiastic supporters as the nine-day championships began, it marked a poignant moment for the host nation after it was denied the opportunity to cheer on its athletes at the same location for its Games.

That is a lost opportunity for which the people of Japan intend to make up for over the next nine days, with close to 500,000 tickets sold and some night sessions completely sold out according to World Athletics president Lord Coe.

While grey clouds protected athletes somewhat from the searing heat which has led to Japan experiencing its warmest summer on record, the athletes still had to endure extremely challenging conditions.

Several competitors in the race walk events were seen feeling the effects during and after completing 16 laps of a 2km road loop between starting and finishing on the track.

Britain's Cameron Curbishley, the 34th and final finisher in the 50-strong men's race, told BBC Sport: "That was definitely the hardest race I have ever done. It was just a mission to finish, it was tough from the start. 

"To get through it is something I can be really proud of. The humidity just makes it so hard on your body, I just really suffered.

"I tried to use the motivation of seeing other people slowing down and dropping out to just take it one lap at a time and try and catch anyone with the little energy that I had."

Medical help was readily available for any athletes requiring assistance

Bronze medallist Katsuki's compatriot Masatora Kawano at one stage led the men's race as Japan temporarily held the top two positions, but he succumbed to the conditions. 

Kawano was able to complete the race and receive the adoration of his home support on his closing lap of the track, but there was concern for the 26-year-old after he collapsed to the ground upon crossing the finish line and had to be assisted off the track in a wheelchair.

Spain's men's competitors still had the strength to lift compatriot Maria Perez on their shoulders after she dominated the women's event.

Conditions are only expected to get tougher over the coming days, with a heatwave expected from Sunday until Thursday when temperatures are forecast to rise into the mid-30s.

The women's marathon on Sunday and men's marathon on Monday, the latter featuring Great Britain's Emile Cairess, have both also been brought forward by half an hour to 07:30 local time (23:30 BST) due to health and safety concerns.

On the eve of the championships, the president of Japan Athletics became emotional when discussing the significance of these championships for Tokyo and the nation.

Yuko Arimori, a former marathon runner, said the return of a global sporting event to the city had the potential to "wipe away" the memories of empty seats at the Olympics.

 "Sport isn't just about the athletes but about everyone getting energy from it and lifting each other up, and I think that kind of energy is important," she said.

"I think this event will help us wipe away the emotions we felt back then and remind us what sport should be like. Athletics is the mother of sports and I want people to take inspiration from it."

Groups of school children were present and contributed to a lively atmosphere inside the stadium for the opening session - well attended although far from full - where the preliminary rounds of the 100m were among the highlights.

Hoping to star when he enters the competition in Saturday night's heats, Olympic and world champion Noah Lyles said in the lead-up: "I want to see a crowd. I was really sad to not have the crowds there in 2021.

"But I know they're as energetic and excited as we are, so when we get together we're going to hopefully make fireworks."

Athletics' return to Tokyo means, fittingly, that the event in the Japanese capital bookends a five-year run of major championships - a situation caused by the pandemic and subsequent postponements.

With each sighting of the bright orange Japanese vest cheered loudly - not least when the team united for mixed 4x400m relay qualifying - the early signs suggest the host nation is keen to make up for lost time.

Great Britain qualified for Saturday's mixed 4x400m final second-fastest behind the United States, while Scott Lincoln became the first British man to make the world shot put final since 2009.

Scorecard, Table

England avoided a shock defeat by Pakistan at the Women's World Cup, being saved by heavy rain in Colombo.

An inspired bowling performance from Pakistan saw England slump to 79-7 after 25 overs before the first heavy downpour began.

After a lengthy delay, the rain eased and play resumed at 31 overs per side, with England posting 133-9 after a useful stand of 47 between Charlie Dean, who top-scored with 33, and Em Arlott. 

Pakistan were set a revised target of 113 and made a promising start by reaching 34-0 before the rain resumed and denied them a historic victory, which would have been their first one-day international win over England.

It was a fortunate escape for England who suffered their second batting scare of the tournament, after they recovered from 78-5 to beat Bangladesh, and a big wake-up call before their toughest challenges against India and Australia which come next.

Nat Sciver-Brunt's side were outplayed by Pakistan, who are winless in the tournament so far, as five wickets fell in the powerplay, including another failure for the opening partnership. Tammy Beaumont was the first to fall, bowled after leaving a superb delivery from Diana Baig which nipped back sharply.

Pakistan skipper Fatima Sana then starred with three wickets, bowling Amy Jones for eight, before claiming the two vital scalps of Nat Sciver-Brunt and Heather Knight, bowled and lbw for four and 18 respectively.

Without their two most experienced players, England were exposed and caught between attack and defence.

Sophia Dunkley and Alice Capsey were lbw sweeping and Emma Lamb's struggles at number six continued as she was bowled by spinner Sadia Iqbal for four.

Capsey and Charlie Dean withstood Pakistan's array of spinners for 70 balls but only added 21 runs before the pressure told on the former, but Dean was proactive once play resumed by adding valuable runs with Arlott. 

Pakistan openers Omaima Sohail and Muneeba Ali were confident at the beginning of their reply and England were sloppy with the ball, but it is another heartbreak for them having reduced defending champions Australia to 76-7 before that game also slipped from their grasp.

England now travel to Indore to face India and Australia before they conclude the group stage against New Zealand in Visakhapatnam, where flatter pitches are expected at both venues.

They will be hopeful Sophie Ecclestone and Lauren Bell, who were left out of the XI in Colombo for Sarah Glenn and Em Arlott, will recover from illness in time.

'Where on earth do they go from here?' - England's wicket woe

England captain Nat Sciver-Brunt: "Pakistan bowled brilliantly. Diana Baig and Fatima Sana made it really hard for us to get into the game at all.

"Em Arlott and Charlie Dean then batted really well to give us a chance but we weren't good enough today and we will hold our hands up. The conditions had also changed a lot by the time the ball was in our hands.

"Adapting as quickly as possible was important. The wicket was seaming a lot so we needed to put in plans to nullify that threat. Picking up wickets as well stopped us getting a partnership at all."

Pakistan captain Fatima Sana: "Obviously today showed we can beat them but it was not in our favour.

"They [her team] are very aware of the conditions. We knew this pitch is good for the pacers. I saw a lot of performances before on this track so knew this pitch was good for fast bowlers so tried to bowl on a good length."

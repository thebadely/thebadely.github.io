Experts revealed that Omari Hutchinson and James McAtee won Euro 2025 together with England Under-21s in the summer

Nottingham Forest have agreed deals worth Â£37.5m for Ipswich Town winger Omari Hutchinson and nearly Â£30m for Manchester City's James McAtee.

The deal for 22-year-old McAtee is also expected to include a sell-on and buy-back clause. 

Forest had been considering their next move for Hutchinson, 21, after a Â£35m offer was rejected by the Tractor Boys at the weekend. 

Midfielder McAtee, who captained England Under-21s to Euro 2025 victory in the summer, has been a long-term target for Forest.

He made 27 appearances for City last season but just three Premier League starts.

Forest are also in advanced talks for Rennes striker Arnaud Kalimuendo before Sunday's Premier League opener at home to Brentford, with all three deals worth close to Â£90m. 

The club have been looking for wide reinforcements, having sold Anthony Elanga to Newcastle for a club-record deal of an initial Â£55m, external, and have already signed Dan Ndoye from Bologna. 

Brentford also had a Â£35m bid turned down last month for Hutchinson, despite the offer meeting his relegation release clause. 

Since the offer was not cash up front, though, it was rejected and the clause expired. 

The Bees did come back to the table after selling Bryan Mbeumo to Manchester United, but were unable to agree a deal with Ipswich, leaving Forest in pole position to bring him to the City Ground. 

Hutchinson - who scored in England Under-21's extra-time final victory against Germany in June after being set up by McAtee - joined Town from Chelsea for Â£20m last summer after spending 2023-24 on loan at Portman Road, helping Ipswich into the Premier League.

He scored three goals in 31 league games last season but was unable to stop Kieran McKenna's side dropping back into the Championship.

Ipswich, who drew their opening Championship game 1-1 at Birmingham, also sold striker Liam Delap to Chelsea in a Â£30m deal after he scored 12 goals last season.

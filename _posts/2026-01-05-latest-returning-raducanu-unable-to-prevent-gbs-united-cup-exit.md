It has been recently reported that Emma Raducanu missed Great Britain's opening United Cup match because of a long-standing foot injury

Emma Raducanu lost on her return from a foot injury as Great Britain were eliminated from the United Cup with a group-stage defeat by Greece.

Raducanu, 23, had not played since early October after what she described as "light bone bruising" on her right foot and pulled out of her anticipated season-opening match against Japan's Naomi Osaka on Sunday due to the same issue.

With the decision deemed to be precautionary, Raducanu returned to court on Monday for a tie in which victory would have secured Britain's place in the quarter-finals.

There were encouraging signs for Raducanu in a 6-3 3-6 6-1 defeat by Greece's Maria Sakkari - moving freely in a thorough workout, often striking the ball with quality and showing fighting spirit to level the match.

But the British number one understandably showed some rustiness before running out of steam in a physical contest.

"I started hitting two weeks ago, so it's been a good two and a bit months where I didn't play," Raducanu said.

"Being able to produce that, having not played, is just giving me confidence to what I can do when I do practise more. 

"I know now I just need to get my head down and keep working."

Britain missed the chance to win Group E in the mixed team event as Raducanu followed Billy Harris in losing singles matches which could have gone either way.

Olivia Nicholls and Neal Skupski claimed a consolation 6-2 3-6 10-4 victory in the mixed doubles against Despina Papamichail and Stefanos Sakellaridis.

Raducanu is ranked 29th in the world after an encouraging 2025 season, but the foot issue has failed to alleviate concerns about the brittle nature of her body.

Breaking 51st-ranked Sakkari's serve in the first game was the perfect start on her return and the 2021 US Open champion's movement appeared to be uninhibited when she pushed off her right foot into the forehand side.

While her ball-striking was often crisp and damaging, Raducanu did not find the same consistency from the baseline as her opponent.

The Greek former world number three turned the early deficit around and claimed the first set by winning six of the final seven games, then held off four break points in the second game of the second set before taking Raducanu's serve for a 2-1 lead.

Raducanu, though, has developed more resilience over the past 12 months, showing that determination again as she fought back to level the match.

However, her level dipped sharply in the decider. Sakkari - who had lost all four of their previous meetings - quickly rattled off the final five games with little resistance from Raducanu.

Raducanu is scheduled to play a WTA event in Hobart next week before the Australian Open - where she is on course to be seeded - begins on 18 January.

Earlier, Harris came agonisingly close to securing the most notable victory of his career before falling 6-4 1-6 7-6 (7-4) to two-time Grand Slam finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas.

The British number five pushed Tsitsipas all the way in an intense contest but the former world number three - who has fallen to 34th in the rankings after struggling for form and fitness - showed his mettle to come through.

Harris, 30, played at a level much higher than his ranking as he moved two points from victory at 6-5, but Tsitsipas recovered from 0-30 to hold and his vast experience showed in a tie-break which 127th-ranked Harris started with a double fault.

"I got fed up of losing matches like that so I tried everything in my power not to let it happen again. I'm grateful for coming through that," said Tsitsipas.

"Billy put out an incredible performance, I haven't played such a high-quality match in a long time. he did great to push me to my limit."

World number four Coco Gauff was undone by 14 double faults and 54 unforced errors as she fell to a surprise singles defeat - but recovered in the doubles to help the United States beat Spain to reach the quarter-finals.

Gauff lost 6-1 6-7 (3-7) 6-0 to 42nd-ranked Jessica Bouzas Maneiro as the two-time major champion's nine-match unbeaten streak in the United Cup - winning six singles matches and all three of her doubles contests - came to an end.

A first top-five victory for Bouzas Maneiro gave Spain a 1-0 lead before Taylor Fritz levelled the tie after saving a match point against Jaume Munar in the men's singles match.

Gauff returned alongside Christian Harrison for the mixed doubles, beating Inigo Cervantes and Yvonne Cavalle 7-6 (7-5) 6-0 to ensure the defending champions topped Group A.

In Group F, world number three Alexander Zverev suffered a surprise defeat as Germany were beaten by Poland.

Zverev lost 6-3 6-4 to former top-10 player Hubert Hurkacz, who was playing his first competitive match since June.

Hurkacz, who has dropped to 83rd in the rankings since suffering a knee injury seven months ago, triumphed to give Poland a 1-0 lead in Sydney.

Six-time major champion Iga Swiatek secured victory for Poland, although she had to fight back from a set down to avoid a shock defeat against Eva Lys.

Lys had never won a set in her three previous encounters against the world number two, but could not sustain her level in a 3-6 6-3 6-4 defeat.

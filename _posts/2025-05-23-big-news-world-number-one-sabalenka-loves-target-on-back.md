World number one Aryna Sabalenka says she "loves" having a target on her back as she goes into the French Open women's singles as the player to beat.

Sabalenka has stretched her lead at the top of the rankings after a commanding start to 2025.

The 27-year-old Belarusian has won two WTA 1000 titles in Miami and Madrid, as well as reaching three other finals at the Australian Open, Indian Wells and Stuttgart.

It means the three-time major winner comes into the French Open, where she is looking to better her career-best run to the 2023 semi-finals, as many people's favourite for the title.

Sabalenka's hand appears to have been strengthened by three-time defending champion Iga Swiatek's struggles on the clay this season.

"Knowing there is someone chasing me or having a target on my back right now, I love it. I take it as a challenge," Sabalenka said.

"Every time I go out there, I feel like 'OK, let's go'. Let's see who is ready for the pressure moments.

"It's actually helping me to stay in the moment and fight, no matter what, on the court."

Sabalenka lost to Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva in last year's quarter-finals after being hampered by a stomach bug.

"I'll definitely not be going to go for the same meal I had before that match. The lesson is learned," Sabalenka joked on Friday.

Sabalenka, who has won two Australian Opens and one US Open, starts her bid against Russia's Kamilla Rakhimova on Sunday.

Sabalenka has been put in the same half of the draw as Polish fifth seed Swiatek - meaning they could meet in the semi-finals.

Four-time winner Swiatek has not been seeded so low in Paris since 2021, having become known as the 'Queen of Clay' because of her formidable record on the surface.

After losing to Danielle Collins in the Rome third round, the 23-year-old was downbeat about her form and did not rate her chances of bouncing back at Roland Garros.

However, she appears to have changed her mindset after taking a week off to reflect.

"I had a lot of time to think about how I played and what my attitude was," said Swiatek, who starts against Slovakia's Rebecca Sramkova and could play Britain's Emma Raducanu in the second round.

"I focused on changing some stuff, and also having more intensity, because I feel like I'm not starting the match well.

"I got to the point where I knew I needed to change something in my attitude and maybe get a little bit more energetic before the matches."

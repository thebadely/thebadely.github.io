Britain's Alfie Hewett won two matches in a day as he started with victory in his singles quarter-final before he and Gordon Reid reached the Wimbledon doubles final to stay on course for a third successive title.

Hewett won both titles last year and is on course to repeat that, beginning Thursday with a comfortable win against Zhenxu Ji of China 6-1 6-1 to reach the last four.

He and Reid then rounded off the day with an impressive fightback from a set down to beat Spain's Daniel Caverzaschi and Tokito Oda of Japan 3-6 6-4 6-0.

The win puts the British pair a step closer to a 24th Grand Slam title and a seventh at Wimbledon. 

The top seeds will face second seeds Martin de la Puente and Ruben Spaargaren in the final.

There was even the potential for the two to meet on the opposite sides of the net in the singles final, but Reid lost his match 6-2 6-3 to fourth seed Gustavo Fernandez of Argentina.

Hewett and Reid through to doubles semi-finals

World number two Hewett is looking to lift an 11th major singles title and is looking in good form as he breezed through the quarter-final.

His movement on court three and accuracy of his shots were too much for Zhenxu, though he twice saved break points in the opening game but then won the next 11 points to move into a 3-0 lead.

The Briton continued to dominate and looked on course to win the opener without losing a game, but Zhenxu got off the mark in the sixth game before Hewett closed out the set.

Hewett broke early again in set two, setting the tone for the remainder of the match as he swiftly wrapped his progress into the last four.

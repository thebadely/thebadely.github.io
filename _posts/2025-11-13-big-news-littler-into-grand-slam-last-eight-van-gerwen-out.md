Let's dive into the details: Littler won the PDC World Championship in January

Defending champion Luke Littler maintained his hopes of becoming world number one with a dominant win against Wessel Nijman in the last 16 of the Grand Slam of Darts, as Michael van Gerwen was knocked out.

Littler, who would usurp Luke Humphries, external at the top of the rankings if he reaches the final in Wolverhampton, raced into a 5-0 lead before his Dutch opponent got on the scoreboard.

Nijman reduced his deficit to 6-3 but, after missing three darts at a double to move two legs behind, found himself 7-3 down.

World champion Littler went on to win 10-4, finishing with an average of 105.38, and will play Josh Rock in the quarter-finals.   

"I have my eyes on everything," Littler told Sky Sports. "The title, world number one - if I get to the final I'm world number one - but we've just got to take it game by game."

Three-time champion Van Gerwen faced fellow Dutchman Danny Noppert and both finished with 170 checkouts in the first and third legs respectively in a fast start.

Van Gerwen was doing the chasing for most of the match and kept himself within range before his compatriot took three legs in a row to move 9-5 in front before winning 10-6.

Rock, who won the World Cup of Darts for Northern Ireland along with Daryl Gurney in June, held off Connor Scutt to earn a narrow 10-9 victory. 

Rock held leads of 3-0 and 8-5 but Scutt battled back to force a decider, which the Irishman - with the throw - took to progress into the last eight. 

In an all-German match, Lukas Wenig came through a closely fought encounter against Niko Springer, winning 10-8.

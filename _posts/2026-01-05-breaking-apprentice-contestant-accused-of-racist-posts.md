It has been recently reported that A former contestant on TV show The Apprentice sent a string of antisemitic, racist and sexist posts on social media, a medical tribunal has been told.

Dr Asif Munaf, who is from Sheffield, is said to have posted and reposted the "seriously offensive" comments from his X account on various dates between October 2023 and July 2025.

He appeared on the 2024 edition of The Apprentice but was dropped from The Apprentice: You're Fired! after he was accused of posting antisemitic comments on social media.

The 37-year-old, who has not attended the tribunal and is not legally represented, denied the posts were antisemitic at a previous hearing.

On Monday the General Medical Council (GMC) outlined the misconduct allegations against the doctor, who is registered under his full name Mohammed Asif Munaf.

According to the GMC, Munaf posted multiple antisemitic statements, including Holocaust denial, conspiracy theories and rhetoric equating Jews with Nazism.

Harriet Tighe, lawyer for the GMC, said one post was accompanied by an image of a flag including the Star of David above a swastika.

Munaf also reposted a comment which referred to boxer Floyd Mayweather using a derogatory racial slur.

In a separate post, Munaf expressed sexist views, arguing that certain professions should be restricted by gender and criticised female empowerment.

At a previous hearing, he said the posts were "not befitting of someone as educated as myself and were said in the heat of the emotion".

He is also accused by the GMC of "disappearing" just hours into a locum placement as a cardiology specialist registrar at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust in January 2024 as he walked out without notice or good reason.

In a separate allegation, he is said to have provided a sick note to a patient in November 2024 while he was suspended from practice.

The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service hearing continues.

Let's dive into the details: The men's final attracted more than eight million views across TV and online

Wimbledon attracted a record-breaking 69.3 million digital video views for BBC Sport over the two-week competition.

Audiences viewed the matches through BBC iPlayer, the BBC Sport website and the BBC Sport app.

It is a considerable increase from the 50.1 million online requests in 2024, which had previously dropped from 54.3 million in 2023.

The men's singles final between rivals Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner had a peak TV and online audience of 8.8 million, with nearly all - 8.3 million - watching on BBC One.

In the women's final, 4.1 million tuned into BBC One to watch Iga Swiatek win her first Wimbledon title with a commanding victory over Amanda Anisimova.

Alex Kay-Jelski, director of BBC Sport, said: "This year's record-breaking digital figures for Wimbledon are testament to the huge appeal of the sport among audiences and the power of digital innovation to bring both new and existing fans closer to the action than ever before.

"The way people are following Wimbledon is changing but that is exciting for us as we look to tell the best stories in different ways."

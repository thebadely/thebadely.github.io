Experts revealed that A seven-year-old fundraiser has been praised by the charity after she helped raise £2,500.

Ophelia has been supporting the food poverty charity Caring Cooks - which works to make sure no child or family in Jersey goes hungry through donations and education - for about 18 months.

She has given up her birthday money as well as organised events and fundraisers.

Yvonne Corbin, from Caring Cooks, said Ophelia is "incredible" and "brought awareness to how important charity work is" to other children.

She was moved when Ophelia first started her work for the charity.

Ms Corbin said "her mum came to me and said her little girl wanted to donate her birthday money to the charity" and "everything is off of her own back and comes up with her own ideas".

Ms Corbin added: "Ophelia has brought life to the charity because she's got children involved in our work and she's just adorable."

Ophelia's father Adrian Goldsborough said "it's been fantastic" and "I don't think Ophelia understands how her actions have helped so many".

"Hopefully her actions can encourage more children to help more charities like Caring Cooks," he added.

Ophelia has been shortlisted for the BBC Radio Jersey Make a Difference Awards.

She said volunteering "makes me happy because I'm helping other people" and she wants to keep up the work "so other people do it".

The winner of the awards is due to be announced on Friday.

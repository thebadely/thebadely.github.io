Scorecard

Scotland's bowlers secured a narrow victory over the Netherlands and boosted hopes of T20 World Cup qualification.

The Scots won the toss and batted first but George Munsey was caught by Noah Croes off the third ball of the day.

Brandon McMullen, Michael Leask, Matthew Cross, Mark Watt and Safyaan Sharif also fell quickly to the Dutch bowlers.

Oli Hairs' 52 offered some resistance and Richie Berrington (28) and Charlie Tear (32) also chipped in to help Scotland post 148-9.

McMullen took the wickets of Max O'Dowd and Zach Lion-Cachet early in the Netherlands' innings and Sharif bowled Michael Levitt for 22.

Chris Greaves added the wickets of Scott Edwards, Bas de Leede, who went lbw, and Teja Nidamanuru.

With overs running out, Brad Currie bowled Roelof van der Merwe for 20 and Croes and Aryan Dutt were respectively 52 and six not out as Scotland triumphed by six runs.

Doug Watson's side move on to one win and one draw from two matches after their opening match with Guernsey was rained off. The Scots' next opponents Italy have the same record while Jersey have three points from three matches. The top two will progress to next year's World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.

Scotland face Italy on Wednesday before meeting Jersey two days later.

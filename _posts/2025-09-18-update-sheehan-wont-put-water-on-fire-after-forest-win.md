'It's never over till it's over' - Sheehan on late Forest win

Alan Sheehan says Swansea City have every right to believe again, as their Premier League scalp of Nottingham Forest showed their promise is more than just stars in the boardroom.

Swansea's introduction of Croatia great Luka Modric and rap star Snoop Dogg into their ownership structure has seen the Championship club back in the spotlight.

And their summer spending â their most expensive outlay since relegation from the Premier League in 2018 â has seen hope of a return to the top-flight flicker back into life.

It smouldered even further amid the south Wales rain as they humbled Ange Postecoglou and knocked Forest out of the EFL Cup to reach the last-16 for the first time since they themselves were a top-level club.

So asked whether he was prepared to deal with new expectation levels for a club that have failed to even threaten the Championship play-offs for the past four seasons, Sheehan said: "I'm not one to put water on the fire â I'm probably more a guy who puts petrol on it.

"I'm not going to dampen what people want to believe because I won't shy away from it. We want to improve on last year.

"We're building something, I do believe that."

Sheehan - appointed Swansea's permanent boss in the summer after a profitable spell as caretaker - said the dramatic injury-time win ranked among the best moments he has experienced in his short time as a boss.

He says Swansea are evolving in particular off the ball as they held on at times against Forest, whose own manager Ange Postecoglou admitted he sensed signs of complacency from his side after they took a two-goal lead.

And the Welsh club are far from the finished article, as shown when they threw away chance of victory against Hull City at the weekend.

"We had a good debrief the day after Hull, about what our mentality has to be like to get where we want to get to," Sheehan said.

"For us to get to the very end in this game, I'm incredibly proud. 

"They deserve that moment, when you're brave and you go after a team like that with no fear, sometimes you get the rewards."

As they prepare to face another side with plenty of ambition this weekend in Birmingham City, Swansea will hope that those rewards extend beyond a one-off Premier League scalp.

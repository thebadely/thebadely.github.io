According to new developments, Andy Robertson described Diogo Jota (left) as one of his "closest mates"

Andy Robertson says he and his Liverpool team-mates will "probably never get over" Diogo Jota's death.

The Liverpool and Portugal forward, 28, and his brother Andre Silva were killed in a car crash in July.

"I don't think anyone could care less about football when things like that happen," said Scotland captain Robertson.

"Such a shock. Devastating for his family first and foremost but obviously devastating for us as a group of lads.

"It puts life into perspective as to what's important - spending time with your family, spending time with your kids, because you never know what's around the corner."

With his starting place no longer assured, left-back Robertson had chosen to stay on at Anfield before Jota's death and explained he felt a strong responsibility to help others as an experienced member of the squad.

"It's the toughest thing we'll ever go through," he added. "Losing one of your closest mates for me was hugely difficult and it's something we'll probably never get over but it's just something that we have to carry with us.

"We have to carry the memories we've got with us and as long as we continue to do that, then it'll always be in our thoughts. He will always be in our hearts.

"It didn't influence my decision. The decision was already made before the tragedy but I knew in that moment that the club needed me.

"I know I am one of the leaders in the team and I have obviously been made vice-captain now.

"It's going to take a lot this season. I know football was irrelevant but if you take the football out of it, even as lads in the changing room, we are all going to need help during the season.

"We've already had difficult moments in terms of the first time in front of fans, having to go to your team-mate's funeral which is absolute madness to even say, and everything else that followed.

"I know the leaders in that changing room have got a big job to do in terms of trying to help everyone as a club and even Diogo's family through this massively difficult moment.

"It won't get easier but maybe we can numb the pain a little bit as time goes on. It's up to as leaders to try and guide us guide us through that."

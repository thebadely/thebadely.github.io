It has been recently reported that Saim Ayub will be among Pakistan's team at the T20 World Cup

Pakistan will take part in this month's men's T20 World Cup - but will not play their scheduled match against tournament co-hosts India.

The country had been considering boycotting the competition after Bangladesh withdrew citing safety fears over travelling to India.

Political tensions have meant Pakistan and India have not faced each other outside men's major tournaments since 2013, while India have not played in Pakistan since 2008.

The sides are scheduled to play in Colombo, Sri Lanka, in accordance with an agreement signed last year stating that the two countries will play at neutral venues whenever one of them hosts an ICC event.

In a statement, the Pakistan government said it "grants approval" to their team's  participation, but added "[the] Pakistan Cricket Team shall not take the field in the match scheduled on 15th February 2026 against India".

However the International Cricket Council (ICC), which governs the sport, said Pakistan's stance was "difficult to reconcile" and called on the country's cricket chiefs to explore a "mutually acceptable resolution".

In a statement, it said it was awaiting official communication from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) but said "this position of selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule.

"Selective participation undermines the spirit and sanctity of the competitions."

It said it "respects the roles of governments in matters of national policy" but continued: "This decision is not in the interest of the global game or the welfare of fans worldwide, including millions in Pakistan."

It added that it hoped the PCB "will consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country" and that it "expects the PCB to explore a mutually acceptable resolution".

The ICC has yet to publish its playing conditions for the tournament so it is not known what sanction Pakistan could face for boycotting the game.

However, the rules for the previous tournament stated: "If the match is decided by one side conceding defeat or refusing to play, the result shall be stated as Match Conceded or Match Awarded, as the case may be."

Pakistan had previously announced their squad for the 20-team tournament, which begins on 7 February, but maintained participation was subject to government approval.

The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB), meanwhile, had asked for their fixtures to be switched from India to the other host nation, Sri Lanka.

But that call was rejected by the ICC last month with the organisation saying there was an "absence of any credible security threat".

The BCB then withdrew with Scotland replacing them in the tournament.

Alongside India, Pakistan have been placed with Namibia, Netherlands and the USA in Group A.

They will go into the tournament having defeated Australia by 111 runs on Sunday to complete a 3-0 T20 series sweep.

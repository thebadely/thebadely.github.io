Let's dive into the details: Ralphie Albert has signed his first professional contract with Surrey

The young Ralphie Albert did not know why people would stop his grandad in the street.

Maybe just for a chat or possibly an autograph. Probably a selfie. It's usually a selfie these days, right?

Albert's grandad is the snooker legend Jimmy White. A six-time World Championship finalist, the Whirlwind is one of the most popular players to ever draw back a cue.

Now the 17-year-old Albert, the son of White's daughter Lauren, is growing the family sporting legacy, signing his first professional contract with Surrey.

"Mum used to say 'one day you'll understand how famous he is'," Albert tells BBC Sport. "People would go up to him in the street and I couldn't understand what was happening because I just knew him as my grandad.

"It still happens today. We were in the train station going to The Oval to watch the cricket, and maybe three or four people came up to him. I was laughing because I don't understand how big he is."

The signing of a multi-year deal at The Oval, a week short of his 18th birthday, is the latest step in a year of progress for Albert.

A left-arm spin-bowling all-rounder, he was first named in an England Under-19s squad as a 16-year-old last September. 

He eventually made his debut for the national age-group side against a strong India team in June. Playing alongside Rocky Flintoff and Thomas Rew, he took 10 wickets in the second 'Test' in July.

In his second one-day game for Surrey, against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in August, Albert made 96 batting at number seven.

He returned to school at Epsom College in September, only to be called up for a first-class debut on a spinning pitch in Southampton as Surrey looked for a win against Hampshire that might have given them a fourth successive County Championship.

Albert took two crucial wickets and made a priceless 63 in the second innings, against an attack including India off-spinner Washington Sundar. Surrey won, but it was not enough to deny Nottinghamshire the title. This winter he will once again link up with the under-19s on their tour of the Caribbean, then possibly for the World Cup in the new year.

Clearly the cricket career is full of promise, but the snooker talent has not been passed on. Albert says tackling the baize is "impossible", though that does not mean he cannot draw on his grandad's experience as a world-class sportsman.

"You have to be pretty mentally strong in both sports," says Albert. "They're over a long period of time and one error can mess your whole game up.

"He just gives me advice across the whole mental side, how to be a good sportsperson and manage your game, expectation and stay in the moment.

"Ever since I was young he'd ask me the same thing: 'How much are you giving it?'

"'I'd say 100%, and then he'd say 'yeah, right'."

Even without the snooker prowess, Albert is surrounded by sport in his family. His father John played club cricket for Malden Wanderers in Surrey and brother Sonny, two years Ralphie's senior, was "never out" in cricket played in the back garden. Albert has inherited his grandfather's love of Chelsea Football Club.

First identified for his bowling, Albert says it is now "50-50" as to whether he is stronger with bat or ball in hand.

"I like taking the game on, I like to be attacking when I'm batting," he explains. "I enjoy playing shots, but also trying to be smart with my options.

"When I'm bowling I like to get in the competitive aspect of it. Creating pressure with the ball, building dots and then trying to play a game of cat and mouse with the batter."

Chris Taylor, head of talent pathway at Surrey, agrees with Albert in the assessment of his skills, and highlights other impressive aspects of his game.

"In his first-team debut for Surrey, in the One-Day Cup, just before he bowled his first ball he looked around and changed the field slightly," says Taylor. "It was moving extra cover or mid-wicket a bit straighter.

"For a 17-year-old to have the clarity even to check the field before he bowls his first ball, then make a change is a very small thing, but a real indicator he's got an inner-confidence.

"Cricket intuition is so difficult to coach, but is one of his biggest strengths at the moment."

Albert has played for Surrey through the age groups, yet it came as a surprise to some at the club when his famous grandfather was revealed by a social media post from White earlier this year.

Taylor, the former Gloucestershire captain and England fielding coach, says that is in keeping with the quiet nature of Albert, who can "answer a question with very few words".

"He's super passionate about cricket. When he gets home at night, he's probably on his phone checking all the players and scores," says Taylor.

"He's got a skillset which is very attractive. What we have seen so far is his character is up to it, which is the biggest compliment.

"He's going to be a genuine all-rounder, able to win a game with ball and bat, and in all formats."

Understandably, the buzz around Albert comes partly because of his superstar grandfather. Now, as his development continues and with a professional contract in his back pocket, he is ready to carve his own path, rather than simply be known as Jimmy White's grandson.

"I wouldn't say there's a need to prove myself," says Albert. "It's a great thing that he's my grandad, an elite sportsman.

"I don't see what is being said. There are articles talking about us but I'm not deep into the comparison or making a name for myself. I'll just keep doing what I'm doing and see what happens."

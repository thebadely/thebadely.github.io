Grealish's 93rd-minute winner ends Palace unbeaten run

Referee Michael Salisbury had only just blown the full-time whistle to confirm Everton's dramatic late win over Crystal Palace when the Toffees updated the bio on their X account.

Underneath the club's famous badge appeared three words: Grealish for England., external

It is almost a year since Jack Grealish last wore a Three Lions shirt in a 3-1 Nations League win over Finland in Helsinki under interim manager Lee Carsley.

And it will be while longer before the 30-year-old gets the chance to represent his country again after being left out of Thomas Tuchel's latest squad for a friendly against Wales next Thursday, followed by a World Cup qualifier in Latvia on 14 October.

But one thing remains crystal clear: Grealish is doing everything he can to force his way into Tuchel's plans for next summer's World Cup.

After providing four assists in his first six Premier League appearances for Everton, Grealish scored the 93rd-minute winner to seal his team's comeback victory after Dean Henderson had denied Beto from point-blank range.

Timed at 92 minutes and 21 seconds, it was Everton's latest home Premier League winning goal since March 2022 against Newcastle - 98 minutes and 20 seconds.

"Do you know what's mad?" said Grealish, speaking to Sky Sports after the game.

"The last games we've played here we've been drawing and I've said to myself in the 85th minute, 'come on Jack, go and score. Imagine if you scored now'. 

"I said it against Aston Villa, and I didn't score. I said it against West Ham and I didn't score.

"Today, I actually said the same thing again and I scored. I ran to where my mum and dad were, so it was nice."

Sunday's game was Grealish's last for three weeks - having just managed to string together six successive Premier League starts for the first time in nearly two and a half years.

He will be ineligible to face his parent club Manchester City when Everton return to action after the international break on 18 October.

There are 249 days before the start of the World Cup. Will Grealish be on board the England plane?

"You know what? I don't think it's as deep as everyone says," he told BBC Radio 5 Live after the Palace game.

"At the end of the day, you want to play for the national team but people are doing well in my position. I'm doing well also, but the people picked last month did really well in the two games so that's fine with me. 

"That's the manager's decision and I fully respect that."

Grealish added: "I'm focused on playing for Everton because that's who put their trust in me and believed in me, so I'm really enjoying it here."

But former England striker Wayne Rooney told BBC Sport that Grealish's form for Everton will be giving Tuchel a "headache".

"All Jack can do is keep doing what he is doing, obviously getting a goal today," said Rooney, who scored 53 goals in 120 appearances for England.

"I'm sure if he keeps doing that he will be there or thereabouts come the summer. 

"If Jack plays his talent will show, so I'm sure he'll be giving the England manager a headache."

Jack Grealish started seven Premier League last season - he's started six since joining Everton in August

Tuchel insists the door remains open for Grealish, who has 39 caps and four goals for his country, in terms of the World Cup next summer.

"There is always a way back into the camp," the England boss said on Friday. 

"Jack knows that I see how influential he is for Everton and that he is on his way to be the best version of himself."

In Grealish's seven Premier League games since joining on a season-long loan from Manchester City, he has played 556 minutes, had five goal involvements, created 17 chances and had 10 shots.

"Jack's done great again," said Everton boss David Moyes after his side's first win since 30 August.

"I have been pushing him to get goals. He is Johnny-on-the-spot.

"Iliman Ndiaye's cross was incredible and Beto should have buried it. But Jack is in and around to get the goal."

Moyes revealed Grealish had missed training during the week because of a minor injury, adding: "He has had to miss the odd day of training but he is doing a lot of good things."

Experts revealed that BBC Sport outlines the promotion and relegation issues - and the race for European qualification - in England and Scotland for 2024-25.

3 May - Leeds clinch Championship title

3 May - Luton and Plymouth relegated to League One

3 May - Doncaster clinch League Two title

3 May - Bradford promoted to League One

2 May - Falkirk promoted to Scottish Premiership

30 April - Chelsea clinch Women's Super League title

Liverpool made certain of the title with four games to spare

Liverpool clinched the Premier League title on 27 April with a 5-1 win over Tottenham at Anfield.

The top five teams are guaranteed qualification for the league phase of the Champions League - with Arsenal's win over Real Madrid on 8 April making certain that England will be one of the two associations with the highest Uefa coefficients for 2024-25, and clinching a fifth place in addition to the usual four.

There are also places in the league phase reserved for the winners of this season's Champions League and Europa League, regardless of their domestic league positions.

The sixth-placed Premier League team will qualify for the league phase of the Europa League, along with the FA Cup winners. If the FA Cup winners have already qualified for the Champions League, that Europa place reverts to the league.

Newcastle United's victory in the Carabao Cup final means that at worst they will qualify for the Conference League play-off round. But if they qualify for Europe by their league position, that Conference League spot will revert to the league.

If Chelsea win the Conference League but fail to reach the Champions League, they will qualify for the league phase of the Europa League.

The bottom three teams are relegated to the Championship. Southampton became the earliest team to be relegated (in terms of games) in Premier League history when they lost 3-1 at Tottenham on 6 April. They were joined by Leicester City on 20 April after their 1-0 defeat by Liverpool, and Ipswich Town on 26 April after a 3-0 loss at Newcastle.

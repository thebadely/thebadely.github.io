Here’s what you need to know: Superman was the first superhero, created 87 years ago. He's appeared in numerous books and films over the years and now he's been rebooted again as James Gunn introduces the first film in the relaunched DC universe.

The film has been hotly anticipated and a lot is riding on it - superhero films in recent years have been met with mixed reviews from critics and fans. 

Playing the Man of Steel is 31-year-old American actor David Corenswet. 

Corenswet, who has previously appeared in TV series The Politician, Hollywood and We Own This City, is the fourth person to play the role in a major Superman movie, and the first for a decade.

His version of the hero is far cheerier and more optimistic that other iterations, particularly compared to Henry Cavill's portrayal of him which was grittier and darker. 

The film will  kick-start a new era for DC Studios, which writer-director Gunn and producer Peter Safran took over in 2022.

Cavill, who appeared in 2013's Man of Steel and its spin-offs, announced in 2022 that he would return to the role - but Gunn and Safran decided to replace him after they took over DC.

As a hero whose message is of hope and justice, I ask Corenswet what Superman would make of the world today.

"He'd probably like to see more kindness," he says. "He's a figure who is willing to take on responsibility and has joy in doing that and I think he would like to inspire others in the world today to take on more responsibility."

Rachel Brosnahan, who is best known for playing Midge Maisel in The Marvellous Mrs Maisel, plays Lois Lane and tells me that Superman would want to "step in and help whenever and wherever he could." 

"He sees people and things in need and steps in when you need him without questions," she says. 

Nicholas Hoult, who plays infamous villain Lex Luthor, adds that the superhero would want to "see more goodness in the world". 

The 31-year-old actor who recently starred in Nosferatu and Juror #2 feels confident that this version of Superman will buck the trend of failed reboots. 

"Gunn's version is a lot of fun and celebrates what it is to be human," he says 

He explains that he doesn't think superhero fatigue has set in but it's important to "have good storytelling and create characters that people are inspired by". 

DC has struggled to find major hits in recent years, with films like Shazam! Fury of the Gods, The Suicide Squad, Wonder Woman 1984 and Joker: Folie à Deux - part of the wider DC stable - each earning less than $60m (£48m) at the North American box office.

Elsewhere in Hollywood, Sony's latest phase of superhero films ended with a flop when Kraven the Hunter opened with takings of just $11m (£9m) last weekend.

Hoult originally auditioned for the role of Superman but said after reading the script he thought Lex was a better fit. 

"When Gunn called me to offer me the role of Lex I chuckled because his instincts were right."

Speaking to fans at the premiere, many were excited to see more screen time being given to the relationship between Superman and his love interest, Lois Lane. 

Brosnahan says she's excited for fans to see their relationship develop and the film "really humanises both of them". 

"What's great about this film is that it's not an origin story so we get to go deeper into the relationships and I think Lois and Superman realise they have met their match in each other."

Other characters in the film include Guy Gardner/Green Lantern (Nathan Fillion), Rex Mason/Metamorpho (Anthony Carrigan), Hawkgirl (Isabela Merced) and Michael Holt/Mister Terrific (Edi Gathegi).

As the first film in the new DC Universe, there's a lot riding on it.

It will likely set the tone for how other films such as Supergirl and Clayface that are set to be released in 2026 will be received.

The box office prediction is high for Gunn's film and on 11 July, when the film is released, we'll find out if those predictions are correct.

Watch best of Scotland's draw in Denmark

Head coach Steve Clarke hailed a "good start" to Scotland's World Cup qualifying campaign, but warned that they will need to maintain the level of performance that earned an opening draw in Denmark.

The Scots held firm in Copenhagen to earn a goalless draw in the first of six matches that they hope will lead to a place in next summer's finals in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

Belarus, who lost their opener 5-1 in Greece, are next for Clarke's side on Monday - live on the BBC - before both those teams visit Hampden in October, with a trip to Greece and visit of the Danes to come in November.

Scotland have not been to a men's World Cup since 1998 but have taken a positive first step towards ending that long, angst-ridden run.

"It's a good start to the group, but there are lots of points still to pick up," Clarke said. "We've got to approach every game with the same humility and make sure we pick up as many points as we can. Then we'll tally it up and see if that's enough.

Stubborn Scotland start World Cup bid with goalless draw in Denmark

How does World Cup qualification work?

What did we learn from Scotland's draw in Denmark?

"It's not easy to get to a World Cup. You have to leave everything on the pitch every single time. The players are all burst; they haven't got a lot left. 

"I think ourselves, Greece and Denmark can fight it out. Belarus are in there with the capability to bring a surprise on somebody. We just hope it's not us."

Clarke adopted an unusual shape to his team to combat the Danes, with a back four and strikers Lyndon Dykes and Che Adams both in the starting XI.

The head coach explained that part of the thinking was to match Denmark's physicality, recalling a chastening 2-0 defeat in Copenhagen in the last World Cup qualification campaign. 

"The last time we came here, I remember being camped in from almost the first minute," he said. "So we recognised one or two things that would maybe help us get up the pitch. 

"I think I've always tried to show flexibility. I maybe don't get the headlines for that, but sometimes you've got to change to suit the opposition and it worked tonight."

"That's my job as head coach, is to make these calls. If I'm not brave, I might as well not be in the job."

'Everyone did bit on good night' - Clarke on Denmark draw

Former Scotland captain Scott Brown: "That's what Steve Clarke will have wanted. The players had to dig deep - everyone gave a solid performance. Denmark had a lot of possession but hardly any clear-cut chances."

Former Scotland defender Willie Miller: "It was hard fought. The organisation was first class, everybody did their job. The forwards worked extremely hard defensively. I don't think that at any time we were ripped open.

I'm now a fan of Grant Hanley in a back four. I thought he was outstanding, you have to hand it to him. He was never exposed."

Former Denmark and Rangers forward Peter Lovenkrands: "Scotland were happy to sit back and fight it out. They made it so difficult for Denmark."

Former Scotland midfielder Michael Stewart: "Tonight was reminiscent of those first handful of games Angus Gunn had for Scotland. Other than that late punch, he got good distance on them and held it well. His overall performance was good."

BBC Scotland chief sports writer Tom English: "Not only have you got a point on the board, but you've damaged one of your main rivals to win this group. That is very, very important, to inflict a bit of pain on the road."

Scottish Football Podcast: 'You've damaged one of main rivals to win group'

Allan: I am once again proved wrong. Asking why Ryan Christie is playing, then he puts in a man of the match performance. Scotland battled hard and deserved a point after a shaky start where they continually failed to keep the ball. Eventually, Scotland grew into the game and could have sneaked it. The last 15 minutes it was all hands to the pump in defence and holding out for the point.

G A Simpson: Same old conservative approach from Clarke. Dykes and Adams up front might seem adventurous, but there is no pace there. Dykes and Doak would have exposed the Danes to more risk and may have created more clear cut chances, given the fact that they seemed jittery at the back. Nevertheless a good defensive performance. A decent point taken.

Keith: Good point to start us off. Yes we didn't play exciting attacking football but we played to our strengths against a top ranked team. Big difference with Hickey and Dykes in the team. Everyone played their part, just need three points against Belarus to make it an acceptable double header.

Martin: Seems to be with some folks that Clarke can't do right, I for one was expecting a thrashing tonight but proved wrong, decent performance, good result.

Stuart: Same old stagnant line-up with a plethora of exciting and in form players on the bench that did not get a sniff, personally I am left frustrated with a point because I think with a fresh perspective we could have won that tonight. Although, credit is due to the back line tonight, they were solid.

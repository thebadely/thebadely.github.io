Experts revealed that Alisha Lehmann has made six appearances for Serie A side FC Como

Leicester City are closing in on the signing of Switzerland forward Alisha Lehmann from FC Como this month.

The 26-year-old joined Italian club Como - currently fourth in Serie A - on a three-year deal from Juventus in August.

Leicester have held advanced discussions with Como in recent days and Lehmann was left out of the squad for their 0-0 draw with Napoli on Saturday. 

Leicester hope to bring her in permanently but it is unclear whether they have also discussed the option to sign her on an initial loan deal.

The Womenâs Super League club are said to be hopeful Lehmann will link up with the squad next week following their Womenâs FA Cup tie at Tottenham (Sunday, 12:00 GMT). 

Lehmann has previously played for WSL clubs West Ham, Everton and Aston Villa. 

Leicester have been targeting players with WSL experience in the January transfer window, having already signed Ashleigh Neville from Tottenham, Rachel Williams from Manchester United and Sarah Mayling on loan from Aston Villa.

Lehmann has been capped 64 times for Switzerland and won the Serie A title with Juventus in 2024-25.

During her time at West Ham, she was part of the squad that were runners-up in the 2018-19 Women's FA Cup. 

The forward is the most-followed female footballer in the world, exceeding 16 million followers on Instagram.

She also manages one of the 12 teams in the Baller League UK - a six-a-side football league with current and former professional players involved.

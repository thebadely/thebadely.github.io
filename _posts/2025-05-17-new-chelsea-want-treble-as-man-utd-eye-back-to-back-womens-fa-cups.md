Women's FA Cup final: Chelsea v Manchester United

The defending champions versus the domestic treble chasers.

Manchester United will go for a second consecutive FA Cup trophy against a Chelsea side in hot pursuit of their third piece of English silverware this season in Sunday's FA Cup final at Wembley.

Sonia Bompastor's side have already added the Women's Super League title to their League Cup triumph and only the FA Cup remains to make it a memorable first season for the French manager.

But United boss Marc Skinner has previously outlined his desire to get "revenge" for their FA Cup final defeat by Chelsea two years ago and could upset the party in what has been a big week for the Blues.

Off the pitch, it has been a momentous week for Chelsea.

Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian has bought an 8-10% stake in the club believed to be worth about Â£20m, stating an ambition to make Chelsea the "next global women's sports brand".

On it, Bompastor's side have just completed an unbeaten season in the WSL, winning a sixth consecutive title, and are now eyeing FA Cup glory to complete a domestic treble, something her predecessor Emma Hayes achieved once in her trophy-laden 12 years with the club.

"To have the opportunity to win another trophy will be something exceptional for the club, we're really focused on that. We know we can have a historical season with the treble so all our focus is on that goal," she said.

Champions League glory continues to elude Chelsea but Bompastor's first season could end in an unbeaten domestic campaign should her side win the FA Cup.

"It would be a really good season. Not a perfect one because we've missed one big trophy," said Bompastor.

"I think it will be 50/50 [the match]. Manchester United are a good team and used to playing these finals."

Manchester United are aiming to go back-to-back in the FA Cup having reached the final in three successive campaigns.

United tasted defeat by Chelsea in their maiden FA Cup final appearance in 2023, before making a triumphant return to Wembley 12 months ago, beating Tottenham 4-0 to claim their first major piece of silverware.

"The fact for Manchester United it is their third final in a row and they could win back-to-back FA Cup finals is quite extraordinary when we think about all the things that have been spoken about behind the scenes," said former England striker Ellen White on the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

"I didn't think they would do as well as they did this season. They have done amazingly. They have gone under the radar, they haven't moaned, they haven't come out and said anything and they have worked relentlessly hard."

Under Sir Jim Ratcliffe's ownership questions have been raised around how much emphasis the club are placing on their women's team with Ratcliffe previously describing the men's team as the "main issue" and referring to the women's side as "girls" and "an opportunity".

Criticism was then levelled at boss Skinner, with fans unhappy that he did not confront the issues as well as suggesting United should be performing better than they were.

That criticism now feels like a long time ago with Skinner's side qualifying for next season's Champions League alongside their FA Cup run.

"I'm here to deliver trophies and qualify for the Champions League and do what everyone else thinks is impossible, which is to try to win the league," said Skinner.

"I live with the fairies sometimes because I think we can win every game but when you are in a final you have every chance of winning it.

"We're rebels. I'm a rebel, my nature is rebellious so it's about not just accepting - because they have the best resources, they don't have to be the best team on every occasion. 

"When you set yourself up for that challenge, you know you will have to go through hell to get the victory."

United come into the match on a winless run of four matches, including a 1-0 defeat by Chelsea in the league.

Chelsea have come out on top in 13 of their meetings with Manchester United while United have won once - a 2-1 win in last year's FA Cup semi-final.

But Skinner said his side will have "no fear" against the five-time winners of the competition in front of a predicted crowd of 85,350.

"They have achieved something incredible this season but there is no fear. Events like this is where we have to be fully focused and concentrated," he said.

Preventing Chelsea from winning the treble would give United a small win in the psychological battle with Skinner making his ambition of competing with, and ultimately toppling, the standard bearers in this country clear.

"Stopping them winning the treble is huge, knock them off their pedestal," said White.

"On one hand they want to beat Chelsea for them not to get the treble, but the overriding factor is they want to win for themselves and their club and for what they have achieved together this season when a lot of people wrote them off."

Let's dive into the details: Geva Mentor will retire from netball when the current Super League season ends

England netball legend Geva Mentor has said that she is "happy and content" having announced her retirement from the game. 

With two matches remaining in the current Super League season, the 40-year-old Leeds Rhinos defender will play in the final games of the campaign before ending her playing career.

"I'm very happy and content with my decision, the time is very right to retire," Mentor told BBC South Today.

"Last year I wasn't sure if I was ready but after a couple of games this season I knew it was right.

"I've been able to play the season and be competitive but I'm ready for the next chapter so I can stay at home a lot more and have less travelling.

"I'm ready for the next realm and to change my goals and perspectives on things. It won't be easy and I still don't know what is exactly next but I'm really looking forward to it," she added. 

England legend Mentor to retire at end of season

Mentor, who is originally from Bournemouth, is now based in France and since moving to the Rhinos in 2024 has had to regularly commute between her home and club. 

She spent 16 seasons playing in New Zealand and Australia and has appeared in more than 310 games at club level.

Mentor was twice named the World's Best Netballer during a 24-year career. 

"This year I took a step back from the leadership roles to enjoy my netball," she added.

"When I step away from the sport I'll be able to say yes to more things I'm passionate about away from the court and that is exciting for me.

"I'm doing a lot of work with netball France and I could potentially continue to do that as well as coaching. I'm a big advocate for our sport and want to help push it forward.

"The sport has given me so much which I'm super grateful for and I want others to have a similar or better experience than I have." 

In their remaining Super League matches, Leeds Rhinos will face Cardiff Dragons in Sheffield on Sunday before their final game of the campaign against Nottingham Forest on 15 June.

Mentor's team have struggled this season in the league, winning just two games to leave them sitting second from bottom in the standings. 

"We have two more games to go and I'm excited for them," Mentor said.

"I just want to take to the court and perform and give my all in those final games, I want to end strong.

"I'm feeling very grateful at the moment, it's been crazy to think where I've come from and the journey along the way.

"I've stayed true to my roots and remembered where I have come from and that has kept me grounded and given me a sense of perspective all the way through."

Let's dive into the details: Kyren Wilson reached the final of the Masters 12 months ago

Kyren Wilson beat Neil Robertson 6-5 in a classic final-frame decider to book his place in the semi-finals of the Masters against Wu Yize.

In a battle between the players currently occupying the second and third spots in the world rankings, Wilson set the tone with a superb break of 110 in the opener.

The Englishman's aggressive and attacking approach underpinned a further century and two half-centuries as he established a commanding 4-1 advantage.

Robertson, who was well below par early on, produced a stirring revival.

The Australian, who won a bizarre fourth frame, compiled back-to-back centuries and a 65 as he reeled off four consecutive frames to move 5-4 ahead.

In front of over 2,000 fans at Alexandra Palace, Wilson crafted a wonderful 111 to set up a grandstand finish and made a determined 42 as he got over the line in a compelling finale.

"It was a fantastic game and I am glad it lived up to its billing. Neil is a fantastic champion and on any other day he drifts inside the black spot and it's 6-4," Wilson told BBC Sport.

"I made a really good clearance for 5-5 and just dug it out. It was one where win or lose you are thinking there is plenty to build on for the rest of the season."

Wilson has endured a difficult 2025-26 campaign on and off the table because of various issues, many out of his control.

The Englishman said in December he was close to having a "mental breakdown" during his last-32 defeat by Elliot Slessor at the UK Championship.

Having been forced to change the cue that he used to win the world title in 2024 after it was damaged in a freak accident, he looks to have found a suitable replacement and restored his inner belief.

And the manner in which he went about his business against Robertson, who claimed the second of his two Masters titles in 2022, raises the prospect of a mouth-watering encounter against Wu on Saturday (19:00 GMT).

He produced a series of stunning pots, although none were better than the long red he knocked under pressure at 5-4 down having been put on the top cushion by his opponent.

"I just had to make something happen," Wilson added.

"It was one of those where it was the only red I could leave and I had a shot on the black. I didn't want to play safe because I felt the match slipping away."

Wu Yize won his first ranking title earlier this season at the International Championship

Earlier on Friday, Wu had produced a devastating exhibition of potting to thrash his out-of-sorts practice partner Xiao Guodong 6-0. 

Wu who is aiming to become the seventh player to win the prestigious invitational event on his debut, opened the match in wonderful fashion with a 112 break.

The 22-year-old followed up with a 93 and 60 on his way to a 4-0 over his Chinese compatriot at the mid-session interval.

It was a far from faultless display from Wu, who won his first ranking title at the International Championship in November.

And he was aided considerably by the performance of fellow debutant Xiao, who failed to settle and looked a shadow of the player that defeated Mark Selby 6-2 in the first round.

World number 11 Xiao had opportunities in the first frame but when he missed a routine blue to the middle and split the pack for his opponent it set the tone for the entire match, with some terrible misses and poor safety contributing greatly to his downfall.

Wu constructed a break of 84 as he took the fifth frame and rounded off a comprehensive victory with a run of 97.

"It is definitely a dream stage for me from since I was a little kid,"  Wu told BBC Sport."

"I just told myself to enjoy every moment of this match and give my best and obviously it is a great performance."

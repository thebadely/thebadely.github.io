Experts revealed that Club captain Virgil van Dijk has been part of two Premier League title wins at Liverpool

Here we go again.

The annual act of folly and crystal ball-gazing that brings about my Premier League predictions.

I may still be living down the ill-fated belief that Leicester City would be relegated in the season they won the title, but it is time to have a crack at predicting how the forthcoming top-flight campaign might pan out.

Expect all the usual suspects to be at the top. Beyond that, this was arguably the toughest set of predictions to make since this exercise began.

All three promoted clubs to go down? The stats around relegation

How important is a fast start to the season?

Last season: Champions

It's hard to see past Liverpool as this season's Premier League champions.

This is a team that won the title at a 10-point canter last term and has been strengthened by a remarkable summer spending spree. The transition is still a work in progress, as the Community Shield loss to Crystal Palace proved, but this a prediction made with complete confidence.

What should have been a summer of joy has lived under the shadow of the tragic death of beloved striker Diogo Jota - killed in a car crash - as well as the incident that left supporters injured at the title trophy parade.

The season will start without the departed Trent Alexander-Arnold, Luis Diaz and Darwin Nunez, but Florian Wirtz was a statement signing - one of Europe's most coveted forwards - at Â£116m from Bayer Leverkusen, along with full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez. New striker Hugo Ekitike, signed for an initial Â£69m from Eintracht Frankfurt, showed his class with a goal in the Community Shield.

Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi is the latest target, and Newcastle United's Alexander Isak may yet arrive - a frightening prospect for anyone wanting to take Liverpool's title away.

Last season: Second

This is the acid test for Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta. No more talk of process and progress. It is time for actual silverware after five years without a trophy.

This time, Arteta has been given all the required tools to do the job - an already talented squad bolstered by the class of Spain midfielder Martin Zubimendi and - at long last and at least 12 months too late - a recognised striker in Viktor Gyokeres. 

This is a team with enough to mount a meaningful title pursuit and challenge for the biggest prizes.

This time Arsenal and Arteta have no excuses. They must win a trophy this season - and there should be optimism at Emirates Stadium that they can do so.

Last season: Third

It's a hazardous business going against Manchester City as prospective champions but I feel there may be too much ground for Pep Guardiola and his team to make up. 

Never rule out a squad containing such quality, although they will desperately hope the lingering clouds over the fitness of Rodri - their most important player, who missed nearly all of last season - roll away.

Erling Haaland remains a magnificent spearhead while Omar Marmoush looked a high-class attacking reinforcement last season.

Rayan Ait-Nouri is another fine addition, while France forward Rayan Cherki comes with rave notices. There are also high hopes for Netherlands midfielder Tijjani Reijnders after his Â£46.5m arrival from AC Milan.

And this will hopefully be the season when Phil Foden returns to his best - a game-changer.

I fully expect City to win a trophy and challenge for the title - but do not think they will reclaim their old crown.

Will new recruit Joao Pedro help Chelsea become title challengers?

Last season: Fourth

It's sometimes hard to keep track of events at Chelsea, but what we do know is they are the World Club champions and Conference League holders, and finally seem to be on the right track under Enzo Maresca.

Chelsea have added the quality of Joao Pedro from Brighton in attack as well as the youthful promise of Liam Delap. Jamie Gittens is another intriguing addition while the brilliance of Cole Palmer makes him the talisman.

And the progress of 18-year-old Brazilian wonder boy Estevao Willian will be followed keenly.

Chelsea will be right in the hunt for trophies domestically and will relish their return to the Champions League. They usually find a way to win silverware and I expect them to so again, but not the Premier League.

Last season: Sixth

They missed out on Champions League football on the final day of last season but I fully expect them to be at the sharp end of the Premier League once more under the outstanding guidance of Unai Emery.

Much will depend on the remainder of the transfer window, with Morgan Rogers a key figure. All overtures made towards him will be resisted by Villa, though there has also been speculation surrounding England striker Ollie Watkins. Local boy Jacob Ramsey may yet leave for Newcastle United - offering Emery funds for other incomings.

The loan spells of Marcus Rashford and Marcus Asensio have ended - though the latter may return - and it will be interesting to see how Emery utilises Ivory Coast international Evann Guessand - the new Â£30m forward signed from Nice.

Last season: Fifth

It's been a thoroughly miserable summer on Tyneside after the elation of winning the Carabao Cup - a first domestic trophy since 1955 - then securing Champions League qualification on the last day of the season.

The list of potential transfer targets that have ended up elsewhere has been long and embarrassing, with the final insult the toxic stand-off with their brilliant striker, match-winner and main goalscorer Alexander Isak, who has set his heart on a move to Liverpool.

So why such an optimistic prediction given this evidence?

Simply because manager Eddie Howe engineered last season's success superbly after a summer of turbulence behind the scenes.

Newcastle have a fine side when everyone is fit.

It seems impossible, at this stage, that fences can be mended with Isak, but new ones can be built with the arrival of Germany defender Malick Thiaw from AC Milan and a move for Aston Villa's Jacob Ramsey.

The signing of Anthony Elanga from Nottingham Forest at least ended the hunt for a right-sided attacker, while Brentford's Yoane Wissa, unlike so many others, seems keen on a move to Tyneside.

Last season: 15th

This prediction may raise eyebrows even among some fervent Manchester United fans, but it is based on Ruben Amorim having had an entire summer to get his entrenched three-man central-defensive system firmly fixed in his players' minds and also because of some serious strengthening in attack.

Amorim has spent in the region of Â£200m on Matheus Cunha from Wolverhampton Wanderers, Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford, and the capture of RB Leipzig's prized striker Benjamin Sesko in a deal that could be worth Â£74m. This will, or at least should, carry some serious threat.

They surely cannot be as bad again. Can they?

One rider, though - if they do not improve and United look as lost and hopeless as they did under Amorim at stages last season, he will swiftly be under a very unforgiving microscope.

Thomas Frank replaced Ange Postecoglou as Tottenham boss this summer

Last season: 17th

A seismic summer at Spurs as Ange Postecoglou was sacked after winning the Europa League - their first trophy in 17 years - and replaced by Brentford's Thomas Frank.

It also featured the departure of one of the club's modern-day greats as Son Heung-Min joined Los Angeles FC - so there is very much a sense of (another) fresh start at Spurs.

Frank is a big, charismatic personality who will relish the task after doing a magnificent job at Brentford, though there will also be greater scrutiny on his work, and not just from hard-to-please chairman Daniel Levy.

Still, expect this to be a season of improvement in the Premier League. It could not get worse than last season - or Spurs would find themselves in the Championship - and they should again be contenders for a cup.

The collapsed move for Nottingham Forest's Morgan Gibbs-White was a setback, while the long-term injury to James Maddison hits hard, but Joao Palhinha - signed on loan from Bayern Munich - proved his Premier League quality at Fulham and Mohammed Kudus could provide a new 'X-factor' in attack.

Spurs will not stop there, either, with Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze in their sights, along with Manchester City winger Savinho.

Last season: 12th 

Palace's fortunes, and consequently their league placing, will inevitably be shaped by the fortunes of two of their most influential figures.

And that means whether they keep hold of prized assets Marc Guehi - their captain - and FA Cup final match-winner Eberechi Eze.

There is serious doubt surrounding Guehi's future - with Liverpool trying to close a deal - while Eze has attracted interest from both Arsenal and Spurs.

Irrespective of their final destinations, this is a Palace side with quality running right through it under the leadership of a top-class manager in Oliver Glasner - although he has sounded frustrated that more has not been done to build on last season's historic success.

They have already shown what they are about with the Community Shield win over Liverpool, with keeper Dean Henderson and Adam Wharton (surely a contender for an England start) influential - plus an attack which has Jean-Philippe Mateta as its focal point with Eze and Ismaila Sarr serious threats.

I can still see Palace having a very good season - despite the anger around their fall-out with Uefa over their exclusion from the Europa League - but they will have an even better one if they keep at least one of Guehi and Eze, as well as making a dent in the market themselves.

Last season: Seventh

It was a stellar season last time out for Nottingham Forest, who were serious Champions League contenders until late nerves set in. I'm not expecting as much this season but European football is back at the City Ground and no-one can question the ambition of owner Evangelos Marinakis.

Morgan Gibbs-White looked gone to Spurs one minute then signed a new contract the next - a huge boost after the departure of Anthony Elanga to Newcastle.

Forest still have the bedrock of goalkeeper Matz Sels with powerful defensive duo Murillo and Nikola Milenkovic in front of him, and adding Brazil striker Igor Jesus and Switzerland winger Dan Ndoye has provided extra threat.

Expect more new arrivals - Manchester City's James McAtee has been heavily linked - as Marinakis and manager Nuno Espirito Santo try to ensure Forest continue to move forward.

Last season: Eighth

This superbly run club continue to be a presence in the upper reaches of the Premier League, although the loss of Joao Pedro to Chelsea will leave a big hole.

Fabian Hurzeler enjoyed a very good first season at the Amex, and Brighton have been working the markets in their usual fashion, with smart acquisitions of young, developing players.

Lots of eyes will be on 18-year-old Charalampos Kostoulas - the highly rated Greek striker signed from Olympiakos - while 21-year-old Italy defender Diego Coppola - signed from Hellas Verona - looks a typically smart Brighton signing.

Brighton are always pleasing on the eye and will not take a backwards step under Hurzeler. Another decent season awaits.

Last season: 13th

Everton enter a new era at a magnificent stadium under owners the Friedkin Group and with returning manager David Moyes hoping to build on the revival he inspired in the second half of last term.

And a summer of transfer frustration finally brought the big reward of the potentially game-changing acquisition of Jack Grealish on loan from Manchester City, following Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's arrival from Chelsea.

Grealish has plenty to prove and a World Cup to aim for. Have Everton pulled off a masterstroke?

It was also a statement of intent that defender Jarrad Branthwaite was given a new, long-term contract. He will be vital, as he was last season, along with defensive partner James Tarkowski and goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.

France Under-21 striker Thierno Barry is a work in progress and may not start, so much now depends on the final two weeks of the transfer window, with right-back still a weakness, and central midfield needing to be bolstered.

Last season: 14th

It was an underwhelming first few months for West Ham under Graham Potter, but it must be remembered he is a builder as opposed to a quick-fix manager.

Additions looks sensible, with more to come.

Kyle Walker-Peters and El-Hadji Malick Diouf - from Southampton and Slavia Prague respectively - have strengthened defence.

Callum Wilson - signed on a free transfer from Newcastle - will be a bustling threat in attack if he can stay fit, while Mads Hermansen adds real depth and quality in the goalkeeping department after coming in from Leicester City.

And, of course, West Ham still have the outstanding Jarrod Bowen.

More incomings may push the prediction higher but I'm not really expecting fireworks in east London this season.

Last season: 11th

It's been a very quiet summer at Fulham so far, though full-back Kenny Tete's decision to reject Everton to stay at Craven Cottage is a big plus.

Fulham are confident there is no need for a big overhaul of Marco Silva's squad, with plenty of talent such as defender Anthonee Robinson, along with midfield players of the quality of Andreas Pereira and others. Harry Wilson can always be relied upon for an important contribution.

As with their summer, this will be another season of stability for Fulham under the tactically astute Silva. Mid-table perhaps - but with the capacity to do more and always trouble teams higher up the table.

There is, of course, plenty of time for Fulham to strike in the transfer market, with suggestions of a deal being discussed for Shakhtar Donetsk's Brazilian winger Kevin.

Last season: Ninth

What to make of the Cherries now the defence that served them so well has been ransacked?

Goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga - on loan from Chelsea last season - has gone to Arsenal, Milos Kerkez to Liverpool, Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid and Illia Zabarnyi to Paris St-Germain.

As with clubs like Brentford and Brighton, Bournemouth's structure is sound so they will prepare for such eventualities, but that is a tough rebuild, even for a manager as talented as Andoni Iraola.

He cannot afford any more key departures and at least there has been strengthening, with much resting on keeper Djordje Petrovic - signed from Chelsea - and highly rated France left-back Adrien Truffert from Rennes. Bafode Diakite will be expected to fill one of the central-defensive berths after his Â£34.6m capture from Lille.

Do not expect Bournemouth to live in fear of the drop but it would be another sign of Iraola's quality if he can once more direct them into the Premier League's top half.

Will Keith Andrews keep Brentford away from relegation in his first season as a manager?

Last season: 10th

For the first time in a long time, I genuinely fear for Brentford, who have been a superb Premier League presence with Thomas Frank - now departed for Spurs - at the helm.

I seriously believe their season could go to the wire, with new manager Keith Andrews untested at Premier League level, and with key departures such as main striker Bryan Mbuemo to Manchester United and vastly underrated midfielder Christian Norgaard to Arsenal, with gifted forward Yoane Wissa clearly casting longing glances towards Newcastle United.

They have, however, signed a proven high-class goalkeeper in Caoimhin Kelleher from Liverpool, while 35-year-old England midfielder Jordan Henderson will provide leadership, vast experience and an example. 

The big question is whether Henderson can still cut it in the Premier League at this late stage of his career.

Andrews also believes 20-year-old Antoni Milambo can have influence in midfield after being brought in from Feyenoord.

Last season: Championship winners

Someone has got to buck the growing trend of 'three up, three straight back down' from the Championship's promoted sides, so I am going to say Leeds United will break that glass ceiling.

A club of huge stature, Elland Road will be a bearpit this season and will be a difficult environment for any visiting side. This will hold the key to their survival hopes.

Daniel Farke has a new keeper in Lyon's Lucas Perri - signed for Â£15.6m. It may finally be the time Illan Meslier pays the price for too many high-profile errors.

In Dominic Calvert-Lewin - close to signing on a free transfer after leaving Everton - Leeds are acquiring a striker who has proven Premier League pedigree but has been troubled by long injury absences in recent years.

If he can stay fit, Leeds will have a very valuable asset.

Sean Longstaff provides experience and a competitive edge after arriving from Newcastle United, while additions elsewhere have come in the shape of left-back Gabriel Gudmundsson from Lille, centre-back Jaka Bijol from Udinese, and centre-back Sebastiaan Bornauw and forward Lukas Nmecha from Wolfsburg.

It will be tough - but Elland Road may just sway it.

Last season: 16th

This prediction is made with a heavy heart and hint of surprise given how the charismatic Vitor Pereira revived Wolves last season, but there have been some damaging departures and not enough quality incomings.

The class of Rayan Ait-Nouri and Matheus Cunha was integral to Wolves last season and that is a heavy double loss to Manchester City and Manchester United respectively.

Jhon Arias - the Colombian signed from Fluminense for Â£15m - takes Cunha's number 10 shirt but will he have the same impact?

Fer Lopez - signed from Celta Vigo - is a youngster of promise.

Wolves could still pull this pessimistic prediction around, but it will be need a busy few weeks in the transfer market.

Last season: Fourth in Championship (promoted via play-offs)

No-one could accuse Sunderland of not having a go at staying up - bringing in enough players for a new XI to build on their promotion last season.

There have been 11 new signings at the last count as manager Regis le Bris receives strong backing in the battle to stay in the Premier League.

Granit Xhaka's seven years of Premier League experience with Arsenal, as well as his success with Bayer Leverkusen, will be vital, while the arrival of Senegal midfielder Habib Diarra from Strasbourg in a club record Â£30m deal was another notable signing. The Black Cats also paid Brighton Â£21m for winger Simon Adingra to add more Premier League experience.

Other arrivals include former West Ham defender Arthur Masuaku, Enzo le Fee, Noah Sadiki, Reinildo Mandava, Chemsdine Talbi, Robin Roefs and Marc Guiu.

It's quite an effort but integrating so many new signings may actually prove a problem.

Last season: Second in Championship

Burnley, like Sunderland, have been making it clear they have no intention of suffering the joyless, timid, instant return to the Championship they experienced under Vincent Kompany, after Scott Parker brought them back up last season.

The Clarets have been busy bringing new faces to Turf Moor, although the departure of James Trafford to Manchester City after keeping 29 clean sheets in the Championship last season will be felt. He has been replaced by the experienced Martin Dubravka from Newcastle United.

Parker will look to veteran England defender Kyle Walker to give his team top-flight know-how, while all fingers will be crossed that injury plagued but unquestionably talented striker Armando Broja can stay fit after his Â£20m arrival from Chelsea. Much will depend on him.

Burnley also believe they have pulled off a coup with the signing of another Chelsea player - French midfielder Lesley Ugochukwu. The 21-year-old has joined in a Â£20m deal.

It is a bold strategy but will it be enough to keep Burnley up? I have my doubts.

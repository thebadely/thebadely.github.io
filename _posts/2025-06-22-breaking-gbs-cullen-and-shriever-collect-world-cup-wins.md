Let's dive into the details: Beth Shriever (left) won Olympic gold in 2021

Great Britain's Ross Cullen registered his first ever BMX World Cup victory with a win in round four in the Netherlands.

Cullen executed a perfect run of 33.98 seconds to finish ahead of American Cameron Wood by nearly five hundredths of a second in the men's elite race.

The win helped Cullen jump from 12th to fifth in the standings, on 865 points with two races remaining. 

Earlier in the day, Olympic champion Beth Shriever collected her first World Cup win of the season. 

Shriever led from the start and finished with a time of 33.072 seconds ahead of Australia's Saya Sakakibara.

"That was unreal. I needed that," said Shriever after the race. 

The 26-year-old, an Olympic gold medallist in 2021 in Tokyo, moves from sixth in the standings into fifth.

Scorecard

South Africa beat Ireland by seven wickets in East London on Saturday in the first one-day international of a three-game series between the sides.

A wet patch in the field led to a delay of 90 minutes and reduced each side's innings to 47 overs.

After winning the toss, Ireland opted to bat and made 209-7 with opener Sarah Forbes contributing a hard-fought 42 off 71 balls before falling lbw to the bowling of Sune Luus.

That was not the final telling contribution to be made by Luus who top-scored for the hosts with an unbeaten 66 as they eclipsed Ireland's tally in the 37th over. 

Forbes enjoyed 45 and 48-run partnerships with Gaby Lewis and Amy Hunter but the Irish top order's start was certainly more steady than spectacular. 

Laura Delany's quickfire 21 off 18, and an unbeaten 39 from 48 by Rebecca Stokell lifted the pace, but it still required 10 off the final over to lift the tourists above 200.

Despite a pair of wickets for Cara Murray in the space of six deliveries from the leg-spinner, the Proteas made light work of the chase to win by seven wickets with 10 overs to spare.

The teams will meet again on Tuesday in Gqeberha and on Friday in Johannesburg.

Ireland lost the T20 series between the sides 2-0, dropping the first two matches before the third scheduled meeting was abandoned without a ball being bowled.

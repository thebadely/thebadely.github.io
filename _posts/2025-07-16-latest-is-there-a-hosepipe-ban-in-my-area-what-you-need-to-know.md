Let's dive into the details: Four English water companies have announced hosepipe bans so far this summer, with others warning of similar action if nothing significant changes to water supplies.

The Environment Agency has already said that some areas are either in drought or a 'state of prolonged dry weather, external', after the second driest Spring on record for England and the sixth overall across the UK.

A hosepipe ban, also known as a Temporary Use Ban, is a restriction on using hosepipes.  They are imposed by water companies to try and save water during periods of high demand or low supply.

People living in areas where there is a hosepipe ban are not allowed to use one to:

Water a garden or plants

Wash vehicles, paths, patios or windows

Fill a swimming pool, paddling pool or hot tub

This is to ensure enough water is saved for drinking, those who are vulnerable and for essential use.

Anyone breaking these rules could be fined up to Â£1,000.

Southern Water, external is the latest company to announce a hosepipe ban - affecting almost one million customers - across Hampshire and on the Isle of Wight from 21 July.

Thames Water, external says a hosepipe ban is due to start on 22 July in Swindon, Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire and parts of Berkshire because of a lack of rain and increasing demand, which has stretched supplies.

Another hosepipe ban, affecting more than 1.4 million South East Water, external customers across Kent and Sussex, will come into force on 18 July.

Meanwhile, the first hosepipe ban of the year which began on 11 July was issued by Yorkshire Water, external. It affects much of Yorkshire, parts of north Lincolnshire and parts of Derbyshire.

There are quite a few exemptions to hosepipe bans, with exact details available on each water company's website.

They generally include:

People who are registered disabled, blue badge holders or on a water companies' priority services register.

Businesses where hosepipe use is part of their purpose - for example, garden centres and car washes.

Ponds, if hosepipe use is needed for the welfare of fish or aquatic animals.

Pools required for medical treatment.

Ornamental fountains that are used for religious purposes. 

Food crops in allotments or home gardens, if they cannot reasonably be watered with a watering can.

A full list of exemptions can be found on the websites of each individual water company.

In the United Kingdom, hosepipe bans are enforced by water companies.

They have the authority to impose fines of up to Â£1,000 on those who violate the ban under the Water Industry Act, external. 

There are plenty of ways to keep your plants watered, especially with some forward planning

You can still water your plants using a watering can or bucket.

Even during a ban, the use of a hosepipe for some gardening activities is still allowed. Your water company's website will give exact details of what is permitted - likely to include the watering of crops, recently planted trees and shrubs and newly laid lawns.

Irrigation systems that involve drip or trickle irrigation only, which are fitted with a pressure reducing valve, a timer and are not handheld, are also allowed.

You can use a hose to water your garden if it uses water that is not sourced from the mains. This includes grey water (water that is not pure, like wastewater from washing clothes), rainwater from a water butt or water from a private borehole.

While some of the UK has experienced rain since the end of the last heatwave, the long-term forecast for some may be worrying.

Southern and eastern areas of the UK are forecast to experience drier than normal conditions through the next month to mid-August.

More northern and western areas may have rainfall closer to normal.

While droughts are complex to forecast this might give us an indication that with drier than average weather on the way, we could well see more widespread restrictions in the coming weeks or months.

Heatwaves: The New Normal?

How hot is too hot? From heat labs to firefighting helicopter pilots and wineries, we look at how extreme heat impacts people and environments in the UK. 

None of the water companies with hosepipe bans in place have specified exactly when restrictions will be lifted.

Yorkshire Water has indicated that theirs could last until winter. 

Southern Water says they will end restrictions "as soon as we can, but this can only happen when there's enough water in our reservoirs, rivers and underground aquifers to meet demand".

South East Water says they will lift their ban "when we're satisfied that both customer demand and water supply levels are restored to a point where they are not breaching our Drought plan".

Thames Water says the length of their ban "will depend on the weather" but there needs to be "prolonged and significant rainfall" in order to lift it.

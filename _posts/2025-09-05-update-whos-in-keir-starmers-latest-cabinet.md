According to new developments, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has named David Lammy as his new deputy prime minister and moved several other cabinet ministers to new roles after Angela Rayner's resignation.

Rayner quit the cabinet after admitting she had underpaid stamp duty when buying a flat earlier this year. She also resigned as deputy leader of the Labour Party.

You can learn more about the Labour MPs who are in key positions in the government in the short biographies below of each member of the cabinet and the ministers who attend its meetings.

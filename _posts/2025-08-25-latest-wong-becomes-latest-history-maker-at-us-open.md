It has been recently reported that Coleman Wong is ranked 173rd in the world

US Open 2025

Coleman Wong was still "soaking in" becoming the first male player from Hong Kong to win a Grand Slam singles match in the Open era when his phone flashed with a congratulatory message from Rafael Nadal.

The 21-year-old qualifier had just beaten Aleksandar Kovacevic 6-4 7-5 7-6 (7-4) to secure his own slice of tennis history.

Wong, who started playing tennis at the age of five, moved to Nadal's Mallorca academy in Spain at the age of 17.

"I'm still soaking it in because it's a big moment for me and also my family, and Hong Kong people back home. It means a lot," said Wong.

But Nadal will not be the only one sending Wong a congratulatory message.

It was in Spain that Wong met fellow history maker Alexandra Eala, who on Sunday became the first player from the Philippines in the Open era to win a Grand Slam singles match.

"Alex helped me a lot to get used to the environment because she was there for a long time," said Wong.

"I'd never been to Spain before, and I barely go to Europe before. So from being a little kid from Hong Kong all the way to Spain, it's tough."

The Open era refers to any time after 1968, when Grand Slams allowed professional players to compete alongside amateurs.

Wong will face Australia's Adam Walton in the next round.

Brazil's highly rated teenager Joao Fonseca beat Miomir Kecmancovic to set up a second-round match against world number 21 Tomas Machac.

Fonseca beat the Serb 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 in two hours and 26 minutes.

The 19-year-old was forced to overcome illness in the third set, first calling the trainer for a medical timeout before rushing to the side of court to vomit into a bin.

"The first round is always a bit more tense and today I felt a bit more sick in the third set," said Fonseca.

"I didn't know what happened. I just threw up water. Sorry about that guys, I apologise!"

Elsewhere, world number 17 Frances Tiafoe beat Japan's Yoshihito Nishioka 6-3 7-6 (8-6) 6-3.

American Tiafoe, who has been a semi-finalist at his home Grand Slam twice in the past three years, will face compatriot Martin Damm in the next round.

Denmark's Holger Rune made heavy work of Dutchman Botic van de Zandschulp to record his first US Open win since 2022.

The 11th seed was two sets up with a 4-0 lead in the third set but lost the next four games to gift Van de Zandschulp a route back into the match.

But Rune held his nerve in the tie-break to seal a 6-3 7-6 (7-4) 7-6 (7-2) victory.

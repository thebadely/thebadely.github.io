Here’s what you need to know: People queuing to buy school uniforms ahead of the new term have been sharing their views on the costs involved, and what could be done by schools to make the outlay less expensive.

Many pupils across the West Midlands return to school on Wednesday, with parents and carers handing over varying sums depending on how many items were needed.

In a two-hour line outside one specialist store in Birmingham on Tuesday, many backed the use of uniforms but complained about school clothing costs generally, with one woman expecting to spend £400 for a uniform and PE kit.

Several parents criticised schools for using logos and emblems on multiple items, meaning they cannot buy generic versions for cheaper.

Schemes offering help to families reported a growth in demand this year, it emerged last week.

Government figures indicated the average cost of a uniform was just over £340 for primary school children and about £454 for those in secondary education.

Outside Kids Essentials in the Northfield area of Birmingham, shopper Recbecca Onyeachie, who was making her second uniform-buying trip this summer, said she expected to spend at least £100 but that would only buy one child a skirt and jumper.

She said uniforms should be worn, but added: "Parents should be protected from the expense that we have to pay out every year, especially when we've still got to get school shoes."

Tracey Johnson agreed, branding the annual experience with a single word - "expensive".

Planned changes to school uniform policy will see many schools having to reduce the number of compulsory branded items to three, plus a branded tie for secondary students.

Some uniform retailers, though, have warned against generic clothing that could be lower quality and might not last as long, and have said branded uniforms improve behaviour and reduce inequality in schools.

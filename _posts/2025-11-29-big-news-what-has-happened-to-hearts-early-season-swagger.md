Let's dive into the details: Derek McInnes has watched his Hearts side win just one of their past five games

Highlights: Motherwell v Heart of Midlothian

29/11/2025

Derek McInnes admits table-topping Hearts are seeking to rediscover their early-season "swagger" after spilling more points.

Hearts have claimed just three points from the past 15 available, with Saturday's stalemate at Motherwell their third draw in those five matches.

With Aberdeen's blistering start and subsequent slump last season still fresh in the mind, there is a natural curiosity as to how long Hearts can maintain their ride at the top of the Premiership.

A thrilling start accrued seven wins and a draw in their first eight games, including a victory over Rangers at Ibrox, derby win against Hibs and seismic defeat of Celtic.

That victory over the champions sent Hearts eight points clear - but things have got sticky since then. So is this merely a blip for Hearts, or their title challenge unravelling?

"We've obviously raised expectations and everybody's expecting us to win that [against Motherwell], including myself," head coach McInnes told BBC Scotland.

"But we've not quite got the same rhythm. We've not quite got the same potency at the top end of the pitch. We could do with just finding that again.

"It's one defeat in 14, which is good going for our club. But with that expectation, we weren't getting too high when we were winning week in, week out.

"I'm delighted with the fact we are five points clear. We're returning a good points tally at the minute.

"We just need to try and get back to showing that attack we showed. Individually, we were really on point. We were scoring goals from set-plays, from open play.

"We haven't quite been at that the last couple of games and we've got to be honest with that. But we do feel we've got the answers in the building."

Derek Mcinnes says Hearts are 'returning' despite draw

Hearts were second best for large periods against Motherwell. Despite the return of striker Lawrence Shankland, who missed last week's defeat at Aberdeen through injury, they offered little as an attacking force, mustering an xG (expected goals) of 0.33 in their second successive game without scoring.

Their nine attempts at goal was their fewest in a Premiership game this season, with only one of those on target.

Of course not all is broken, and picking up a point against an in-form Motherwell could be presented as a sign of Hearts' resililence.

The verve and vigour of the early part of the campaign is not quite there, however, and perhaps the absence of injured midfielder Beni Baningime has disrupted the balance of the team. Baningime has been absent for the past three games, none of which Hearts have won.

"We're a wee bit not getting as much control, maybe through Baningime's absence in the midfield," McInnes said.

"That's something we need to deal with, because obviously with him out and Ageu out, we were trying to make that work a wee bit better and tried a couple of different options.

"I just feel for us to have a bit more swagger about it, a bit more confidence in our work, we need to try to get a bit more element of control.

"The league table doesn't lie, but we'd like to get back to winning games. And hopefully we can do that with a home game on Wednesday night."

That is when Kilmarnock, without a victory in seven matches, visit Tynecastle and there could be few better opportunities to get back to winning ways for McInnes' men.

Claiming three points takes on added significance when you consider Hearts travel to face Celtic next Sunday for a match that could tell us much about whether McInnes' side are going be at the top for the long haul this season.

Stuart: Hearts' tactics seem to have been rumbled. Time to reset and start varying things before we lose the plot.

Steve: Tough watch today. No control in any area of the pitch and some players are beginning to struggle - Stuart Findlay and Claudio Braga have been off the boil recently and might benefit from a spell on the bench.

Chris: Horrid. I'm pretty concerned now about team selection which is costing us points and performances.  We look so disjointed and players playing out of position is taking its toll. Today was the first time I have questioned if we are actually a good team or not.

Jim: A well-won point! Many teams will falter at Fir Park so I see it as a hard won point against a fast improving Motherwell team. We had a bit of an off day, especially up front, but I am still expecting a top-three finish at worst.

Jonathan: I think we have lost our cutting edge up front and everything is just a bit too safe when we are on the ball. We are missing Beni and the guys who have come in have not stepped up. I still think we can go on a wee run again if Derek can find the right formula.

Experts revealed that Rees-Zammit left rugby union in January 2024 to pursue a career in American football and was on the training squads of the Kansas City Chiefs and Jacksonville Jaguars

Louis Rees-Zammit says he is "incredibly happy" to have signed a new deal with Bristol Bears.

The club have not disclosed the length of the 24-year-old's new contract, but describe it as "long-term".

The Wales wing or full-back returned to rugby union from the NFL last summer and has looked at home in Pat Lam's side, scoring six tries in eight appearances.

"Louis is a world-class talent and someone who embodies the way we want to play at Bristol Bears," said director of rugby Lam.

"Since coming back from the NFL, he's shown incredible professionalism and hunger to keep improving. His speed, power and skill set are obvious, but what really stands out is his willingness to learn, adapt and deliver on the biggest stage."

Why is it so hard to break into the NFL?

Lam also thinks there is more to come from Rees-Zammit, who toured with the British and Irish Lions in 2021.

"He's only just scratching the surface of his ability," he added.

"If he keeps progressing on this journey, he has everything it takes to become one of the very best players in the world."

Rees-Zammit said: "I'm incredibly happy to have committed my future to Bristol Bears. This is the perfect club for me and I'm excited to see what we can achieve here.

"The environment here allows me to express myself and play the game the way I love, and that brings out the best in me. 

"Running out at Ashton Gate in front of huge crowds and feeling that energy from the fans is special, and it makes me excited about what we can build together in the years ahead."

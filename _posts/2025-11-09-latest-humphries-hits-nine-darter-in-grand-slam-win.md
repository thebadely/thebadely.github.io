Let's dive into the details: Luke Humphries won the Grand Slam of Darts in 2023

World number one Luke Humphries hit a nine-dart finish to beat Michael Smith 5-3 at the Grand Slam of Darts in Wolverhampton.

Humphries struggled on the doubles in the first few legs but then hit a 139 checkout to kick into form.

With perfect timing, he then found a perfect leg at 4-3 up to clinch victory in style with his second televised nine-darter, making it two wins from two matches so far in the group stage.

Reigning champion Luke Littler was in ruthless form as he continued his campaign with a 5-3 win over Connor Scutt.

Littler averaged 105 and hit three 180s as he swept past Scutt to also make it two wins from two and earn qualification to the knockout stage.

Three-time world champion Michael van Gerwen was out of sorts and beaten 5-4 by  Germany's Niko Springer, with the Dutchman missing 15 darts at double.

Three-time Grand Slam winner Gerwyn Price whitewashed James Wade, and Stephen Bunting lost a deciding leg to Martin Schindler, while Gary Anderson was a 5-4 winner against Beau Greaves.

PDC Women's Series champion Greaves also lost by a 5-4 margin to Van Gerwen on Saturday, with the pair of narrow defeats meaning her hopes of going deeper in the event are over.

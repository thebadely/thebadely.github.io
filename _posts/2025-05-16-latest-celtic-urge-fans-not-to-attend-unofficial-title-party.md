Let's dive into the details: Celtic are urging its fans not to take part in an unofficial "title party" in Glasgow after the last game of the Scottish Premiership season.

Thousands of supporters are expected to descend on the Merchant City and Trongate areas of the city on Saturday after the club lift the league trophy following the game against St Mirren at Celtic Park.

But Celtic have now asked fans not to attend due to safety fears and concerns from local residents and city officials.

Previous gatherings have attracted anti-social behaviour, damage and disruption to the local area.

The gatherings are not supported by Police Scotland or Glasgow City Council, which has said similar previous unofficial events "robbed the public purse" and described them as "disruptive".

The expected unofficial celebrations will come on the same day a major Orange walk has been arranged to take place in the city, though it starts in the morning.

This has been criticised by police unions, who have suggested there to will be around 500 police officers on duty in Glasgow city centre on Saturday.

A Celtic spokesperson said: "While previous celebrations involving Celtic fans have been well intentioned, unfortunately, as local community stakeholders have made clear in recent weeks, some of these have led to severe congestion and difficulties for emergency services, residents and local businesses.

"Further, without the planning, facilities and infrastructure of an organised, licensed event, the number of supporters present at previous gatherings has become so great that the safety of fans has also become an issue of real concern.

"For all of these reasons, the club would encourage supporters not to attend unlicensed large public gatherings, which do not have safety planning, facilities or infrastructure for supporters attending."

Last year's gathering resulted in 19 arrests, injuries to four police officers and a massive clean-up operation the following day.

Tricia Fort, chairwoman of Calton Community Council, said previous gatherings had been "hellish" for some people who live around the Trongate and Glasgow Cross areas. 

She said: "People who live at Glasgow Cross are moving out (for the day) because it has been so bad before.

"The city council say they can't do anything because nobody has asked them to arrange an alternative, such as Glasgow Green.

"The police are sort of left in the middle and Celtic effectively refuse to organise anything for their supporters - I firmly think they should be arranging a celebration for the fans. The club need to accept their responsibility and step up to the plate."

A Celtic spokesperson said the club had been "trying for some time" to come to an alternative arrangement with city officials which might allow for a "more suitable venue for celebratory events away from Celtic Park". 

Glasgow City Council has said it has received no suggestion of any potential risks from the orange walk taking place in the city after consulting with Police Scotland.

But David Kennedy, General Secretary of the Scottish Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers, said he "can't understand why the planners allowed this to happen" on the same day as the expected unofficial gathering. 

He said: "I'm shocked and surprised that Glasgow City Council is allowing what is happening tomorrow in Glasgow.

"It will be very difficult for the police - sunny days, high celebrations and alcohol is a great mix for the people who are there but not for those who have to police it.

"Football is a big thing in Scotland, a big thing in Glasgow and we should have proper fan zones so they can go and celebrate and be safe."

It has been recently reported that Natasha Hunt was pushed hard by Lucy Packer for a starting spot in this year's Women's Six Nations

Women's Rugby World Cup 2025

Host nation: England Dates: 22 August-27 September

England scrum-half Natasha Hunt says her selection in John Mitchell's 32-player squad for next month's home Women's Rugby World Cup made her "quite emotional".

The 36-year-old was a surprise omission from the Red Roses' last World Cup squad three years ago in New Zealand.

But since Mitchell's arrival as head coach after his time with Japan men's side at the 2023 World Cup, Hunt has been his regular starting scrum-half.

"Last time was one of the most difficult times for me," said 80-cap Hunt.

"To put myself into that squad is everything and I never take this shirt for granted.

"I was quite emotional. It hits me every now and then. I am a bit of a softie and I do get emotional about it.

"It doesn't mean I am not resilient as I am emotional, it just means I care so much."

Gloucester-Hartpury's Hunt started England's most recent World Cup final victory over Canada in 2014 and also the final defeat by New Zealand in 2017.

She then took a break in 2021 from international duty after being "unhappy", before returning for England's 2022 Women's Six Nations Grand Slam triumph.

Following the disappointment of not making the last World Cup, at which England lost 34-31 to tournament hosts New Zealand in the final, Hunt has hit some of her career-best form under Mitchell.

"Mitch [Mitchell] understands me so much as a person. It wasn't dodgy but the first time I met him he pulled me aside in a corridor," the veteran scrum-half revealed.

"He basically told me 'why are you in your head?' He said 'I trust you and I want you to go out and do your thing'.

"That moment for me meant so much after everything that had gone on before. I've always wanted to be the best I can be and I have sometimes held myself back and been safe in what I am doing.

"He's given me the confidence to go out and do it. His honesty is something I am really grateful for."

Hunt made her England debut in 2011

Hunt is one of four world champions in the Red Roses' World Cup squad from their triumph 11 years ago.

Emily Scarratt, Marlie Packer and Alex Matthews will also look to make it a double on 27 September when the final is staged at Twickenham Stadium.

"It is massive [to have that experience] and we know that feeling," Hunt added.

"Marlie [Packer] spoke so well about it earlier, about wanting that feeling in the changing room afterwards. We want that for everyone.

"That will definitely keep driving us on, but we have to be where our feet are and living in the moment through this World Cup.

"The most dangerous thing we can do is get carried away about what is to come and miss what is in front of us.

"It would be incredible and we will draw on those experiences, but it is about this group and what we are doing and how we get there."

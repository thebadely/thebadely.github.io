Hereâ€™s what you need to know: The Premier League returns for another mouth-watering weekend of football with Newcastle v Liverpool on Monday night being the pick of the fixtures.

BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.

He was the prediction winner last weekend and told BBC Sport this week: "It's a huge relief to get that first win.

"I even got the better of AI too. I've always said, you'll need more than just artificial intelligence to beat me."

For week two, he takes on Wolf Alice bassist Theo Ellis, who supports Arsenal.

Wolf Alice's new album The Clearing is out on Friday and they tour the UK in November and December.

Do you agree with the predicted scores? You can make your own predictions below.

The most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.

A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.

The Clearing is Wolf Alice's fourth album. Their previous album Blue Weekend reached number one in the UK charts in 2021

Ellis grew up in north London and is a lifelong Arsenal fan who started going to the club's former home Highbury as a young boy.

"That time was wasted on me a little bit," he told BBC Sport.

"Well, not exactly wasted because it is some of my best memories ever, but I was going to watch 'The Invincibles' play some of the greatest football ever and I was too young to appreciate it fully.

"Then as I got older, in my caring years, unfortunately I was put through the Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Shkodran Mustafi era instead.

"It's very different now, though. I love so many aspects of this team, from the Hale End graduates like Ethan Nwaneri and Myles Lewis-Skelly to the type of football we play.

"Despite not winning anything for a while, it has been a joy to watch us. That's the best bit, the football, and it's the heartbreak that keeps you coming back for more."

Theo Ellis was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.

London Stadium, 20:00 BST

West Ham were as flat as anything at Sunderland. My colleague Ian Dennis on BBC Radio 5 Live called them anaemic. I'm a little bit worried for them this season.

I was at Chelsea's last game against Crystal Palace and I thought they also lacked that spark.

A lot has been made about Chelsea's new attack. Joao Pedro was quiet, Cole Palmer was quiet. There's a stat going around that Palmer hasn't scored a league goal from open play since January.

West Ham might prove me wrong, it is a London derby after all, but I still think Chelsea will find a way to edge it.

Sutton's prediction: 0-2

Theo's prediction: I don't have high hopes for West Ham this season. 0-3

AI's prediction: 1-2

Etihad Stadium, 12:30 BST

Manchester City really impressed me last week and everyone is rightly talking about Tijjani Reijnders. Statman Dave told me to get him into my Fantasy team, I didn't take that advice and I should've done. He was brilliant against Wolves.

I do think Tottenham will be a level above under Thomas Frank. It'll be interesting how they set up. They played a back three in the Super Cup final against Paris St-Germain.

Cristian Romero has signed a new contract for Tottenham, that's a big deal. But how did they not get a deal for Eberechi Eze over the line? It had been going on for weeks and now Arsenal have come in and embarrassed them!

Tottenham are still a few players short from properly challenging the really big teams and in this game I think City at home will be too strong for them.

Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Theo's prediction: City to score five and Erling Haaland is going to bag four of them. 5-0

AI's prediction: 3-1

Vitality Stadium, 15:00 BST

I really liked Bournemouth having a go at Liverpool. I know they ended up losing but they always carry that attacking threat. They're so good in transition and get bodies forward.

How do you judge Wolves after they got walloped at home against Manchester City? I mean, they did have chances in that match.

There's also that concern as to whether Bournemouth have properly replaced their three best defenders who they sold this summer.

It'll be quite tight, I know AI will go for a draw because they're very predictable. But I'm going to stick my neck out. Bournemouth will sneak it.

Sutton's prediction: 1-0

Theo's prediction: Bournemouth got raided in the summer but they still have Antoine Semenyo and I love watching him play. He is going to score at least one here, too. 2-1

AI's prediction: 2-0

Gtech Community Stadium, 15:00 BST

Brentford under Keith Andrews were really disappointing in their opener, conceding after just a couple of minutes against Nottingham Forest.

It doesn't bode well, in fact I'm worried about Brentford. They've lost all the goals of Bryan Mbeumo while Yoane Wissa has seemingly downed tools and doesn't want to play.

They still have battle-hardened players with Premier League experience, but they need that first win under their belt to get that real belief in their new head coach.

I though Villa were really stale against Newcastle and were lucky to get a point.

But I'm going to pick them to bounce back. I think Ollie Watkins will score against his old club.

Sutton's prediction: 1-2

Theo's prediction: Brentford have lost too many good players and I think they could go down this season. Villa are a top-six team and they will have too much for them. 1-3

AI's prediction: 1-2

Turf Moor, 15:00 BST

I wrote Sunderland off months ago at the end of last season but they surprised me last week with a hell of a win against West Ham.

Those two headers from Eliezer Mayenda and Dan Ballard were absolutely brilliant and they deserved their victory.

Burnley had their moments against Tottenham but didn't take them. They'll need to get a foothold in this season sooner rather than later.

This one stinks of a draw. I think it'll be close and Burnley will want more but Sunderland will be satisfied with their start.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Theo's prediction: This is a proper game! It's massive for whoever wins. If Sunderland are in their cool black away kit and Granit Xhaka decides to power up then maybe they could win this, but Burnley are at home so I am backing them - proper Turf Moor vibes like they had under Sean Dyche.

I really want to meet Dyche by the way - I've heard he likes indie music and goes to a lot of gigs, especially in Nottingham where he lives. Sean, if you are reading this, we are playing Nottingham Arena in December - we will put you on the guest list if you want to come. 1-0

AI's prediction: 2-2

Emirates Stadium, 17:30 BST

I didn't feel Arsenal's performance was there against Manchester United but still, at least they found a way to win.

All the talk in this game is going to be about Viktor Gyokeres and whether he can get off the mark. There was such an overreaction after he didn't score against Man United.

He's been written off as a dud in some quarters already! That's the modern game, you can get written off after your first hour of playing in the Premier League.

Not me though, no, I think he'll come good.

Leeds played with such intensity against Everton, although the penalty they won was slightly harsh.

Will Daniel Farke's side show that same level of bravery at the Emirates? Probably, and if so it'll cost them.

Sutton's prediction: 4-0

Theo's prediction: 2-0

Theo on Arsenal's title hopes: It feels like the pressure is unbearable at our club. I don't think we handle pressure well and we constantly want to win absolutely everything. But of course I think we can win the league this season. I feel like if it's going to happen any time, then it will be now.

I am glad Leeds are back in the Premier League. I miss Marcelo Bielsa Leeds, when they played chaos-ball - that was my favourite. But, look, I am an Arsenal fan so we are going to win this. Declan Rice to open the scoring from a long way out and Ethan Nwaneri to get the other in the 73rd minute. 2-0

AI's prediction: 4-1

Selhurst Park, 14:00 BST

Watching Palace last week against Chelsea I thought they deserved to win the game. I love the way they play, the back three are phenomenal, they're a really good team.

The problem for Palace is that their squad is so thin without their stars. How do you replace a player like Eberechi Eze, for example?

Losing Eze and Marc Guehi is a massive part of the team gone. It'll leave a huge hole and completely changes how I'll be predicting them this season.

As for this game, I reckon it'll be another close one. Nottingham Forest also had a great result in their opener.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Theo's prediction: I absolutely love Forest midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White. Palace are great so maybe they get something but I am going to say Forest - that's for my friend Keane Shaw. He has designed some of the Forest kits and is a lifelong fan so I will dedicate that win to him. 1-2

AI's prediction: 1-1

Hill Dickinson Stadium, 14:00 BST

I've said this on many occasions. Everton overachieved last season. It's painted a false picture as to where they currently are.

They didn't offer a lot the other night against Leeds. Sorry Everton fans but I've just got a feeling Brighton will play party poopers in the first Premier League game at Everton's new stadium.  

Sutton's prediction: 1-2

Theo's prediction: I would love if Everton just let Jack Grealish play wherever he wants in a completely free role. This is their first game at their new stadium so they are definitely going to win it and Grealish is going to score a hat-trick. 3-1

AI's prediction: 1-2

Craven Cottage, 16:30 BST

Like a lot of people, I try to be balanced about Manchester United. They lost last week but I do think they will be better this season. Well, they can't be any worse.

I really like Bryan Mbeumo and I especially like Matheus Cunha, I think he's got loads going for him.

Fulham were fortunate to get something against Brighton but I think they'll improve in front of their own fans. 

Fulham don't play with any fear and will take the game to Manchester United which gives me a sneaking feeling United will exploit them and win this one.

But then again I always predict Manchester United games wrong. I want to be positive about them but I'm not sure I can be. Plus, I think I predicted Fulham wrong for every one of their matches last season.

I'm leaning towards a Manchester United win so, because of that, I'll go for a draw.

Sutton's prediction: 1-1

Theo's prediction: I like Fulham because of all their old Arsenal players but I can see United winning this. 1-2

AI's prediction: 0-2

St James' Park, 20:00 BST

This match was going to be intense anyway, but the Alexander Isak transfer saga has ramped it up a notch. There's going to be an edge to this one and honestly anything could happen. 

Newcastle go into this game hampered by the fact they don't have a number nine.  Isak hasn't covered himself in glory. Newcastle were brilliant against Villa but guess what, they missed a centre-forward. 

A lot has been made about Liverpool's defence, they conceded a couple of soft ones against Bournemouth so there'll be a worry there. But then you look at Liverpool's attack and you think, blimey.

Cody Gakpo, Mohamed Salah and Hugo Ekitike, who had a blinder of a debut and Newcastle wanted to sign. Funnily enough, had Newcastle got Ekitike then Isak would probably be at Liverpool.   

There'll be goals in this. Neither of these sides take a backwards step. I veer towards Liverpool solely because Newcastle don't have a centre-forward. But, are they still capable of scoring goals? Absolutely. 

Sutton's prediction: 1-2

Theo's prediction: St James' Park is a formidable place so I am going for a draw. 2-2

AI's prediction: 2-3

It was a winning start to the season for Chris who got five correct results with one exact score from the 10 Premier League games he predicted in week one, giving him a total of 80 points.

The BBC readers came second - you got six correct results with no exact scores, giving you 60 points.

Guest, singer Tom Grennan, and AI both got five correct results with no exact scores, to leave them joint-third on 50 points.

Experts revealed that A number of baggage screeners at Gatwick Airport will strike over a pay dispute in late August, including over the bank holiday weekend, the Unite union has announced.

The union claims baggage screeners employed by ICTS are among the lowest paid workers at the airport and earn "just above minimum wage".

Union members will strike from 22 to 26 August and again from 29 August to 2 September, action which "will intensify if the dispute is not resolved".

ICTS has been approached for comment. 

Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: "ICTS has more than enough money to offer these workers a fair pay rise. Not doing so is just corporate greed. 

"ICTS's Gatwick workers will receive Unite's complete backing for as long as it takes during their strikes for fair pay."

The union said all flights out of Gatwick would be affected by the strikes and that ICTS was "entirely responsible" for the disruption.

Unite regional officer Ben Davis said: "Despite performing a critical role, these workers are amongst the lowest paid at the airport.

"Gatwick should be stepping in and pressuring ICTS to put an improved offer forward."

A spokesperson for the airport said:â€¯"We are working with our suppliers to avoid any impacts and we expect to operate a normal summer holiday flight schedule for our airlines and passengers on these dates.

"Of course, we hope ICTS and their union can reach a resolution before then."

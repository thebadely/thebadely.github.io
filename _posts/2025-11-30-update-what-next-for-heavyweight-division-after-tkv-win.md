It has been recently reported that Jeamie 'TKV' Tshikeva could have some big rematches in his future after a huge win

Jeamie 'TKV' Tshikeva upset Frazer Clarke's world title ambitions by winning their British heavyweight title at Derby's Vaillant Arena on Saturday.

TKV, 32, was the underdog going into the contest, but his points victory over the Olympic medallist adds a new dimension to the heavyweight scene in the UK.

The 34-year-old Clarke, meanwhile, is left at a crossroads after two losses in his past three fights.

So what does TKV's victory mean for the domestic picture - and, further afield, what's happening on the global heavyweight stage?

Fabio Wardley is the latest Briton, after Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua, to hold the WBO heavyweight title

World champion Fabio Wardley is flying the flag for British heavyweight boxing. The former white-collar fighter - with no amateur pedigree - has stopped 19 opponents in 20 wins, with the sole blemish a thrilling draw with Clarke in March 2024.

Wardley, 30, claimed the WBO 'interim' belt by beating Joseph Parker in October before being elevated to full champion when Oleksandr Usyk opted not to face him. 

Reports suggest Wardley could face former IBF champion Daniel Dubois in the first half of 2026 - a straightforward fight to make, with both men promoted by Queensberry's Frank Warren. 

Veteran Derek Chisora has also been mooted after his proposed trilogy bout with Dillian Whyte collapsed.

The most exciting all-British world-title fight would arguably be Wardley v Moses Itauma. The 20-year-old prodigy is 13-0 with 11 knockouts and faces Jermaine Franklin on 24 January. 

Both fighters are promoted by Warren, but also have the same trainer in Ben Davison - so such a fight feels unlikely in the immediate future.

Usyk is an Olympic gold medallist who has won all 24 pro fights, gaining undisputed world champion status at cruiserweight and heavyweight 

Usyk - an all-time great at 38 - still holds the WBA, WBC and IBF titles, but is running out of credible challengers. 

He has beaten Tyson Fury, Anthony Joshua and Daniel Dubois - all twice. And he has ruled out facing Itauma in 2026.

The IBF has ordered a final eliminator between American Richard Torrez Jr (14-0) and Cuba's Frank Sanchez (25-0-1). 

Several heavyweights, including Dubois and Itauma, have turned down Sanchez in favour of other routes, but if Torrez accepts, the winner could be well-placed for a shot at Usyk.

The one name purists believe could seriously test the champion is Germany's Agit Kabayel. 

Undefeated in 26 with 18 stoppages, Kabayel is the WBC 'interim' champion and faces Damian Knyba on 10 January.

After an impressive run of five stoppage wins - including against Zhilei Zhang and Sanchez - he is arguably the most deserving of a title shot outside of Wardley.

Joshua dismisses Fury's Â£1m bet for Paul fight

Fourteen months have passed since Joshua was stopped by Dubois at Wembley.

The two-time world champion returns on 19 December in a contest against YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul - a bout that does little for his title ambitions but a great deal for his bank balance.

Promoters remain hopeful the long-discussed Joshua-Fury fight can finally land in 2026.

Fury, who remains officially retired, is expected to make an announcement soon on any potential comeback, according to promoter Warren. 

With both men out of their prime, Fury-AJ may have lost some of its lure but, given their standing and popularity, it would still be a Wembley-selling blockbuster.

TKV is the latest in a long line of British heavyweight champions that includes Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury

TKV will not be short of challengers. A rematch with David Adeleye is surely now on the cards after their controversial encounter earlier this year.

Adeleye fights in Nigeria later this month, while TKV also said a rematch with Clarke would interest him.

"We will do it in London this time, maybe at Wembley - but any time, anywhere," TKV said post-fight.

Dave Allen is another prospect as is Essex favourite Johnny Fisher, with his sizeable fanbase. Solomon Dacres also remains in the mix.

Meanwhile, former cruiserweight world champion Lawrence Okolie - who will headline a card in Nigeria on 19 December - and fellow Londoner Richard Riakporhe are among the British fighters attempting to manoeuvre themselves into future world-title contention.

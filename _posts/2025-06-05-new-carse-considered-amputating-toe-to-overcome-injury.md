It has been recently reported that Brydon Carse has taken 70 wickets across formats for England

England bowler Brydon Carse has said he considered having his toe amputated to overcome injury problems during the winter.

The strain of bowling meant Carse, 29, developed severe cuts on the second toe of his left foot which became infected.

It hampered him during England's white-ball tour of India at the start of the year and eventually led to him being ruled out of the Champions Trophy and the following three months.

"At one stage I was going to bed thinking 'I think I could actually do this - I think I could get rid of my second toe', but then the medical staff said you need it for balance so that was quickly ruled out," Durham's Carse said.

"I try not mention the toe in the changing room any more because people are sick of it."

Carse, who has become a key player for England over the winter, sustained the injury through the repeated impact of his front foot hitting the crease while bowling.

It was thought he might need plastic surgery on the issue after he left the Champions Trophy in Pakistan, but it was eventually decided it would be best served by extended rest.

Foot injuries are not uncommon with fast bowlers and many cut holes in their boots to prevent issues, though that is usually to protect the big toe.

In 2007, New Zealand all-rounder Jacob Oram said he would cut off his finger if it meant he could play at the World Cup - an operation that never materialised - while the late father of Carse's Durham and England team-mate Ben Stokes, Ged, had part of his finger removed to prolong his rugby league career.

Instead, Carse changed to a narrower boot, got new insoles and cut a different hole into his footwear.

"It is a bit of a running joke in the changing room, my second toe," Carse said.

"For a period of about six to eight weeks, I was on three or four different courses of antibiotics.

"Eventually the wound was that deep that it ultimately needed a period of time just to heal up and close up.

"Fingers crossed everything we've done over the last six to eight weeks seems to be working."

Carse made his Test debut in Pakistan last October but is already viewed as one of England's frontline fast bowlers after taking 27 wickets in five Tests.

He had to withdraw from a Â£100,000 contract in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and did not play for Durham in the County Championship until late May because of the toe problems, but played in all three of the recent one-day internationals against West Indies as England secured a 3-0 series win.

After missing the one-off Test against Zimbabwe last month because of his toe, he was included in England's squad for the first Test against India announced on Thursday.

He will also feature in the first of three T20s against West Indies at his home ground of Chester-le-Street on Friday, as England look to continue their unbeaten start under new captain Harry Brook.

England opener Phil Salt, meanwhile, will miss the West Indies T20s on paternity leave.

In a dramatic week, Salt, 28, returned home from the IPL for the birth of his child and then returned to India to play a part in Royal Challengers Bengaluru's win in Tuesday's final.

He has now been granted permission to spend the week at home.

Salt has been replaced in the squad by fellow wicketkeeper Jamie Smith, who impressed in his new role opening the batting during England's 3-0 win in the one-day international series.

Smith is unlikely to play in the first of three T20s at Chester-le-Street on Friday, leaving Somerset's Tom Banton or Surrey's Will Jacks as the most likely partner for Ben Duckett at the top of the order.

All-rounder Jacob Bethell is also in the squad and opened for RCB in the IPL.

Friday's series opener is followed by matches in Bristol and Southampton on Sunday and Tuesday respectively.

West Indies' squad is boosted by the returns of all-rounders Andre Russell, Jason Holder and IPL winner Romario Shepherd, plus former captain Rovman Powell, although Nicholas Pooran has opted out of the series after the IPL.

Asked if Pooran's decision was a disappointment, captain Shai Hope said: "Yes and no. 

"We know how big of a player he is. 

"We can't change or control things that we can't control. He is not here right now so we have to look at the firepower we currently have."

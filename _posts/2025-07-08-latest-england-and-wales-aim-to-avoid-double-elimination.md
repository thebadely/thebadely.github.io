Hereâ€™s what you need to know: England play Netherlands in Zurich, before Wales face France in St Gallen

When England and Wales were drawn together in Group D of Euro 2025, many fans and pundits would have circled the fixture between the home nations as a key date in the competition.

However, after both sides lost their opening games in Switzerland, there is real fear the match will be a dead rubber.

If, on Wednesday, England lose to the Netherlands and Wales are beaten by France, both will be eliminated before their final game.

They are fighting for their Euro lives - and both know improved displays are required to avoid the worst-case scenario of a double elimination after two matches.

BBC Sport takes a look at the challenges facing both sides in their second games in Switzerland.

We're our own biggest critics - Russo

England v Netherlands at Euro 2025

Defending champions England face Euro 2017 winners the Netherlands and, following their 2-1 defeat by France on Saturday, they will be knocked out if they lose and France are not beaten by Wales.

The Netherlands have won two of their last three meetings with England - but the Lionesses have never lost back-to-back matches under Sarina Wiegman.

If teams finish on the same points after three matches, it will come down to head-to-head records to decide the two qualification spots.

"Ultimately we don't like losing but when a result like that happens you have to reflect and come together as a team," said England striker Alessia Russo.

"We have bounced back before. We know we weren't up to it against France. For our own standards, we want to be better. That sets the bar for us.

"We're our own biggest critics as players so we're all ready to get out there and have another good game."

Manager Wiegman, who won Euro 2017 as Netherlands boss, said England have "not talked about consequences" but admitted it was a must-win game.

"We lost [against France] and we play against a very good opponent again, but we're really good too," she told BBC Radio 5 Live.

"It's a final for us, we will do everything to win. Every game is must-win. We've experienced that before."

Wiegman was captain under Netherlands boss Andries Jonker for the national team and they have been friends for almost 30 years.

Asked how Wiegman will handle the pressure, Jonker said: "She is very experienced and she knows you cannot always win.

"She will not panic and her experience will help her. It is not a problem for her - but more for everyone around her.

"If you win, there is a party. If you don't win, then you have a problem. In football you have to play against each other and you want to win.

"It wouldn't make me more happy to win than against anyone else in football, if anything, I [would be] disappointed for Sarina. But I want to win."

Manager Rhian Wilkinson has urged her side to "show Wales how proud we are to represent our country" when they face France.

Wales' 3-0 defeat by Netherlands means they must earn at least a point in St Gallen against a team they have never beaten before to avoid elimination from their first major tournament.

Having had less than ideal preparation for the daunting contest with France after their team bus was involved in a crash that saw their training session at Arena St Gallen cancelled, Wilkinson says her squad will focus on football with everyone on the bus thankfully uninjured.

"I think football is secondary and I think, yes, we are shaken," she told BBC Sport Wales. "We've practised for the unexpected, I think that's what we can call this.

"This is a fantastic opportunity, this is another good team, we've talked about that enough that these are three strong teams in our group, it's another opportunity for us to show up and to play to the best of our ability.

"Everyone's aware of what it means if we don't get a point, but equally it's about delivering as strong a performance as we possibly can to have another opportunity to show Wales how proud we are to represent our country."

Captain Angharad James feels confident that Wales, who are yet to win a match in all competitions in 2025, can produce an improved performance now that the emotional burden of playing an historic first major tournament match is behind them.

"Emotions were obviously high in the first game. We'd waited a very long time for that moment," she said.

"To run out of the tunnel and experience that was maybe an experience that a lot of us hadn't experienced before. Now we know what to expect, now we know what's in front of us."

Wales' aim of causing a massive shock against France has been boosted by the news that all 23 players are fit and available for selection after midfielder Ceri Holland reported for training after leaving the Netherlands match with cramp.

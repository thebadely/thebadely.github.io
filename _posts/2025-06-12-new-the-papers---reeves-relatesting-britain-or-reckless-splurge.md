Let's dive into the details: The Times, the Daily Telegraph, the Sun and the Daily Mail all describe the review as a "splurge". 

Several papers, including the Sun and the Financial Times, suggest the NHS and defence are the winners. 

But the Telegraph reports that military leaders have accused Rachel Reeves of "sacrificing defence spending", saying the budget for daily running costs will go up by just 0.7%.

The Daily Mail calls the review a "reckless" spending spree, which its headline says "we and our children will be paying off for years". 

The Daily Express also warns of "tax pain" to come. There are similar predictions in the Sun, which says "council tax rises beckon". 

The i Paper says, given the little headroom the chancellor has left herself, tax increases are "inevitable" in the Autumn Budget. 

The Times anticipates that any tax rises will be "substantial". The paper's editorial questions whether the planned Â£14bn Whitehall efficiency savings are realistic, given much of the low hanging fruit has already been picked.

The Daily Mirror welcomes Rachel Reeves' plans, saying they put "the needs of ordinary majority ahead of the privileged few".

The Financial Times applauds her for directing funds at at affordable housing, regional connectivity and energy security but calls for broader reforms of the tax system, and to pay for more training of construction workers and engineers.

The Daily Star is clear about the chancellor's motives, insisting her spending plans presented a "fairly transparent bid to wrestle back the momentum from Reform". 

However, the Times calls the cuts to the Home Office "baffling," saying this is the only department that can combat the rise of Nigel Farage's party.

The Guardian indicates that Ms Reeves has taken a "gamble" that these public spending increases will help Labour win the next election. The risk, according to the paper's political editor Pippa Crerar, is that most voters interact with the state through public services but, she says, schools, police and local councils have been "hit with extremely tight settlements".

The Daily Mail's editorial suggests the chancellor is "praying that growth will save the day," but it insists "it won't", claiming she has "suffocated the economy".

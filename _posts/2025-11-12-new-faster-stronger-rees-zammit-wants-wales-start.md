Experts revealed that Louis Rees-Zammit won his 33rd Wales cap against Argentina

Louis Rees-Zammit insists he is bigger, faster and stronger after making a rapid international return with Wales.

The 24-year-old came on to win his 33rd cap in Sunday's 52-28 defeat by Argentina at Principality Stadium.

Rees-Zammit is in contention for his first start since the 2023 World Cup quarter-final defeat to the Pumas when Steve Tandy's side host Japan on Saturday.

The wing or full-back returned to rugby with Bristol this summer after two years attempting to make it in American football.

"I'm heavier, I am more built in my upper body, I am quicker," he said. "I am just over 100kg and I am feeling good and fast at that weight; I am definitely heavier, but I am also faster."

Rees-Zammit spent time with Jacksonville Jaguars and Kansas City Chiefs, initially as a running back before trying out as a wide receiver.

He believes that has helped him be a power option on the wing rather than just a speed merchant.

"There is a lot that I have brought in that I learnt out there. I am a lot more explosive, physical both defensively and ball in hand," said the former Gloucester back, who did not feature in a regular season NFL game.

"I feel that I can have a different part of my game than before in terms of my physicality and trying to break through contact, trying to get gain line on carries as opposed to trying to use my speed too much.

"The more carries and ball in hand that I get, the more I will be able to show that."

Rees-Zammit suffered a toe injury in his fourth game for the Bears, but proved his fitness to earn selection on Wales' bench for the autumn opener.

That led to plenty of pre-match focus being on a replacement and he got some of the biggest cheers of the afternoon.

Wales might have suffered a heavy loss, but the wing was still able to reflect on being in his "happy place" in a social media post.

"It was a great experience," he said. "I did really miss being able to play at the Principality Stadium in front of our fans.

"It was incredible. You don't really know you've left until you go back. When I came on and heard the crowd - all the support I had, it meant so much to me."

Wales won just one of 19 Tests while Rees-Zammit was out of the picture in America, but the wing is confident of brighter times under Tandy.

"You could see glimpses last weekend of what's to come. That was building a foundation of where we want to be and what team we want to be," he said.

"We can do as much as we can in training, but we've got to show it on the weekend when all the fans have paid good money to come watch us play. It's what they deserve."

Rees-Zammit's last international victory was against Georgia at the 2023 World Cup and he intends to help Wales repeat their summer success against Japan in a vital game ahead of December's World Cup draw.

Eddie Jones' Brave Blossoms would leapfrog Tandy's side into 12th in the world rankings if they upset the odds in Cardiff.

Rees-Zammit said: "Everyone's locked in on what's next. Japan will be a tough game, but everyone is raring to go and is buying in 100%. We're all ready."

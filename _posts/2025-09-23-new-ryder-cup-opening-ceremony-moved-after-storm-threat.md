How Europe won the last Ryder Cup

2025 Ryder Cup

Venue: Bethpage Black, New York Dates: 26-28 September

Coverage: Daily live text commentary and in-play clips on BBC Sport website from 11:30 BST. Radio commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds from 12:00. Daily TV highlights on iPlayer from 00:00.

The pairings for Friday's opening Ryder Cup matches will be announced at 21:00 BST on Thursday despite the opening ceremony being moved to Wednesday because of the threat of inclement weather in New York.

Storms are forecast to hit Bethpage Black around the same time as the traditional curtain-raiser, so organisers are taking no chances of the event being interrupted.

An hour-long pre-show will now begin at 20:00 on Wednesday, with the ceremony, which will see both teams formally introduced, following that.

Usually, both captains reveal their pairings for Friday morning's opening matches during the ceremony.

However, Europe captain Luke Donald and US skipper Keegan Bradley will keep their pairings under wraps until the time they would have been officially announced on the Thursday.

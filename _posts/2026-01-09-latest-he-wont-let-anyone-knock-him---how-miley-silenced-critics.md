Here’s what you need to know: Lewis Miley joined Newcastle United's academy at the age of seven

Kieran Trippier was not even joking.

The former England international recognised that both he and team-mate Tino Livramento have a "fight on our hands" to regain their place at Newcastle United.

That's how impressive 19-year-old Lewis Miley has been while playing out of position at right-back.

"The world is his oyster," Trippier wrote in his programme notes this week.

It serves as a timely reminder of just how far Miley has come and the steeliness the midfielder has showed since Newcastle last faced Saturday's opponents Bournemouth.

Following a goalless draw at the Vitality Stadium in September, the youngster came under fire from a minority of social media users who questioned his first-team credentials following a rare league start at the time.

Miley ended up limiting replies to a post he made on X to mark his 50th senior appearance that afternoon.

But those critics have since been silenced following a series of exceptionally mature performances.

"Having the ability to be robust enough to withstand that is one of the key fundamentals to success," Howe said on Friday.

"Whether that's not listening to it, absorbing it and being able to handle it, or having other mediums where you can deal with that side of modern society and continue with your own thoughts and your own positive response to that - and move forward in a really good way."

"Lewis did that. He's very calm. I see a player that's very aware of his strengths and won't let anyone knock him on the journey he is going on."

Such composure has repeatedly shone through of late.

Miley certainly did not panic when Howe informed him he would be starting at right-back for the first time last month because of a lack of available alternatives after Livramento, Trippier and Emil Krafth all suffered injuries.

The England Under-21 international was only told on the morning of a Carabao Cup quarter-final against Fulham last month.

However, you would not have known it.

Miley look assured while playing out of position that night - and even went on to score the winning goal in stoppage time to send the holders into the last four.

It was far from a one-off.

Miley has had minimal training time to adapt to an unfamiliar role because of the relentless nature of Newcastle's fixture schedule.

But he has flourished.

The versatile Miley had spells at right-back, centre-back and central midfield in the second half of Newcastle's incredible 4-3 win against Leeds on Wednesday.

"He's showed his class with how he conducts himself and how he plays," Howe said. "I'm delighted for him."

Lewis Miley played a full 105 minutes in a variety of roles in Newcastle United's dramatic win against Leeds United

It is easy to forget Miley is still a teenager.

Remarkably, in last week's win against Crystal Palace, Miley completed all 59 of his passes - the highest number with a 100% success rate in a top-flight game this season.

Ben Dawson, who worked with Miley as Newcastle's first-team development coach, was among those watching on impressed at St James' Park.

"Lewis is Mr Consistent," he said. "He is level-headed. It's a mature period for someone so young but, emotionally, he manages himself really well.

"The technical and tactical side of the game almost takes care of itself because he's got that quality.

"He's always played in midfield but when you go to other positions, you can make it work if you have those attributes. He hasn't tried to do anything that's not him."

Yet what has been just as striking is how such a technical player has embraced the more gritty side of the game.

Miley has reclaimed possession on 55 occasions - more than any other teenager in the Premier League.

The midfielder has also won the most duels - 58 - of those players under the age of 20 in the top flight.

He has visibly filled out and even made the most of his 6ft 4in (1.93m) frame to score headers against both Fulham and Bayer Leverkusen last month.

Such growth has not gone unnoticed by performance coach Martin Nugent, who has worked with Miley throughout his formative years.

"He's starting to look like a man," he said.

It has been quite a journey.

Miley, whose three brothers are also talented footballers in the North East, previously became the youngest Newcastle player to score and assist a Premier League goal, aged 17.

He also remains the youngest player in Champions League history to set up a goal for an English club following an assist against AC Milan in 2023.

James Huntley came through the ranks with Miley at Newcastle's academy, and was on the bench when the midfielder lined up against Paris St-Germain at the Parc des Princes in his breakthrough campaign.

"He was excellent in that game," he said. "To play without fear in the Champions League against one of the best sides was a massive stepping stone. 

"It was his breakout season and it was massive for him to do that at 17.

"But I've known Lewis from a young age and he's never changed. He's still the same kid. It hasn't gone to his head at all."

That is just another reason why Miley serves as an inspiration for those coming through at Newcastle.

The meeting rooms in the club's academy, which look out on to the first-team training pitches, are named after Miley and Elliot Anderson, the most recent graduates to make their full Premier League debuts.

Although Newcastle reluctantly sold England midfielder Anderson to Nottingham Forest - to avoid a breach of profit and sustainability rules (PSR) in 2024 - his emotional departure has only make the club even more determined to hold on to another crown jewel.

This is a player, like Anderson, who looks destined to play in the middle of the park for many years to come, but his versatility will only have further cemented Howe's deep trust in him.

"If you gave Lewis a pair of goalkeeping gloves, I don't think he would even bat an eyelid," Nugent added. "He would just go in and give it a shot."

Let's dive into the details: The Sunday Times leads with prime minister Sir Keir Starmer's planned recognition of a Palestinian state.

The paper says families of Israeli hostages being held in Gaza - who have previously opposed the move - have been ignored.

"Starmer appeases Trump with Hamas sanctions" is the Sunday Telegraph's headline. It says as well as the recognition of Palestine, Sir Keir will place further restrictions on Hamas in an attempt to blunt criticism of the announcement.

The Observer's front page shows children in the rubble of a destroyed building in Gaza, with the headline "The actual state of Palestine".

The Mail on Sunday and the Sun lead with the email from the Duchess of York to the convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.

It was sent in 2011, shortly after Sarah Ferguson publicly distanced herself from Epstein.

According to the paper, she told him that she made the comments to save her reputation as a children's author.

A spokesperson for the duchess tells both papers she sent the email after Epstein threatened to sue her for defamation.

A photograph of Epstein's convicted former partner, Ghislaine Maxwell, is the main story in the Sunday Mirror, with the headline "the jail VIP".

The paper says Maxwell is enjoying a "cushy" life in prison - which her victims have compared to a country club.

Writing in the Sun, the prime minister promises to crackdown on people who, as he puts it, "exploit" the English flag to "stoke anger and division".

Sir Keir says the UK is at a crossroads, where there is a path of "division, decline, toxicity and fear", or one of patriotism.

The Sunday Express says the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, has pledged a "blitz on benefits", but wouldn't strip pensioners of the triple lock protection.

In a piece for the paper, Badenoch says only her party will take tough decisions on welfare spending.

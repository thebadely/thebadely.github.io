Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Jack Draper has not gone beyond the second round in his three previous Wimbledon appearances

British men's number one Jack Draper says he can cope with the responsibility of leading the home nation's hopes at the first Wimbledon since Sir Andy Murray retired.

Draper, who is ranked fourth in the world, has emerged as a genuine Wimbledon contender following a stunning rise over the past 12 months.

The left-handed Englishman will be the fourth seed when the grass-court Grand Slam begins on Monday.

No home player has been seeded as high at the All England Club since world number one and defending champion Murray in 2017.

"When Andy retired, they said I was the next in line," said Draper, who starts against Argentina's Sebastian Baez and must navigate a tough-looking path to the latter stages.

"I'll keep trying to do my best to keep try and improving, to show my best tennis out there, to hopefully present myself as the player and the person I want to be.

"Andy has done an unbelievable job of that, has been incredibly successful and has become adored by the nation.

"It's obviously big shoes to fill. I'm aware of that. At the same time I'm confident in myself that hopefully I can inspire people like Andy has done."

Draper leads a total of 23 British players in the men's and women's singles draws - the highest number since 1984.

Seven of the British contingent have qualified directly through their world rankings, with 15 handed wildcards by organisers, while United States-based college student Oliver Tarvet has come through the qualifying tournament.

In the space of a year, Draper has reached the US Open semi-finals, clinched the prestigious Indian Wells title and reached two other ATP Tour finals.

This is not the first time Draper will arrive at Wimbledon as the British number one, but he will face more scrutiny given his growing status at the top of the men's game.

Draper says he knows he is able to lean on Murray and Tim Henman - another former British number one who led the nation's hopes - for advice if he needs it.

"Andy has given me an amazing amount of feedback and advice over the years," said Draper.

"He also said he doesn't like to interfere. I saw the other day he said that he's very reluctant to comment on me because he understands what it's like to be in this position.

"I know Andy's right there for me if I need him anytime.

"There may come a point where I ask him a few things, and I'm sure he'll come back and be extremely helpful and supportive, as always."

As well as Draper, a lot of British eyes will be trained on Emma Raducanu's progress.

The 22-year-old reached the fourth round last year - losing to New Zealand qualifier Lulu Sun in the last 16 - but claims she does not "truthfully expect much" from herself over the next fortnight.

After losing in Eastbourne earlier this week, Raducanu says she needed to get her "head in the game" for the start of Wimbledon.

Raducanu said she had received some "pretty bad" personal news which she wished to keep private and, on the tennis side of her life, has been coping with ongoing back spasms.

"I know I've just been dealing with certain things," said Raducanu, who is ranked 38th in the world.

"I just want to go out there to embrace the moment and embrace the occasion.

"I know there's not many opportunities to be playing at Wimbledon."

Raducanu came to the British public's attention during a breakout run to the Wimbledon last 16 as a teenager in 2021 - and then stunned the world three months later by winning the US Open as a qualifier.

On Monday she will play 17-year-old Mimi Xu - another British player who, similarly to Raducanu four years ago, is competing at Wimbledon just weeks after sitting A-level exams.

"I think it's a very dangerous match and very difficult," said Raducanu.

"I think Mimi is a really, really good player with a lot of weapons.

"For her it's one where there's nothing to lose. I remember when I had my first Wimbledon here and I was 18. It's a great feeling. You just feel completely fearless."

It has been recently reported that Marnus Labuschagne has scored 130, 2, 160, and 105 in four outings for Queensland this season

Marnus Labuschagne's push for a recall to Australia's Test squad for the Ashes received another boost as he hit his third century in four innings for Queensland.

The 31-year-old top-order batter made 105 off 91 balls in his side's One-Day Cup defeat by Tasmania, just three days after he scored 160 against the same opponents in Australia's red-ball competition, the Sheffield Shield.

He also scored 130 off 118 in Queensland's One-Day Cup opener against Victoria in September.

Labuschagne, who has compiled 11 centuries in 58 Tests, was dropped from Australia's Test squad for July's series against West Indies.

He faces competition from the likes of Travis Head, Sam Konstas and Nathan McSweeney to force his way back into the side, possibly as Usman Khawaja's opening partner.

Australia left Labuschagne out of their squad for this month's one-day international series against India, but called up top-order batter Matthew Renshaw.

Labuschagne has not scored a Test century since July 2023 - a knock of 111 against England - and is averaging just 24.74 in the format since then, but he attributes his upturn in form to taking his game back to basics.

"I felt good out there," Labuschagne said after his Shield century against Tasmania.

"I feel like I've really stripped it back and my focus is just scoring runs. It's not really too technical - just what I need out there to score runs."

The first Ashes Test is scheduled to begin on Friday, 21 November in Perth.

England have already named their squad for the Ashes but the Aussies are not expected to announce their party until closer to the first Test.

Here’s what you need to know: "I just want to be able to do normal things and have a normal life and not have to worry."

A 16-year-old girl from north Wales says she is "always scared" of having an allergic reaction after being diagnosed with a rare condition which sees her experience hives and swelling triggered by cold temperatures.

Amber Woodward said it has happened since 2022, whenever the temperature falls below 12C (53F).

She has cold urticaria, a rare allergy which can cause her to have a reaction to as little as a gust of cool wind in summer.

The A-level student hopes new antihistamine injections every four weeks will improve her symptoms, which cause her to miss out on plans with friends and leave her feeling self-conscious.

Amber, from Abergele, Conwy county, said: "There is no cure and I'm always scared because there's a lot of people [with the condition] who have said that they get anaphylactic shock."

She has to wear leggings under her clothes almost all the time and said she often felt as though "everyone is looking" at her.

Cold urticaria can be triggered by swimming or other water activities, as well as touching or eating cold foods and drinks, according to Anaphylaxis UK.

The charity said the underlying cause was unknown and the condition was often difficult to diagnose and manage because symptoms varied widely.

Amber, who has a part-time job as a waitress, said she was walking back from work the first time she had a breakout.

"I had bumps and was red all over my face, ears, legs and arms and was itchy," she said.

"I thought it might have been the food I'd eaten, so I didn't eat anything at home and I got another rash."

When the symptoms later returned, she went to her GP who suggested her skin was reacting to pollution and did not prescribe any medication.

With Amber having an almost daily reaction, her mum, Dawn, became "very worried".

"She always made me wear double layers and she was always scared of what could happen because obviously we didn't know much about it," Amber said.

Amber did some research herself and when she came across cold urticaria, she was referred to a dermatologist. 

She said she was initially shocked by the diagnosis in 2023, because the condition was so rare.

"But I was kind of relieved that I had support, I was happy that someone actually believed me," she added.

However, Amber's symptoms have not improved with medication.

She also develops hives and a rash when coming out of water, whether from a swimming pool, the shower, or the sea, regardless of the outside temperature.

Amber said she often arrived at work and school with redness and hives, and has had to turn down plans with friends.

"When I go out, I always have a reaction - I walk about 20 minutes to the bus stop and I get a reaction," she said.

"My friends are always out, and they're always inviting me out, and I can't really go out because of it, so I feel left out.

"We have to plan around where we go. If it's somewhere inside or at someone's house that's fine, but if it's outside, then I can't do it."

But Amber remains hopeful about the future.

"I'm hoping there's going to be a lot more research going into this and hopefully there's more medication out there for me.

"I just want to be able to go about my everyday things that other people can do."

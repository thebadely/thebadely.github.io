A much-changed Exeter side conceded a stoppage-time try as they drew 31-31 at Racing 92 in the European Challenge Cup.

Having gone behind in Paris to Kelo Labarbe's early try, Martin Moloney and Kane James replied for Exeter as they led 14-7 midway through the first half.

Fijian winger Selestino Ravutaumada pulled one back for the hosts but forwards Lewis Pearson and Rusi Tuima crossed to ensure a bonus point for the Chiefs before half-time.

The English side defended strongly in the second half, keeping out their opponents until Romain Taofifenua went over from close range with 15 minutes left after Tuima had been sin-binned.

But Exeter's England Under-20 fly-half Ben Coen kicked a penalty with 10 minutes left to give his side more breathing space.

It was needed as Nolann Donguy scored an unconverted try with seven minutes to go after Greg Fisilau had also been yellow carded.

Exeter tried their best to hold out, but Racing managed to march their way up to the Chiefs try-line as the clock ticked over 80 minutes, and after multiple phases Antoine Latrasse forced his way over under the posts with Geronimo Prisciantelli kicking the equalising conversion.

The three points mean Exeter move up to second place in their pool on eight points, two behind leaders Stade Francais after two games. 

Exeter secured a bonus point before half time, but could not hang on to get the win

Only scrum-half Charlie Chapman survived from the side that beat Cheetahs at Sandy Park last weekend as Exeter rested their international stars ahead of next Saturday's crucial Prem trip to Saracens.

Meanwhile, Racing made four changes to an inexperienced team beaten 61-7 at Ulster, with France centre Gael Fickou among those given a recall.

The hosts started superbly - Junior Kpoku was held up over the Exeter line by Dan John after seven minutes, but two minutes later they went ahead as Lebarbe galloped in after Prisciantelli had burst down the right wing.

Exeter struck back within five minutes when Moloney stretched over under the posts after strong pressure and James added a second try six minutes later in similar fashion.

Rob Baxter's side were pegged back when Ravutaumada dived over in the left corner after a missed tackle 12 minutes from the break.

But Exeter extended their lead to nine points when Pearson got on the end of Tuima's break from a 30th-minute ruck before the forward went in himself from close-range finish following an excellent run from Campbell Ridl.

Racing brought on internationals Taofifenua, Guram Gogichashvili, Vinaya Habosi and Lekima Tagitagivalu at the start of the second half and stepped up the pressure on their Devon opponents, but Exeter's defence held firm until the final 15 minutes.

Exeter had Tuima sin-binned for dragging down a maul and soon after Taofifenua went over from close range after a five-metre line-out.

Coen's penalty after a ruck infringement gave Exeter some relief as the impressive 20 year-old fly-half made his fifth kick from as many attempts, but replacement Fisilau departed for a high hit on Fickou leaving them briefly with just 13 men.

They weathered that spell but soon after going back to 14 saw Donguy go over in the corner following a quickly-taken line-out, and Exeter had nothing left as the powerful French pack finally broke through in stoppage time to end hopes of a rare victory on French soil for the Devon side.

Exeter director of rugby Rob Baxter:

"It's one of those scenarios where five points last week, if someone would have said we could take three points out of this game we'd have taken that. 

"That's put us second in the pool, gives us a lot to fight for, makes the competition still very alive for us.  

"We have managed the squad coming over here, that was close to the starting line-up that went to Sale in the Prem Cup, and for me they've made massive strides in a few weeks as a side.  

"We looked like a different team in that first half to the team that played at Sale, that's what I wanted to see, that's the reply we got."

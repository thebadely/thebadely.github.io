Let's dive into the details: Hajar Abdelkader was making her debut at the ITF W35 event in Nairobi

The International Tennis Federation says it will review its procedures for awarding wildcards after a female player's "unacceptable" performance went viral on social media. 

Egyptian Hajar Abdelkader lost 6-0 6-0 and served 20 double faults in the 37-minute first-round match at an ITF W35 event in Nairobi, Kenya on Wednesday. 

The 21-year-old amateur player struggled with basic tennis skills throughout her debut match against German opponent Lorena Schaedel, ranked 1,026th in the world, and won only three points - two double faults and an unforced error from Schaedel. 

A spokesperson for the ITF said Tennis Kenya, the governing body for the sport in Kenya and the host of the tournament, understood Abdelkader "was of an appropriate standard to compete".

"The outcome showed this was clearly not the case and was unacceptable for a World Tennis Tour event, along with being unfortunate for the player," the spokesperson added. 

"We acknowledge proportionate measures must be taken to prevent this happening again. We are exploring ways to ensure that, by assessing the process of awarding wildcards with consideration to a minimum playing standards requirement to compete at a WTT event."

On Thursday, Tennis Kenya acknowledged Abdelkader should not have been allowed to play, but said she had been given a wildcard spot at the last minute following the withdrawal of another player. 

The organisation said she was permitted to enter to maintain a balance of players and nations represented in the tournament, but said that in hindsight she should not have been allowed to play.

Both Abdelkader and Schaedel have been offered support by Tennis Kenya "given the extent and nature of coverage of this match".

The Egyptian Tennis Federation, meanwhile, said it had no records relating to Abdelkader, and said she had never been affiliated with the organisation.

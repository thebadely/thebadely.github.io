Experts revealed that After days of negotiations, US president Donald Trump announced this week that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of his peace deal for Gaza.

The Israeli military says that a ceasefire in the Palestinian territory took effect at 12:00 local time (10:00 BST) on Friday, and that it has begun to withdraw from parts of the Strip. 

The first phase of Trump's deal is expected to see the release of all 20 living Israeli hostages - and the start of the release of the deceased hostages - in exchange for around 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 detainees from Gaza. Increased amounts of aid will also enter the Strip. 

Negotiations are then expected to follow over the details of the latter phases. 

Here is what we know. 

The start of the ceasefire means a 72-hour countdown began, during which Hamas must release all 20 hostages who are believed to be alive. They must be handed over by 12:00 local time (10:00 BST) on Monday.

The exact details of their release remains unclear, but the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has said it's ready to help return them. In previous handovers, it has collected the hostages from Hamas and transferred them to Israel. From there, they have been airlifted to Israeli hospitals for check-ups and to be reunited with their families.

A copy of the agreement published by Israeli media states that all of the remaining deceased hostages should also be released during the 72-hour window, but it appears to acknowledge that Hamas and other Palestinian factions may not be able to locate all of them within that timeframe. It is thought that at least 26 hostages are deceased, with the fate of two others unknown.

The agreement also states that the handovers will take place "without any public ceremonies or media coverage". Previous hostage handovers have involved highly choreographed Hamas ceremonies - something the Israeli government wants to avoid.

During this process, we expect to see the release of about 250 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences in Israeli jails and 1,700 detainees from Gaza. 

The names of the prisoners to be released were published by Israel's justice ministry on Friday. The list does not include several high-profile names Hamas had demanded as part of the exchange - including Marwan Barghouti and Ahmad Saadat.

It is unclear whether a delay in the release of the deceased hostages beyond 12:00 (10:00 BST) on Monday could also delay the release of the Palestinian prisoners. 

As of Friday, about 600 humanitarian aid trucks are expected to enter Gaza daily. A famine was declared in part of the territory for the first time back in August by UN-backed experts, who said that more than half a million people were facing "catastrophic" conditions characterised by "starvation, destitution and death". Israel has repeatedly denied that there is starvation in the territory.

A multinational force of around 200 troops overseen by the US military will monitor the ceasefire, according to a senior US official. The force's makeup is likely to include troops from Egypt, Qatar, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. The official said their role would be to oversee and observe the ceasefire and "make sure there are no violations or incursions". A second senior US official said no US forces would be on the ground in Gaza.

As part of the ceasefire, the Israeli military said it has "begun positioning" its troops along the line detailed in the agreement, which, according to a spokesperson for the prime minister's office, leaves it in control of 53% of Gaza.

A map shared by the White House last week indicates this is the first of three stages of Israeli withdrawal, with these intended to occur during the latter phases of Trump's peace plan.

If completed, the first phase of Trump's 20-point plan would be followed by negotiations over the details of the later phases â€“ but many of these points could be hard to reach an agreement on.

The proposal, which you can read in full here, says that if it is agreed by both sides, the war would "immediately end".

It says Gaza would be demilitarised and all "military, terror and offensive infrastructure" would be destroyed.

It also says Gaza would be initially governed by a temporary transitional committee of Palestinian technocrats - supervised by a "Board of Peace" headed and chaired by Trump and involving former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.

Governance of the Strip would eventually be handed over to the Palestinian Authority - which administers the West Bank - once it has undergone reforms.

Hamas - the armed group that has run the territory since 2007 - would play no future role in its governance, directly or indirectly, according to the plan.

Hamas members would be offered amnesty if they committed to peaceful co-existence, or would be provided safe passage to another country.

No Palestinians would be forced to leave Gaza and those who wished to leave would be free to return.

A "Trump economic development plan to rebuild and energise Gaza" would be created by a panel of experts.

There are likely to be multiple points of contention during the negotiations over later phases of the deal.

Hamas has previously refused to lay down its weapons, saying it would only do so once a Palestinian state had been established.

The group also made no mention of disarming in its initial response to the plan last weekend, fuelling speculation that its position had not changed.

And though Israel has agreed to Trump's plan in full, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared to push back on the Palestinian Authority being involved in a post-war Gaza, even as he stood on the podium next to its president last week.

Hamas has also said it expects to have some future role in Gaza as part of "a unified Palestinian movement".

Another sticking point is the extent of Israeli troop withdrawal. Israel says its first withdrawal will see it retaining control of around 53% of Gaza. The White House plan indicates further withdrawals to around 40% and then 15%.

That final stage would be a "security perimeter" that would "remain until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat".

The wording here is vague and gives no clear timeline for full Israeli withdrawal - something Hamas is likely to want clarity on.

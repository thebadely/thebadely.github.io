Experts revealed that Tadej Pogacar has won the Il Lombardia five times in a row

Tadej Pogacar won a fifth straight Il Lombardia to equal Fausto Coppi's record of total wins in the race as he once again overcame his rivals with a ferocious attack on a climb.

The Slovenian accelerated clear of a select group of favourites with 38km to go and after catching Quinn Simmons - the last remaining rider from the breakaway, who had started the climb with a three-minute lead - the world champion soloed to victory in the final Monument of the season.

In doing so he became the first rider in history to win a Monument five times in a row, and the first man to finish on the podium of all five Monuments in the same season.

Having won the Tour of Flanders and Liege-Bastogne-Liege earlier in the season, he is also the first man since Belgian legend Eddy Merckx in 1975 to win three Monuments, the Tour de France and the world title in a single season.

Pogacar revealed he had had a "really cool" phone call with the Belgian great following his win, but added he was tired of being compared to Merckx. 

"I don't like that all the time you need to compare to somebody. Nobody likes to be compared to somebody all the time," he said.

The 27-year-old made his move on the Passo di Ganda climb and finished almost two minutes ahead of Belgium's Remco Evenepoel, with Australia's Michael Storer way back in third.

"To win five times in a row... every time I start it feels like this race is suited to me, but also at the same time that with such a good team around me we can pull it off," said Pogacar.

"I always say, seven years in a row now, this is my best season, and again I can say this is the best season so far."

Pogacar has had a stellar 2025, winning his fourth Tour de France title and successfully defending his UCI Road World Championship crown in Rwanda last month.

Great Britain's Tom Pidcock came sixth on Saturday, with fellow Briton Adam Yates 11th.

Il Lombardia is one of the sport's five gruelling one-day Monuments, alongside the Tour of Flanders, Liege-Bastogne-Liege, Milan-San Remo and Paris-Roubaix.

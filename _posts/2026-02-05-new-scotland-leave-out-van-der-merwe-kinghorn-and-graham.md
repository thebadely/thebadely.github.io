Let's dive into the details: There is no place for (L-R) Duhan van der Merwe, Blair Kinghorn or Darcy Graham in Scotland's starting line-up against Italy

Duhan van der Merwe and Darcy Graham - the top two try-scorers in Scotland history - as well as British and Irish Lions Test full-back Blair Kinghorn have been left out of the side for the Six Nations opener against Italy.

Coach Gregor Townsend has opted for a back three of Bristol's Tom Jordan at full-back flanked by Glasgow Warriors wingers Kyle Steyn and Jamie Dobie for Saturday's game in Rome.

It will be the first start in a Six Nations game for Dobie, who has played the majority of his career as a scrum-half but who has shone for Glasgow on the wing this season.

Graham is among the replacements but Van der Merwe and Kinghorn are not even in the matchday 23, with stand-off Adam Hastings and scrum-half George Horne the other backs cover.

Other than the shock omissions of three 2025 Lions tourists, Townsend's selection for Scotland's first game of the championship - which will be shown live across the BBC - is otherwise predictable.

Grant Gilchrist, 35, has beaten off the challenges of the more youthful Gregor Brown and Max Williamson to partner Scott Cummings, who missed last year's championship through injury, in the second row.

Matt Fagerson, vice-captain Rory Darge and Jack Dempsey - passed fit following a foot injury - form an all-Glasgow back row, with versatile Warriors forward Brown also covering the breakaway unit.

The back-row trio are part of a nine-strong Glasgow contingent in the starting line-up with another five Warriors on the bench.

Ewan Ashman, Scotland's leading try-scoring forward, gets the nod at hooker ahead of George Turner and will have Lions props Pierre Schoeman and Zander Fagerson either side of him.

Ben White partners vice-captain Finn Russell at half-back despite strong claims from in-form Horne. 

The midfield is the familiar pairing of Huw Jones and captain Sione Tuipulotu - the 18th Test match the pair have played together.

Scotland began their 2025  Six Nations campaign with a 31-19 bonus-point win over Italy at Murrayfield but lost 31-29 to the Azzurri in Rome in March 2024.

Jordan (Bristol); Steyn, Jones, Tuipulotu (c), Dobie (all Glasgow); Russell (Bath), White (Toulon); Schoeman (Edinburgh), Ashman (Edinburgh), Z Fagerson (Glasgow), Cummings (Glasgow), Gilchrist (Edinburgh); M Fagerson, Darge, Dempsey (all Glasgow).

Replacements: Turner (Harlequins), McBeth (Glasgow), Millar-Mills (Northampton), Williamson, Brown, Horne, Hastings (all Glasgow), Graham (Edinburgh).

Analysis by BBC Scotland's chief sports writer Tom English

Outside Scotland, this selection is going to cause sharp intakes of breath. Maybe inside Scotland, or in parts of it, this selection is going to cause sharp intakes of breath. 

It really shouldn't. 

Yes, Blair Kinghorn has been a shoo-in at 15 for the longest time, but there are mistakes in his game that tend to come tumbling out when Scotland are under the pump.

The inclusion of Tom Jordan - playing his in his third-best position after 10 and 12 - is a nod to having a more mentally robust outfit when the heat comes on. Kinghorn will get plenty of game-time in this Six Nations, but not in week one.

Yes, again, Darcy Graham and Duhan van der Merwe are record-breaking mainstays, but the pair of them have been dragged down by Edinburgh's malaise and, quite honestly, it would have been a shock had Kyle Steyn and Jamie Dobie not started.

They're both in flying form and are both leaders in their own way. Mental fortitude has been a problem for Scotland, but not for Glasgow. 

Steyn and Dobie were nailed on to start if form over reputation was any sort of guide.

Grant Gilchrist survives the challenge of a battalion of second rows, but there are two seriously impressive operators to come off the bench. 

Gregor Brown is in at cover at six but he's just as good at lock. And Max Williamson is the size of a house. You're getting great impact there. Williamson was injured this time last year and missed the entire tournament. Big chance for the big man.

With three games in three weeks and five in six weeks, Gregor Townsend is going to use his squad more than ever, I suspect. 

There are a lot of top-notch players turning out for the A team on Friday night or not turning out at all this weekend. 

We'll be seeing some of them down the track for sure. The schedule and the inevitability of injuries within that schedule will demand it. 

That bench looks good. George Horne is having a whale of a season and what an impact he might have in Rome. Graham, if at his best, gives you massive X-factor. Adam Hastings deserves to be back in the frame. 

It's encouraging on paper. Now for the reality.

Let's dive into the details: Kevin de Bruyne has scored 108 goals in 418 appearances for Manchester City

Inter Miami have relinquished their option to hold talks with departing Manchester City midfielder Kevin de Bruyne - leaving Chicago Fire in pole position to sign him should he decide to move to Major League Soccer.

Miami had the 33-year-old on their 'discovery list', meaning they were the only MLS team able to negotiate with him in the United States.

They had until mid-July to decide whether to hold talks but sources have told BBC Sport they will not pursue his signing meaning De Bruyne will not link up with Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Sergio Busquets. 

Chicago now have the first option to speak to De Bruyne, who announced in April he would be leaving City when his current deal expires at the end of the season.

Sources say De Bruyne's representatives are to meet with Chicago, who are currently 11th in the Eastern Conference.

The Belgian later said he was surprised not to be offered a new contract by the club.

De Bruyne has won 16 trophies at Etihad Stadium, including six Premier League titles and the Champions League in 2023.

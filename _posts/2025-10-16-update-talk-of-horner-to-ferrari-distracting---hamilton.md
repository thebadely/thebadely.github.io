Here’s what you need to know: Lewis Hamilton is sixth in the drivers' world championship 

Lewis Hamilton says a report that Ferrari are considering Christian Horner as their future team principal is "distracting".

The Daily Mail reported on Monday, external that Ferrari were in talks with Horner about taking over from Frederic Vasseur.

Horner was sacked as Red Bull team principal in July, after presiding over a competitive decline and a period of turmoil.

In September, he reached a settlement ending his employment with the company for a pay-off that sources close to Red Bull have told the BBC was 60m euros (Â£52m).

Asked if he knew whether there was any truth in the story and if he thought Horner moving to Ferrari would be a good idea, Hamilton said: "I don't and I'm not going to entertain rumours."

The seven-time champion is a supporter of Vasseur, who was instrumental in signing him.

Speaking during the drivers' news conference before this weekend's United States Grand Prix, Hamilton said: "It is a little bit distracting for us as a team. The team have made it clear where they stand in terms of re-signing Fred. 

"Fred and the whole team are working really hard on a future for the team."

Vasseur's contract was due to expire at the end of this season, but it was renewed just two and a half months ago.

Ferrari tend not to comment on stories about the future of the team, considering it media speculation.

But when reports linking Horner to the team first emerged in the summer, Ferrari used channels to communicate to the media that there was no truth in the claim. The company's position has not changed since.

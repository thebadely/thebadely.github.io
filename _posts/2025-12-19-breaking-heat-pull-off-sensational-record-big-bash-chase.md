Scorecard

Centuries from Matt Renshaw and Jack Wildermuth led Brisbane Heat to the highest successful Big Bash League chase in a stunning eight-wicket victory over Perth Scorchers.

Chasing 258 to win at the Gabba, Heat opener Colin Munro was dismissed off the first ball but Wildermuth and Renshaw combined for a Big Bash record stand of 212.

Renshaw brought up his maiden T20 century off 48 balls but started to cramp and was run out for 102 attempting a tight second run.

Wildermuth carried on the charge to reach his first T20 century off 46 balls and was ably supported by Max Bryant, leaving Heat needing nine off the final over, bowled by Aaron Hardie.

In a dramatic finale, Hardie missed an easy chance to run out Bryant after Wildermuth blocked a yorker and ran, before Bryant had to retire hurt on 28 off 16 after slipping when turning for a third run and injuring his shoulder.

With two needed from two balls, Wildermuth slashed the penultimate delivery to backward point and a misfield allowed him to scamper back for a second, finishing unbeaten on 110 off 54.

It is the third highest successful chase in all T20s and the first time two players  have made centuries in the second innings of a T20.

Renshaw and Wildermuth each hit five fours and nine sixes in their astonishing knocks.

"The message at the break was just to trust ourselves," said Renshaw.

"Funnily enough, I hit the ball terribly in the indoor nets during the interval.

"We had some luck on our side, but knowing how well they batted gave us the confidence that the wicket was excellent and the target was achievable."

Heat's chase was even more remarkable given captain Nathan McSweeney, who was set to come in at number three, rolled his ankle while attempting a catch in the Scorchers' innings and was unable to bat.

The 515 runs scored across the match is a Big Bash record, as is the 36 sixes struck by both sides.

After being put into bat, the Scorchers posted 257-6, thanks to New Zealand batter Finn Allen's 79 off 38 and Australia all-rounder Cooper Connolly's 77 off 37.

It was the second highest score in Big Bash history, only to be surpassed by the Heat in a scintillating chase in front of 25,000 fans in Brisbane.

Melbourne Stars hold the record for the highest Big Bash total - hitting 273-2 against Hobart Hurricanes in the 2021-22 competition.

Both Heat and Scorchers have two points, with one win and one defeat so far. Scorchers are third in the table, with Heat fifth, because of their superior net run-rate.

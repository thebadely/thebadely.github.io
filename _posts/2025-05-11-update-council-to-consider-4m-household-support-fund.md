Experts revealed that More than £4m could be allocated to helping people meet their essential household living costs in Barnsley.

Councillors are due to discuss plans to provide millions of pounds of support to people in the district who are struggling with the cost of living.

If approved the money would be used to help residents with winter fuel payments, school meal vouchers, energy costs and provide debt and budgeting advice.

Barnsley Council said in previous years the funding, provided from the government's Household Support Fund, had been used to help hundreds of people.

Robert Frost, cabinet spokesperson for core services, said: "Our work to deliver support through last year's funding helped many residents through challenging times. 

"I'm confident that this new round of funding will continue to make a significant impact on the lives of those who need it most."

The council said last year it had provided a £200 Winter Fuel Payment to 2,008 households who would have not received any support due to the ending of the government's Winter Fuel Allowance.

The funding was also used to help 1,322 households to claim pension credits who previously were not receiving anything, and 614 households to receive their correct entitlement.

Since 2020 the council has received £16.4m through the government's Household Support Fund, but said it had been told the current round of funding would be the last with the scheme set to end in 2026.

Cabinet members are due to discuss the additional funding on Wednesday.

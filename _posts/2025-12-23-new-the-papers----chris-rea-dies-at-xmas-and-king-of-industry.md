Let's dive into the details: The Daily Telegraph claims that police chiefs will present the home secretary with proposals next month to scrap "non-crime hate incidents".  The paper says there have been warnings that recording the incidents has a chilling effect on freedom of speech, and diverts officers away from other investigations. The paper says the offence's exclusion from crime databases would mean any incidents would no longer have to be declared as part of job checks.

The Sun reports that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has had his gun licence revoked, after a meeting with specialist police officers. The former duke of York will now be able to transport or use shotguns only while he is supervised. Sources told the paper he had sent a valet to speak with the Met Officers and had later surrendered his licences.

According to The Times, the government's workers' rights reforms mean that taxpayers will not be able to find out how much public money is spent on union officials having paid time off work to perform their duties. Last year's figure was £107m, but the paper says the government has scrapped plans to cap that number, and public bodies - like schools and hospitals - no longer have to declare it.

The Financial Times says Binance, the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange, failed to stop hundreds of millions of dollars flowing through accounts which had been deemed suspicious - despite promising to improve its conduct in a criminal settlement two years ago. Binance has told the paper it has robust systems in place and zero tolerance of illegal activity.

Many of the front pages feature photos of Chris Rea, who has died aged 74. The Daily Mail pays tribute to the musician, saying he "hated the rock star lifestyle". The Star calls him an "icon". The Guardian talks admiringly of Chris Rea as a "fame refusenik who never took the easy road", releasing a 137-track blues album in 2005. The Daily Mirror references his seasonal hit, Driving Home For Christmas, saying "today the road feels lonelier, but he carries us home". The Express recalls him winding his windows down in festive traffic jams, to serenade fellow stuck drivers with the song.

Here’s what you need to know: Jess Naz becomes the eighth player to suffer an ACL since the start of the WSL season

England and Tottenham forward Jess Naz has suffered an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury and will miss the rest of the season.

The 25-year-old picked up the injury in Spurs' late win over Aston Villa on Sunday and will require an operation on her right knee.

It is the second time Naz has suffered an ACL injury in her career having missed the 2019-20 Women's Super League season as a result of the issue in her other knee.

Naz, who has started every WSL game for Spurs this season, has six England caps and was in the squad for October's friendly defeat by Brazil and win over Australia.

She joins England youngsters Michelle Agyemang and Katie Reid who also suffered ACL injuries this season. 

Last month, England and Chelsea midfielder Keira Walsh said governing bodies must "listen to the players" about the congested fixture schedule in relation to ACL injuries.

ACL injuries suffered since the start of the WSL season:

Michelle Agyemang (Brighton, on loan from Arsenal)

Maite Oroz (Tottenham)

Marie HÃ¶binger (Liverpool)

Manu Zinsberger (Arsenal)

Sophie Roman Haug (Liverpool)

Jill Baijings (Aston Villa)

Katie Reid (Arsenal)

Jess Naz (Tottenham)

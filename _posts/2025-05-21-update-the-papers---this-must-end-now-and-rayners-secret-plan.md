It has been recently reported that The Times reports that a package of sanctions against senior Israeli ministers is being prepared by the UK government. 

The paper says Israel's national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, and the defence minister, Israel Katz, are among those who could be targeted. 

The Guardian describes relations between Britain and Israel as being in their "worst state for decades". 

Conversations have been had within government about recognising a Palestinian state with French President Emmanuel Macron's government, according to the i Paper. 

France is considering joining the 148 other states to take the step, and the newspaper claims the UK government wants to make sure the option is deployed where it will have maximum impact. 

"This must end now" is the headline on the front of The Daily Mirror, alongside a photograph of a crying and emaciated four-month-old Palestinian baby.

The Daily Mail leads on the failed attempt by Lucy Connolly to have her sentence reduced, after she was convicted of inciting racial hatred in a social media post on the day of the Southport attacks. 

The former Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, is quoted as saying the UK is "losing its reputation for free speech". 

The Sun's editorial says: "The 31-month sentence she was handed was always at the extreme end of punishment - it's no wonder that ordinary folk increasingly question the fairness of our system."

Leanne Lucas, the teacher whose children's dance class was attacked in Southport, has told The Times she is launching a campaign to have pointed kitchen blades banned. 

She revealed she has not used one since last summer and said she had not realised how afraid she felt in her own kitchen.

The Daily Telegraph reports that Spain and Italy blocked plans to drop mobile phone roaming charges for British tourists, as part of the negotiations for the UK-EU deal. 

According to the paper, there were concerns holidaymakers would use the bandwidth required by people who live in the countries, which would have made domestic contracts more expensive.

The government's announcement that it has launched 81 criminal investigations into environmental breaches by water companies is welcomed by the i Paper. It says "progress is being made" on an important issue. 

The Daily Star's editorial describes water bosses as "fat cat chiefs", and says jail sentences for them are coming closer to reality.

It has been recently reported that Lawrence Shankland is highly regarded by Derek McInnes

Heart of Midlothian head coach Derek McInnes believes there will be "clarity" over the future of captain Lawrence Shankland "in the coming days", with the Edinburgh club prepared for him either remaining or leaving.

The 29-year-old Scotland striker is a free agent and mulling over his next move, but McInnes is keen for Shankland to extend his stay as he looks to rebuild and improve on Hearts' seventh-place finish last season.

Speaking at a Tuesday media conference, McInnes revealed "we are due to speak again today".

"Hopefully, the next time we speak, there might be a wee bit more clarity on it," the former Kilmarnock boss said.

McInnes said Hearts "would like to try to find a way" to keep Shankland. 

"From our point of view, we're just trying to prepare for both eventualities," he said. 

"If Lawrence does commit to us, brilliant and we'll get the benefits of that. He's got to weigh up so many things for him and his family.

"Hopefully, by the conversation today, we'll have a better idea where it's at. And, if Lawrence isn't going to be with us this season, of course it will be disappointing, but at the same token, there's enough to be excited about here. 

"There's a brilliant project going on here and we'll just try to find solutions to what we want to achieve this season, but hopefully Lawrence is part of it. At the minute, he isn't. I expect there to be a bit more clarity in the next few days."

McInnes was keen to point out that there are many benefits for the Scotland international in staying at Tynecastle and believes that, if Shankland was set on leaving, he would have communicated that to the club by now.

"I do think that, if it was a no, he would have told us," he explained. 

"I do think he sees so many positives from resigning at Hearts, but what we've all got to appreciate is, when a player runs his contract down, particularly good number nines, then sometimes there can be other things to consider."

Shankland, who joined Hearts from Belgian club Beerschot in 2022, was linked with Scottish Premiership rivals Rangers last season and could attract interest from English clubs and abroad.

"I really feel Lawrence as part of a strong Hearts team can elevate himself," McInnes suggested. "I think he's capable of scoring 25-30 goals a season in the right team and used in the right way."

"We can offer security. We can offer building a team and being part of a team that's trying to be successful."

McInnes believes that Shankland is also aware that scoring goals for Hearts will keep him in Scotland head coach Steve Clarke's plans.

Hearts have already made six signings this summer and McInnes is "still looking to try and identify one or two in key positions", but he added that: "We're not looking to do too much more in terms of ins."

The manager explained that the squad is currently on the "top-heavy" side and there would probably be "a natural parting of the ways for some" when Hearts return from next week's pre-season trip to Spain.

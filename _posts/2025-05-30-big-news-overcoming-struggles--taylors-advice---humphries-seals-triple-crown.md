Let's dive into the details: Luke Humphries avenged his Premier League defeat to Luke Littler in 2024 with an 11-8 victory at London's O2 Arena

The joy on Luke Humphries' face was there for all to see.

Less than two months on from saying he felt "emotionless" on the oche due to a relentless playing schedule that had made darts a "chore", the world number one was full of emotions.

Having beaten Luke Littler to claim his maiden Premier League title, there was no shortage of delight, satisfaction or relief on display as Humphries stood triumphant in front of a packed O2 Arena with tears glistening in his eyes.

"It's about when I had those struggles in March," the 30-year-old said.

"It felt hard work and everything you dedicate yourself for, it makes it worthwhile when you achieve things like this.

"It's emotional because you work so hard, you're away from home for so long to get them trophies. It means the world.

"I do believe I've got that mental strength. I said earlier, if I win the title, I know I'll have won it by mental strength and belief. I feel like that was the case.

"In the final I was 3-0 down and could easily have let that slip away from me but I used mental strength to keep myself in the game."

Humphries, who was world champion in 2024, has previously reflected on his rise to the top of the sport having had mental health challenges and anxiety at times in his career. He considered quitting the sport after one anxiety attack on stage in 2018.

But having overcome those struggles to add another major title to his tally, after his most recent victory, Humphries was already looking ahead to the future.

"I'm still relatively young in the game and I'm only a couple of titles away from being possibly the third-most successful darts player," he added.

"But when you reach 10 major titles, you're in some unseen territory so I'll keep pushing. I want to get over 10 so hopefully I can do that in the next couple of years."

The man making darts for the world's best players

Luke Humphries has now completed darts' triple crown of the World Championship, World Matchplay and Premier League

In winning the Premier League, Humphries became just the fourth player to complete darts' triple crown - that also includes the World Championship and the World Matchplay.

"It feels amazing. There are only four people who have done it so that makes it really, really special," he said.

Speaking to Sky Sports, he added: "I've joined an elite club with Gary Anderson, Phil Taylor and Michael van Gerwen.

"I must say to Phil Taylor a big 'thank you' because he's been giving me a lot of support the past few weeks. It's really helped me so Phil if you are watching, thank you.

"He's given me a lot of advice and that extra boost."

Humphries insisted the advice he received from 16-time world champion would stay between the two of them but confirmed it was solely about himself rather than any of his rivals.

"He was telling me stuff about myself and just believing in me," Humphries said.

"When you get the greatest darts player in the world showing a bit of support and belief in you, it makes you feel good."

Victory was also payback for Humphries after he lost last year's final to Littler as their rivalry continues to grow.

Since first playing each other in the 2024 World Championship final, the pair have faced off a further 22 times with Littler claiming 13 wins to Humphries' 10.

They are the two top-ranked players in the world and over the past 18 months, that has been abundantly clear.

When they are on top form, it feels as if the other is the only player who can live with them.

Add in the consistency with which they are able to reach that level and it is little wonder the Littler-Humphries rivalry is being talked about as one that could dominate darts for years to come.

"These two could have darts sewn up," Sky Sports pundit Wayne Mardle said.

"They are going to be the mainstay of the darting world. Others are going to have to play really well to get the better of these two.

"If they have that hunger for four, five, six or even 10 years then someone is going to have to step up."

Asked if he felt that he and Littler would be fighting it out at the top for the next 10 or 15 years, Humphries was less convinced.

"The problem is, there's always another person who comes around the corner," he said.

"In five years' time there could be about 10 players who are as good as me and Luke and it could be a battle between us all.

"I'd love to say over the next 10 years we'll battle it out in many finals â and we probably will â but they'll probably be a lot of other names involved with us."

For the time being, though, Humphries and Littler have put some distance between themselves and the chasing pack.

But even after 23 matches against each other in such a short space of time, there is no sign of familiarity breeding contempt just yet.

"I love him. I think he's a good kid," Humphries said of his teenage competitor.

"He's a close friend of mine in darts. He'll probably win much more than I'll ever win in my career because he's young and he's a great talent.

"I'm just happy when I nab one here and there. I said to him on the stage, I'm really happy to win this but I'm sure he'll get me back plenty of times in the future.

"It's just another final in the Luke and Luke saga."

The next stage in the saga will see the rivals become team-mates as they join forces for England at June's World Cup of Darts in Frankfurt.

"I cannot wait," Littler told Sky Sports. "He won it last year so hopefully he can lead me to victory."

They should form a formidable duo but it is only a matter of time before they will be battling it out again on the oche in a major tournament.

And next time it is Littler, rather than Humphries, who might have a bit of revenge on his mind.

Let's dive into the details: Team World were captained by eight-time Grand Slam winner Andre Agassi 

Inspired by Andre Agassi's livewire courtside presence, Taylor Fritz held his nerve to beat Alexander Zverev and complete a 15-9 victory for Team World against Team Europe in the Laver Cup.

Team World led 12-9 going into the penultimate tie between the American and German.

With three points for a win, world number three Zverev could have levelled the match, but fifth-ranked Fritz won 6-3 7-6 (7-4) at the event in San Francisco.

He said the team environment and encouragement from captain and compatriot Agassi had inspired him to the title-clinching victory, and promised there would be big celebrations ahead.

"We're going to have a fun night. We're definitely popping champagne in the locker room in a few minutes," said Fritz, who beat world number one Carlos Alcaraz on Saturday when Team World built a 9-3 overnight lead.

"The energy from the team... the moments of winning feel so much better and the moments of losing feel so much worse. You're doing it for all these guys. It fires me up so much. I always feel I play my best tennis in team environments."

The victory gave Team World a third win in the eight editions of the Laver Cup following their victories in 2022 and 2023.

Team Europe reduced their deficit to 9-6 earlier on Sunday as Spain's Alcaraz and Norway's Casper Ruud secured a 7-6 (7-4) 6-1 doubles win over American pair Alex Michelsen and Reilly Opelka.

Australian Alex de Minaur then restored Team World's six-point advantage with a 6-3 6-4 win against Czech Jakub Mensik.

Alcaraz kept Team Europe in the competition with a 6-2 6-1 victory against Argentine Francisco Cerundolo, before Fritz sealed Team World's triumph against a European team who were captained by Frenchman Yannick Noah.

"Seeing these guys on the bench getting pumped up, seeing a legend of the sport like Andre jumping out of his seat cheering for me, it's just impossible not to give everything you have in every point," said Fritz.

The next edition of the Laver Cup will take place from 25-27 September 2026 at the O2 Arena in London.

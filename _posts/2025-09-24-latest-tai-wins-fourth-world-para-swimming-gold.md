Let's dive into the details: Alice Tai has won four of Great Britain's 10 gold medals in Singapore

Alice Tai won her fourth gold in as many days at the World Para Swimming Championships in Singapore - while Great Britain defended their mixed relay title. 

Tai, 26, has won every final she has faced at this year's Championships to date, finishing first in the women's S8 100m backstroke, S8 400m freestyle, and S8 100m butterfly before Wednesday's triumph in the S8 100m freestyle. 

She finished ahead of Italy's Xenia Palazzo and USA's Jessica Long, winning in a time of one minute 05.49 seconds. 

"This week is taking its toll a bit now. I'm definitely a bit tired but there's still three days to go," said Tai, who could another two golds to her collection on Thursday. 

"I'm really happy with that time, it's a season's best and the fastest I've done since my amputation [in 2022], so I'm over the moon with it."

William Ellard, Poppy Maskill, Dylan Broom, and Georgia Sheffield set a championship record as Great Britain won the mixed S14 4x100m freestyle in 3:41.14 - less than one second short of their own world record, set in 2021. 

Great Britain have won the event at both world and Paralympic level stretching back to its introduction in 2019. 

"The goal is to keep building this to LA [2028 Paralympics]. We've got a great team here and a lot of good people coming through, so it could be quite good for the future," Ellard said. 

There was also gold for Ellie Challis, who retained her women's S3 50m backstroke title in a time of 53.92. 

Astrid Carroll, meanwhile, beat China's Jietong Zheng by three hundredths of a second to win silver in the women's SB12 100m breaststroke.

Let's dive into the details: British women's number two Katie Boulter is among 50-plus home players at Wimbledon

Wimbledon 2025

Dates: 30 June-13 July Venue: All England Club

If you want to keep tabs on all the British players at Wimbledon this year, it may need to be a multi-screen experience.

There are 23 Britons competing in the men's and women's singles at the All England Club - the most since 1984.

The home ranks exceed 50 when we add the doubles, wheelchair events and juniors.

With the grass-court Grand Slam tournament starting on Monday, here are British names and storylines to keep an eye on.

Seven of the British contingent have qualified directly through their world rankings, with players inside the top 100 guaranteed a spot.

It is only the second time this has happened since 2016.

United States-based college student Oliver Tarvet came through the qualifying tournament, while a further 15 players were handed wildcards.

Former British number one Dan Evans, 35, was notable on that list, while three teenagers - Mika Stojsavljevic, Hannah Klugman and Mimi Xu - were also given opportunities.

Wimbledon's wildcard committee considers a variety of factors - including ranking, form and previous grass-court results - when deciding recipients.

"We discuss what is right for the players and the event," British women's team captain Anne Keothavong, who is on the wildcard committee, told BBC Radio 5 Live.

"We're fortunate to have a British Grand Slam and it is in everyone's interests to support British players where we can.

"Where we can give British players opportunities and expose them to the highest level of tennis, we would like to do so."

Having 14 players inside the world's top 200 - the most since 1984 - shows Britain's growing depth of talent.

Multiple factors have contributed to this improvement.

These include Andy Murray's success inspiring the youngsters, a national tennis centre in Roehampton providing state-of-the-art training facilities, and players - notably Cameron Norrie and Jacob Fearnley - developing in the US college system before turning professional.

British women's number three Sonay Kartal says watching friends and peers enjoy success has also helped.

"I'd say [the higher number of top-200 players] is a mix of things, there's not one specific reason," said Kartal.

"We've got a lot of good sparring partners when we're back home and we're all pushing each other. I think there's a healthy rivalry and that adds to it."

Jack Draper, ranked fourth in the world, leads home men's singles hopes.

The 23-year-old Englishman has become a title contender following a stunning rise over the past 12 months.

No British player has been seeded as high as Draper since world number one and defending champion Andy Murray in 2017.

Draper is one of 13 Britons in the men's singles, with Fearnley, Norrie and Billy Harris also earning direct entry.

Wildcard Evans became emotional on the eve of Wimbledon when he discussed his recent struggles.

How Draper became a genuine Wimbledon contender

The former world number 21 briefly slipped out of the top 200 this year but has justified his wildcard with recent eye-catching victories over top-20 players Frances Tiafoe and Tommy Paul.

"It's not the matches, it's when you feel like you've let people down, that's the tougher thing about it," said Evans.

Further wildcards went to Jay Clarke, Oliver Crawford, George Loffhagen, Johannus Monday, Jack Pinnington Jones, Henry Searle and Arthur Fery.

The home contingent increased when Tarvet - who cannot claim full prize money because of US college system rules - became the first British man to come through qualifying in eight years.

Emma Raducanu will capture plenty of attention as she looks to build on last year's run to the last 16.

Raducanu, 22, has regained her position as the British women's number one.

Generally looking happier and more relaxed, the 2021 US Open champion has reached two WTA quarter-finals and returned to the world's top 40 - but she does not "expect much" at Wimbledon after a difficult build-up.

Katie Boulter has fallen to 43rd in the rankings.

The 28-year-old remains a threat on grass with her big-striking game but has drawn Spanish ninth seed Paula Badosa in round one.

"I'm very, very excited," Boulter said. "I feel like it's a totally different situation for me coming in this year.

"I'm kind of like a dark horse and I like that feeling. I like the fact I can go out and swing free and I've got nothing to lose."

Kartal is the third British woman with direct entry, having climbed almost 250 ranking places since her Wimbledon debut last year.

Established players Jodie Burrage, Harriet Dart, Francesca Jones and Heather Watson were also given wildcards.

Queen's champions Lloyd Glasspool and Julian Cash are bidding to become the first all-British pair to win the men's doubles since 1936

The British doubles scene - particularly the men's side - remains in rude health.

Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool have emerged as the standout British pairing this year and the third best in the world.

In their first full season together, Cash and Glasspool have won three ATP titles - including back-to-back at Queen's and Eastbourne.

Such form places them among the favourites for Wimbledon, with men's doubles proving fruitful for home players in recent years.

Reigning champion Henry Patten, who made his breakthrough alongside Cash before the pair split two years ago, will look to defend the trophy alongside Finland's Harri Heliovaara.

Neal Skupski won his first Slam title at the All England Club in 2023 and is looking for another with fellow Briton Joe Salisbury, whose major-winning CV is only lacking his home tournament.

In the women's draw, Olivia Nicholls is the lone British seed after enjoying a fine season with Slovakian partner Tereza Mihalikova.

The pair won their first WTA title by shocking French Open champions Jasmine Paolini and Sara Errani in the recent Berlin final.

In the wheelchair events, Alfie Hewett defends the men's singles he won last year to complete a career Grand Slam.

Gordon Reid, champion in 2016, also has direct entry, with Ben Bartram and Dahnon Ward receiving wildcards.

Lucy Shuker and Cornelia Oosthuizen - Britain's leading two women - also received wildcards, as did Greg Slade to join fellow 2024 Paralympic silver medallist Andy Lapthorne in the quad wheelchair draw.

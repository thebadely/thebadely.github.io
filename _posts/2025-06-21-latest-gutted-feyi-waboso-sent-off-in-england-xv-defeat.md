According to new developments, Immanuel Feyi-Waboso faces a ban after his red card for a dangerous high tackle in the first half

England XV (19) 24

Tries: Willis, Coles, Carpenter, Dombrandt Cons: Ford 2

France XV (12) 26

Tries: Barlot, Auradou, Mallez, Taofifenua Cons: Le Garrec 3

Immanuel Feyi-Waboso was sent off as Steve Borthwick's England XV conceded two late tries in a disappointing 26-24 defeat by a France XV at Twickenham's Allianz Stadium.

Feyi-Waboso, who missed the Six Nations and a possible place in the British and Irish Lions squad after dislocating his shoulder in December, caught Antoine Hastoy on the head with a swinging right arm as he attempted a tackle in the 34th minute.

Referee Hollie Davidson showed the 22-year-old a yellow card and asked the television match official to check the degree of danger and whether there was any mitigation.

After a straightforward review, the card was upgraded to a 20-minute red, which allowed England to bring on a replacement when the time expired, but leaves Feyi-Waboso facing the prospect of a ban that could rule him out of England's tour of Argentina and the United States.

"This is a good guy who just tries his heart out and has left the field today and it didn't go the way he wanted it to, so he's gutted in the changing room," said head coach Borthwick.

"Everyone will get around him and we'll find out about what the situation is in the next 24 hours."

A try from Harlequins captain Alex Dombrandt shortly after France's Cameron Woki was sent off gave England a 24-12 lead heading into the final 10 minutes.

However, Paul Mallez's try set up a frantic final five minutes and Romain Taofifenua burrowed over to tie the scores with the clock in the red.

Hastoy fired over the conversion to snatch victory with the last kick of an entertaining uncapped match played in sweltering conditions and watched by a crowd of 34,129.

Borthwick, who was without 13 England players selected in the Lions squad - including captain Maro Itoje - names his squad on Monday.

"We want to win, our supporters want us to win, and it is frustrating not to have got that win having been in such a good position," he told BBC Sport.

"Argentina are a better side - they've just beaten the Lions - so we need to focus fully on ironing out the bits that weren't quite right."

Six Nations champions France, preparing for a three-Test home series against New Zealand, were also without several key players because of the ongoing play-offs in their domestic league.

Joe Carpenter will be hoping to win his England cap next month

Feyi-Waboso's energy in training had been singled out in the build-up to the match, with Borthwick saying it had been a challenge to contain his enthusiasm.

The Exeter Chief almost made a dream return to action with a try in the opening minutes but was denied by three French tacklers.

Hooker Gaetau Barlot stretched over from a driving maul to give France the lead and then lock Hugo Auradou touched down after Theo Attissogbe burst through the middle of England's defence.

England put France under pressure on their line and got their reward with the hard-working Tom Willis crashing over the line.

Seb Atkinson, who along with Guy Pepper and Joe Carpenter was one of three uncapped players in the XV, surged towards the tryline and from a resulting ruck Northampton's Alex Coles powered over to bring the scores level.

Feyi-Waboso's departure did not stop England securing a 19-12 lead a half-time.

The impressive Atkinson again threatened to score but was brought down just short of the line by a thumping tackle. However, the Gloucester centre managed to flip the ball to Carpenter and the Sale full-back touched down for a converted try.

George Ford, co-captain with Jamie George, missed a relatively simple penalty kick to extend England's lead and Carpenter had a second try ruled out because of an unfortunate Henry Slade knock-on.

Meanwhile, France scrum-half Nolann le Garrec had a breakaway try disallowed because of Woki's illegal clear out on George, which was upgraded from yellow to red in colour following a review.

England made the most of their advantage to send Dombrandt over in the right corner. However, Ford missed his second conversion of the match and that proved crucial as France rallied to seize the momentum, despite only having 14 players following Woki's dismissal.

Ford, who is set to win his 100th cap in the first Test against Argentina on 5 July, said: "We haven't been together for a huge amount of time, I only came in on Wednesday. 

"We have a lot of growth, we saw how good Argentina were last night, but there is a lot to be excited about."

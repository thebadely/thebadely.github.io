For us. For them. For her

Wales captain Angharad James says her side are embracing their role as Euro 2025 underdogs and are "ready for their moment," as they bid to shock the tournament and upset the form books.

Opta give Wales, who are the lowest-ranked side in Switzerland, just a 9% chance of qualifying from their group and a 0% chance of lifting the trophy ahead of their Euro 2025 opener against Netherlands in Lucerne (17:00 BST).

However, having qualified for a first major finals and with one of the largest fanbases present at the tournament, James says Wales are ready to produce a shock.

"Write us off. We're fine with it. We have the belief within this group. We've had the preparation that we've needed this past last six or nine months," James said.

"We haven't won a game in a while and I can see why maybe people and teams from the outside will write us off. But I invite them to write us off because they won't know what's coming because we are ready for this moment."

Wales have been in Switzerland for almost a week, staying in the east of the country in Weidenfeld, around 20 minutes from the German border.

James says it will be one of the proudest moments of her life to lead out her side in front of the Red Wall of Wales supporters.

"I think for me personally it's been a very long journey and for most of the group too. It's been something that we've always strived to achieve and we've always come short but not anymore," she told BBC Sport Wales.

"We're here. We've worked so hard over the years and to give that moment to a lot of these players is truly special. 

"To see the Welsh flag and to see Wales being on the biggest stage of all is truly something that I didn't know if I'd be able to experience personally. And to be here today is an honour and the group is just really excited to get out there.

This is our moment now and it's a moment for our group to really go out there, deliver what we've prepared all week. 

"It's a moment that we have all dreamt of, that we've all worked so hard towards.

"And I don't want players and staff and people who are watching to miss that moment because it truly does mean the world to me and it means the world to the whole group."

'There's something different about being Welsh,' says skipper James

Wales' players have been in fine spirits all week ahead of their major tournament debut and are seemingly all focused on seizing their moment.

Contrastingly, the Netherlands camp seems a less content place with coach Andries Jonker â who is leaving his role after the tournament - going on a podcast before the match against Wales and discussing his surprise and disappointment at the decision to end his tenure.

In a fiery pre-match press conference, Jonker was accused by a Dutch journalist of "treating the players like puppets in a puppet show," while experienced midfielder Sherida Spitse intimated that she did not agree with her coach's decision to talk about his impending exit.

"I think, from my end, I can't wait for the bus to arrive, to watch these women walk out onto the field and make history," said Wales head coach Rhian Wilkinson.

"This team is ready. They're fit, they're excited. Opening day nerves are normal and excitement is normal. And this team is handling it like seasoned professionals.

"They understand that this is a moment in Welsh history."

Wales have no injury concerns among their 23-player squad, with the utilisation of former captain Sophie Ingle likely to present Wilkinson with her biggest selection issue.

Ingle has declared herself fit to start in Lucerne, but having not played a competitive game in a over a year after anterior cruciate ligament surgery (ACL), her inclusion from the start would be a surprise.

"I think not playing any 90 minutes to go in 90 minutes would be a challenge, but she's healthy and back fully with the squad. And that is for someone who had, obviously, an ACL," Wilkinson said.

"She's been so professional and so diligent and so focused to be here. And to have her healthy and available is a testament to the hard work that she's invested. I am really happy to have her back healthy."

Wales must come up with a solution to replacing teenage defender Mayzee Davies in defence as she misses the tournament having undergone ACL surgery.

Crystal Palace defender Josie Green could come into the side, while dropping Hayley Ladd back into defence is another option, with Wales expected to stick with three central defenders.

Netherlands boss Jonker confirmed his side have doubts over two of their main attacking threats.

Manchester City forward Vivianne Miedema is fit, but having been severely hampered by injuries in the past two years, might not be risked from the start as she chases her 100th international goal (she is currently on 99).

Wolfsburg forward Lineth Beerensteyn is also a doubt, having been unable to train since Netherlands arrived in Switzerland.

Jonker revealed in his pre-match press conference that he is yet to tell his players the starting XI for their Euro opener, whereas Wilkinson says she told her players "a few days ago."

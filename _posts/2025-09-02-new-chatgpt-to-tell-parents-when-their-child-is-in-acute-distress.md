Let's dive into the details: Parents of teenage ChatGPT users will soon be able to receive a notification if the platform thinks their child is in "acute distress".

It is among a number of parental controls announced by the chatbot's maker, OpenAI.

Its safety for young users was put in the spotlight last week when a couple in California sued OpenAI over the death of their 16-year-old son, alleging ChatGPT encouraged him to take his own life.

OpenAI said it would introduce what it called "strengthened protections for teens" within the next month.

When news of the lawsuit emerged last week, OpenAI published a note on its website stating ChatGPT is trained to direct people to seek professional help when they are in trouble, such as the Samaritans in the UK.

The company, however, did acknowledge "there have been moments where our systems did not behave as intended in sensitive situations".

Now it has published a further update outlining additional actions it is planning which will allow parents to:

OpenAI said that for assessing acute distress "expert input will guide this feature to support trust between parents and teens".

The company stated that it is working with a group of specialists in youth development, mental health and "human-computer interaction" to help shape an "evidence-based vision for how AI can support people's well-being and help them thrive". 

Users of ChatGPT must be at least 13 years old, and if they are under the age of 18 they must have a parent's permission to use it, according to OpenAI.

The lawsuit filed in California last week by Matt and Maria Raine, who are the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine, was the first legal action accusing OpenAI of wrongful death.

The family included chat logs between Adam, who died in April, and ChatGPT that show him explaining he has suicidal thoughts.

They argue the programme validated his "most harmful and self-destructive thoughts", and the lawsuit accuses OpenAI of negligence and wrongful death.

This announcement from OpenAI is the latest in a series of measures from the world's leading tech firms in an effort to make the online experiences of children safer.

Many have come in as a result of new legislation, such as the Online Safety Act in the UK.

This included the introduction of age verification on Reddit, X and porn websites.

Earlier this week, Meta - who operate Facebook and Instagram -  said it would introduce more guardrails to its artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots - including blocking them from talking to teens about suicide, self-harm and eating disorders.

A US senator had launched an investigation into the tech giant after notes in a leaked internal document suggested its AI products could have "sensual" chats with teenagers.

The company described the notes in the document, obtained by Reuters, as erroneous and inconsistent with its policies which prohibit any content sexualising children.

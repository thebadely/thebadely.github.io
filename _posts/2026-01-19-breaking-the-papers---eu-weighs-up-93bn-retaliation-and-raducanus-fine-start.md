According to new developments, "Fears Trump's tariffs threat will rip Nato apart", is how the Daily Express lays bare the divisions surrounding the US president's plan to take over Greenland. The Daily Mail says the prime minister delivered an "unprecedented rebuke" to Trump, when he told him that applying tariffs to Nato allies was "wrong".

The Times says Sir Keir Starmer is opting to take a "damage-limitation approach" in the hope that a "carve out" from the tariffs can be negotiated, as was the case last year when the US unveiled sweeping trade levies. The i Paper suggests the challenge facing the prime minister is stark, saying he is in an "11th hour scramble to save the UK-US relationship".

"Blackmail", is the accusation levelled at Trump in the Daily Mirror's headline. The paper quotes the call by the Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Ed Davey, for the government to cancel the King's state visit to the US in April. He says "the UK must not be a doormat for an extortionist". The Daily Star's editorial agrees, suggesting "publicly bruising Trump's ego might be the best way to get the US president to take a step back and think".

The i Paper reports that water company bosses could be fined from their own pockets for issues such as sewage spills under a new industry regulator. A White Paper that sets out plans to reform regulation of the sector will be published by ministers this week. Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds, tells the i that bosses will have "nowhere to hide".

The Daily Telegraph describes Andrew Rosindell's defection from the Conservatives to Reform UK as a "major blow" to Kemi Badenoch. The paper says he is the fourth sitting MP to make the move after Lee Anderson, Danny Kruger and Robert Jenrick. The Daily Mail points out that Rosindell's defection will "renew claims" that Reform is home to too many Tories and "not seen as a radical new movement".

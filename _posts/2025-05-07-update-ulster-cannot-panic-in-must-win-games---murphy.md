Let's dive into the details: Ulster are three points off the play-off places with two games remaining

Head coach Richie Murphy says he does not want his Ulster squad to "feel desperate" against Munster at Thomond Park on Friday night.

Sat 12th in the United Rugby Championship (URC) table with two games remaining, the visitors know that a defeat to their Irish rivals would almost certainly end their hopes of a play-off place and a spot in next season's Champions Cup.

With Ulster three points off the top eight with another away game against Edinburgh to conclude the regular season next week, Murphy said his side are in a "must-win situation" going to Limerick.

"I don't want a situation where the players are feeling desperate. Yes, we're all desperate to win but we don't want to play like that," he said.

"We want to play for each other and play the brand of rugby that we have over the last number of weeks.

"We've got a little bit of confidence from the way we're playing, we just need to turn some performances into results."

Ulster's Henderson back in training before Munster game

Ulster have lost three consecutive games in all competitions having come out on the wrong side of results against Bordeaux-Begles, Leinster and the Sharks.

The latter was the second time this season the side have lost despite leading 19-0 at half-time after squandering a similar advantage against Cardiff in October, while they been beaten nine times in 16 league outings. 

"We know where we are, the league position doesn't lie," Murphy added.

"Over the course of the season, we haven't won as many games as we would have liked.

"When we look back and see the games that we could have won or should have won, or a bonus point here or there that we should have picked up, that frustrates us.

"Over the course of 16 games, that's where we sit. We've two more games to try and make the top eight."

Ulster could be boosted by the returns to fitness of five players with Iain Henderson, Robert Baloucoune, James Hume, Eric O'Sullivan and Sean Reffell all back in training.

After injury-hit campaigns for many of his frontline players, Murphy feels his squad is "in a really good place" coming towards the end of the season.

Should the play-off race not go their way, the former Ireland Under-20s coach still believes his overhaul of the panel is heading in the right direction.

"We don't want to not be in the top eight but if we're not, it's not the case that the place is going to shut down and move on," he added.

"We've a lot of very talented young players, we've had a really tough run of games this year, and a really tough injury profile.

"If we have to park this and move on, I can guarantee we will build and be better for next year."

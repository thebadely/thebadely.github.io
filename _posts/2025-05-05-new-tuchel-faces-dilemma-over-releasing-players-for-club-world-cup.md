Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Thomas Tuchel began an 18-month contract with England in January

England head coach Thomas Tuchel faces a dilemma over releasing his players early next month before the Club World Cup.

His side are scheduled to play two games in June - a World Cup qualifier against Andorra in Barcelona on 7 June before a friendly against Senegal at Nottingham Forest three days later.

The game at the City Ground on 10 June takes place just four days before the club tournament starts in the USA.

Players from Manchester City, Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid - who are all involved in the inaugural Club World Cup - could all be selected in Tuchel's squad for the international double-header.

Clubs involved in the Fifa event are eager for the Football Association to release players after the Andorra game but, as things stand, it is understood Tuchel is minded to keep his squad together for the Senegal friendly.

The FA is to hold further meetings when its stance regarding Club World Cup players will be confirmed. 

Although in its annual report released last week,, external the FA cited the tournament as a "significant challenge" for "protecting player welfare" which could also have "financial implications".

"These changes have the potential to significantly reduce the downtime available to elite players, affecting their recovery and overall wellbeing," the FA report said.

"The introduction of more global competitions risks devaluing traditional domestic tournaments, such as the FA Cup. and may affect the performance of our national teams due to increased player fatigue and reduced time for international squad training."

In his first meeting with his players since being appointed Gareth Southgate's successor, Tuchel told his players they only have a minimal period working together before next summer's World Cup.

Tuchel and the FA's decision over releasing players could impact as many as 12 players.

Chelsea contingent Cole Palmer, Reece James, Levi Colwill and Noni Madueke could be selected by Tuchel.

Captain Harry Kane is at Bayern Munich while Jude Bellingham plays for Real Madrid and fellow midfielder Conor Gallagher for Atletico Madrid.

Should all players remain with the England squad, Chelsea could be the worst hit.

Teams competing at the Club World Cup are required to arrive in the USA no later than three days before their opening tie.

With that in mind, Enzo Maresca's side face a potential Europa Conference League final in Poland on 28 May - three days after the final day of the Premier League season - before joining up for international duty.

Their first game of the Club World Cup is against Leon on 16 June - six days after the clash versus Senegal.

Manchester City's first game of the tournament is on 18 June versus Wydad AC.

Bayern play Auckland City and Atletico face Paris St-Germain on on 15 June while Real are up against Al Hilal on 18 June.

Speaking in March, Tuchel hinted towards his reluctance to do favours for club managers saying: "I take care of the players. We take care about the schedule. But it would be the wrong signal to tell players now 'hey, you have tough [club] matches coming up so I rest you now'.

"We do what's good for us. We monitor them, we are in contact with the clubs, we are in high-level monitoring where the statuses are known and we won't take any unprofessional risks. Because first of all I feel responsible for the players. I don't want the player to be injured.

"So this is where it is and in the end we take care of ourselves and the clubs take care of themselves, and the main focus is taking care of the players.

"I experienced it many, many times in clubs that players from South American countries don't even think about dropping one minute because they want to play for their country, they're proud to play for their country. This is also something that we have to understand and accept.

"I always accepted it as a club manager. I never got involved in line-ups. I never pushed any national coach because I was hoping that my players get picked. I was also hoping that they are proud to play."

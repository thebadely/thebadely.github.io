According to new developments, Wales men's team have not won a Six Nations game since 2023

Steve Tandy is confident Wales' players will not be distracted by the uncertainty over the future of Ospreys and Cardiff during the Six Nations.

The head coach named his squad for the championship on Tuesday but his selections were lost on another day dominated by rugby politics.

The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) announced on Monday evening that they are entering a "period of exclusivity" with potential new owners for Cardiff.

They have not revealed their preferred bidder but it understood they are Ospreys owners Y11 Sport & Media.

That would provide the WRU, who took over the Blue and Blacks in 2025, with an easier route for their desired cut from four men's professional clubs to three.

Tandy has named seven players from both Ospreys and Cardiff in his squad and acknowledges it is an unsettling situation.

"It's very similar to the autumn and we want to get connected to the boys and spend a lot of time with them," said Tandy, whose November fixtures were played while the WRU intended to go from four to two.

"I understand there's speculation and there's doubt around a lot of things, so for me it's being honest with them.

"If they've got something to share, if they're seeking more clarity or anything they want to talk about then we have to be open.

"One thing we can't do is run away from it or pretend it's not happening.

"I think that worked well for us coming into the autumn, it's far from perfect but ultimately for me it's putting the players, the staff and the people at the centre of it.

"If they've got any reservations or if they want someone to talk to or to understand I'll be doing that with the players."

Tandy did not shy away from the situation in front of the media but the former flanker knows more than most about the pain that cutting Ospreys would cause.

The 46-year-old played 102 games for the region after coming through at Neath and then led them to the Pro12 title in 2012.

"If you were part of any club it would sting and hurt," said Tandy. "There is lots of history with every club.

"I played and coached the Ospreys, I am proud of that but I know there is pride around Dragons, Cardiff and Scarlets.

"I am not going to comment on speculation but if I put myself in anyone's shoes, whoever you represent, it's going to hurt and there will be frustration and anger. Any time you lose something there will be those feelings."

Tandy refuses to speculate on Ospreys' future

Tandy knew when he left his job as Scotland defence coach last summer that the Wales job came with a lot of off-field baggage.

"That's my job â to be a head coach," he said. "I want to be the best coach for the players and for our staff.

"We want to create an environment where they love coming in and they feel part of it, and we want to make sure we connect to our public and show what the boys can do.

"I love my job, I love coming in here, and I think the players are the same. We've got to continue to build this environment."

Wales' last Six Nations win was against Italy in 2023 just weeks after a player strike had narrowly been avoided before the home defeat by England.

Tandy hopes that the situation, which has led to the Ospreys squad expressing their frustration at being left in the dark, does not lead to a repeat.

"That's more speculation. I'll constantly be in dialogue with the players, how they are feeling, any frustrations," he said.

"I truly believe a lot of the leaders have got voices. They know the environment we have and they can come and speak, share and be very open. They are not going to be judged on having a distraction or a fear."

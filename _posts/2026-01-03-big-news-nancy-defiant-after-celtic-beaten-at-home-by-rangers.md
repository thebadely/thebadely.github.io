'This is not about tactics' - Nancy speaks after derby defeat

Celtic manager Wilfried Nancy insists he is still "together with the board" and believes "we can turn things around" despite falling to a sixth loss in eight games following the derby defeat to Rangers.

The Frenchman hailed an "outstanding" first half from his team, during which they took the lead through Yang Hyun-Jun and passed up several other chances.

However, their city rivals roared back in the second period and exposed the home side's defensive fragility with a double from Youssef Chermiti and a third from Mikey Moore.

The 3-1 defeat means Rangers move level on points with second-placed Celtic, who are now six adrift of Hearts after the leaders beat Livingston later on Saturday.

While fans of the Parkhead side staged a post-match protest directed at the club board, Nancy told BBC Scotland: "It was disappointing because we deserved more today, but again we needed more goals.

"In the second half, we conceded three goals from throw-ins. It's difficult to accept, but it's reality. This is not about the players or the tactics, this is about moments. 

"This is not about myself, this is about disappointing the fans because I know the meaning of this game. I can understand the disappointment, but I also saw what we're able to do. 

"We are really close, there are many things that can turn around. If it was not the case, I would not talk like this. I really believe we can turn things around.

"We are together with the board."

Sportsound pundit Michael Stewart reacts to Old Firm derby

Former Scotland midfielder Michael Stewart on BBC Sportsound: "Untenable position for Nancy. He looks like a broken man. The disconnect between the manager and the team is so stark. 

"It is not something that can continue and it should not have happened. The people on the board who facilitated this should be shown the door as well. Celtic are in an absolute state."

Former Celtic goalkeeper Pat Bonner on BBC Sportsound: "The problems aren't high up the pitch for Celtic, the problems are the shape at the back and the defensive qualities."

Former Rangers striker and coach Billy Dodds on BBC Sportsound: "As much as Rangers have done the right things in this second half, Celtic have been just brutally bad.

"Celtic have just capitulated. Something has to give, there is no doubt."

Former Celtic striker Chris Sutton on Sky Sports: "We've seen this movie before with Nancy's Celtic.

"You can score, but you've got to defend. This team don't do that."

Disgruntled Celtic fans gathered outside the stadium post-match to protest against the club's board

Pete: First 45 minutes looked great, post half-time we looked like amateurs. Nancy has one way of playing and can't react to opposing teams adapting to it. Get him out now!

Iain: It's very painfully obvious that Celtic cannot play to Nancy's system, these players are not bad players all of a sudden. They played well enough for Martin O'Neill so the answer is self-explanatory. End of.

James: The board are completely and utterly to blame. I feel sorry for Nancy as he should never been appointed in the first place, but he'll be used as the scapegoat. We don't have the players with a fully fit squad for 3-4-3, but we have so many key players out. O'Neill should have been given it until the summer and have a new manager start day one of pre-season.

Andy: Nancy has to go. I've been one of those wanting to give him a chance, but there is no progress. We don't have the best of defences to begin with, but he's made it worse. He has a formation that he won't change and there is no actual style of play. It's all just not funny anymore. We've been beaten by the poorest Rangers team there has been in decades with a terrible striker that is actually better than ours! Rant over... Nancy must go.

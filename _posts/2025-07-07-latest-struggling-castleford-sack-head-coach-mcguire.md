Experts revealed that Danny McGuire won four of his 18 games as Castleford Tigers head coach

Castleford Tigers have sacked head coach Danny McGuire after less than nine months in charge.

The 42-year-old took over from Craig Lingard on a three-year deal in October, having previously been Lingard's assistant.

The Tigers got off to a poor start to the season when they were beaten by Championship side Bradford Bulls in the Challenge Cup.

Thursday's home defeat by fellow strugglers Huddersfield Giants was a 13th loss in 17 Super League games and chairman Martin Jepson called it "hugely disappointing" in the statement announcing McGuire's departure.

Director of rugby Chris Chester has been placed in charge on an interim basis.

"It has been a challenging season, but in particular, the result and performance in last week's game against Huddersfield were hugely disappointing for me and everybody involved with the club," Jepson said.

"The board felt that a change of direction was therefore needed.

"I would like to put on record my thanks to Danny for his hard work at the club over the past two years, both as an assistant and head coach, and I wish him well in the future."

Huddersfield beat Cas for third win of season

McGuire enjoyed a trophy-laden playing career as a half-back with Leeds Rhinos.

The one-time Super League top try scorer won eight Grand Finals, three World Club Challenges and two Challenge Cups before ending his playing days with Hull KR.

He went into coaching with the Craven Park side and, after a spell as their head of recruitment, he moved on to Tony Smith's coaching staff for the 2021 season.

After Smith quit, McGuire was placed in interim charge of the side in 2022 and led them to five wins from 10 matches before returning to his role as assistant under Willie Peters.

His first role as a head coach always looked like it would be difficult, with the Tigers coming into this season off the back of a 10th-placed finish last time out.

Two of their four wins this year have come against beleaguered Salford Red Devils and they were hammered 48-0 at home by Hull KR in June.

The week after that heavy loss they put in a spirited performance in a controversial defeat by second-placed Wigan Warriors, with McGuire calling some of the decisions in the match "pathetic"  and "horrific" after the game.

Thursday's reverse by lowly Huddersfield saw them concede 18 unanswered points in the second half in a performance McGuire labelled as "flat".

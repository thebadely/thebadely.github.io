Here’s what you need to know: Luke Littler beat Michael van Gerwen in the 2024 Bahrain Masters final

World champion Luke Littler beat veteran Paul Lim 6-1 to reach the quarter-finals of the Bahrain Masters.

On his first trip to the oche since retaining his world title at Alexandra Palace on 3 January, Littler put in a statement performance.

The 19-year-old had an average of 106 as he brushed aside 71-year-old Singaporean Lim.

"Not a chance! I will say it now," England's Littler replied when asked if he will still be playing into his 70s.

"He's just class and I wonder when is he going to retire? He still goes very strong in the practice room as well."

Littler faces Wales' Gerwyn Price, who saw off Motomu Sakai 6-3, in the last eight. Price was last year's runner-up in Bahrain after beating Littler in the semi-finals.

Second seed Luke Humphries is also through after a 6-0 win against Abdulla Saeed, while World Championship runner-up Gian van Veen defeated Man Lok Leung 6-2.

Michael van Gerwen is set to play defending champion Stephen Bunting in the quarter-finals.

Let's dive into the details: Michail Antonio joined West Ham from Nottingham Forest in 2015

West Ham have yet to decide on Michail Antonio's future at the club as boss Graham Potter acknowledged the striker is in a "unique" situation.

Antonio, 34, has not played for the Hammers since he suffered a broken leg in a car crash in December, but is is out of contract in the summer.

The Jamaica international had surgery after the accident in Essex and spent more than three weeks in hospital.

However, West Ham's all-time leading Premier League scorer with 68 goals from 268 games has since returned to light training.

"When we have something to announce, we will announce it," Potter said when asked about Antonio's future at a news conference on Friday.

"It's a unique situation with Michail in terms of how he's recovering from his injury, he's doing fantastically well, he's going through a lot, we'll support him and that's the main thing at the moment."

Meanwhile, West Ham are set to release four long-serving players when their contracts expire. 

Lukasz Fabianski, Aaron Cresswell, Vladimir Coufal and Danny Ings will leave the London Stadium at the end of the season. 

Left-back Cresswell, 35, has been with West Ham 11 seasons, and holds a record for the longest unbroken stint as a top-flight player with the club.

Goalkeeper Fabianski 40, right-back Coufal and striker Ings, both 32, were all members of the squad which won the Uefa Conference League in 2023.

"Aaron, Lukasz, Vladimir and Danny have been a pleasure to work with in my time here so far," Potter added.

"They are all brilliant professionals on and off the pitch, with fantastic experience in the Premier League, and clearly loved and admired by their team-mates and everyone here at the club.

"We felt it was important to confirm this news now, out of respect for them and the service they have given to the club, and to allow our supporters to show their appreciation at our final home match of the season."

The Hammers visit Manchester United on Sunday (14:15 BST), with their final home match against Nottingham Forest on Sunday, 18 May.

Experts revealed that Danny Rohl's Rangers are on an eight-match winning streak

Watch Rangers v Dundee highlights

25/01/2026

Danny Rohl is relishing Rangers' role as the "hunter" in the Scottish Premiership title race after delivering a "statement" victory to reduce Hearts' advantage at the top.

The 3-0 win over Dundee cut the gap between Rangers and Hearts to four points, with Celtic's draw against the league leaders allowing the Ibrox side to move above Martin O'Neill's team into second.

Rohl savoured "a big, big win" - his side's eighth successive victory in all competitions and sixth in the league - and is eyeing further signings in the final week of the transfer window to add more fuel to their momentum.

The hosts toiled to break down stubborn Dundee until captain James Tavernier opened the scoring from the penalty spot with his 100th league goal for the club before Danilo and Djeidi Gassama added late strikes.

"You felt that in the stadium after the whistle, the stands are full now. Big, big positive energy," Rohl said.

"Danilo scored, this is great, Gassama scored. All the subs tried and helped the team. It was again a great team performance. It feels great with eight wins [in a row in all competitions]. 

"It's a statement, especially from the point we were at. I spoke about being a hunter and this is still where we are. We want to hunt. We want to be on front foot.

"We want to win our games. If you do this, then in the next 15 games there is a big opportunity there. It's still hard work to do. It's not easy to win games in this league. If you hunt, you can be successful."

How many points will it take to win Scottish Premiership?

Rangers, who host Hearts on 15 February, have signed three players in January, with Tochi Chukwuani and Andreas Skov Olsen making their first starts against Dundee, and Rohl describing their 50 or so minutes on the pitch as "solid". Tuur Rommens has yet to feature since joining.

Rangers are seeking more arrivals and Rohl added: "Let's see what's in the market. The final week is coming, we have to make good decisions. 

"It's possible. It's about timing. It's like dominoes. You have to wait sometimes, but if it's on and if there's a great opportunity then we will try looking for more players to strengthen the squad."

Former Rangers forward Rory Loy was on BBC Sportsound punditry duty at Ibrox and believes Rohl is "doing it the right way" since taking charge in October following Russell Martin's shambolic stint.

"You win games first," said Loy. "You need to win games. He's come in and his main priority has been, 'by hook or by crook, we get three points' - and it's stood him in good stead. He's making a very good job of winning when they're not playing all that well.

"It was a bit of a struggle for large periods. For long, long spells of that game, it wasn't pretty at all. Three-nil probably flattered them in the end."

James Tavernier's opener against Dundee was his 54th converted penalty for Rangers in the league

Tavernier said it was a "really proud moment" to reach the 100-goal league milestone and paid tribute to his team-mates at Ibrox since he joined in 2015.

The right-back has scored 139 Rangers goals overall and has enjoyed the success of promotion in 2016, Premiership title glory in 2021, as well as winning the League Cup and Scottish Cup on one occasion each and some memorable goals and runs in Europe.

However, the skipper - who two years ago become British football's highest-scoring defender - has also endured disappointments as Rangers have often finished runners-up to Celtic in domestic tournaments.

Of the 34-year-old's century of league goals, 15 were free-kicks and 54 penalties.

"Seeing the fans that stayed back, it's really nice to see," Tavernier told club media.

"A lot of the boys have maybe not experienced that, but it's good to see. The boys are really taking in what it means.

"It's down to us to keep that going, to keep really working hard, putting in the performances but ultimately getting that win. It's just about the consistency."

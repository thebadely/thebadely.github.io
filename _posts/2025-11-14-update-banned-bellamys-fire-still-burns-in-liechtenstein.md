Experts revealed that Former captain Craig Bellamy won 78 caps for Wales and scored 19 goals

World Cup qualifier: Liechtenstein v Wales

Venue: Rheinpark Stadion, Vaduz Date: Saturday, 15 November Kick-off: 17:00 GMT

Coverage: Live on BBC iPlayer, BBC Two, BBC Sounds, BBC Radio Wales, Radio Cymru and Sports Extra, BBC Sport website and app, plus live text commentary

When Wales last played in Liechtenstein 16 years ago, they did so without Craig Bellamy because the then Manchester City forward was suspended after picking up two of his 101 career yellow cards.

Wales return to the tiny Alpine principality for a World Cup qualifier on Saturday, when Bellamy - now head coach - will be banned again, having been cautioned for dissent as he was in 2009.

Much has been made of the 46-year-old's evolution from fiery, confrontational player to methodical, deep-thinking tactician.

But there is something reassuring about the fact that Bellamy still has an inner fire that cannot quite be extinguished.

So he will have to watch from the stands in Vaduz after receiving his second booking for dissent in this campaign, during last month's defeat against Belgium. Old habits and all that.

"I've always been envious of one or two other sports who are able to do it, but I understand the way we play and what football is," said Bellamy. 

"It's nice having someone on the side yelling absolute nonsense that no-one can understand because I never did when I was on the pitch.

"Actually I might enjoy it more, being upstairs where I can see the game from new viewpoints. So it's going to be a little bit different, but the work's done, we've gone through the scenarios.

"If anything does happen, we have real capable coaches who will be able to communicate better than I'm able to do. So I'm completely comfortable with it."

Assistant boss Piet Cremers will lead the team in Bellamy's absence, with fellow coaches Andrew Crofts and James Rowberry alongside him.

Whether or not Bellamy's influence is diminished by his banishment from the touchline, anything other than a comfortable Wales win in Liechtenstein is unthinkable.

There are only four countries in the world ranked lower than the Liechtensteiners in 206th, and their predominantly part-time team - featuring students and office workers - have failed to score a single goal in their six games of this campaign, conceding 23.

Wales are aiming to win in Vaduz and then beat North Macedonia in Cardiff on Tuesday to finish second in Group J and secure home advantage for their World Cup play-off semi-final in March.

There are scenarios where Wales could finish ahead of North Macedonia with a draw at Cardiff City Stadium, but that would require a winning margin of at least six goals in Vaduz.

Bellamy will have both games in mind when he selects his team to face Liechtenstein, mindful of the fact that six of his squad are one yellow card away from suspension.

Ethan Ampadu, Joe Rodon, Chris Mepham, Jordan James, Josh Sheehan and Neco Williams will all have to be on their guard, while Harry Wilson will be unavailable as he serves a one-match ban for getting his second booking of the campaign last month.

"Of course, we have one eye [on suspensions] but, for us, it's play the strongest possible team we have right now, take care of what we feel might be Liechtenstein's weaknesses," said Bellamy.

"Tomorrow's the most important game because it's our next game. Now, if it's actually turning out the way we want it to be, then we'll start having an eye on it [North Macedonia], but not until then.

"We're adaptive, whatever happens, but we believe it's in our hands to give ourselves a home play-off."

Rheinpark Stadion is home to FC Vaduz as well as Liechtenstein

This will feel like a home game for Wales, albeit on a much smaller scale.

An estimated 3,000 Wales fans will be at Rheinpark Stadion, filling three of the four stands at a ground which holds a little under 6,000.

The travelling support will swell the local population too. At 41,000, the entire country of Liechtenstein is home to fewer people than Cwmbran.

In terms of scenery, however, there are not many stadiums which can compete with this one on the banks of the river Rhine, in the shadow of the mountains just a few metres away from the border with Switzerland.

"As a head coach, I have to be honest, the support has been the most pleasing side," said Bellamy.

"I look back at Montenegro, it was like a monsoon, and then Iceland, Turkey, even in Kazakhstan, the amount of support we'd take, I'd never quite seen it.

"It's been a credit to the previous managers who've been able to build this, qualifying in 2016 gained that momentum and we've not let it go. We used to be envious of other countries having that - I feel we have that.

"I feel we're a big football nation. I always thought we were and, tomorrow night, you'll get that feeling again. We've just got to give them that tournament to get to."

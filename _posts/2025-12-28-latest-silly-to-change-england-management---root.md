It has been recently reported that Joe Root has played 17 previous Tests in Australia without winning

Joe Root says the England players are "absolutely committed" to the team's management and it would be "silly" to make changes following the Ashes series defeat.

Captain Ben Stokes, head coach Brendon McCullum and director of cricket Rob Key have all come under pressure after the series in Australia was lost with defeats in the first three Tests.

But England won the fourth Test - a two-dayer in Melbourne - to end an 18-match winless streak down under dating back to 2011.

All of Stokes, McCullum and Key have expressed a desire to stay on after the Ashes and their cases would be strengthened by another win in the fifth Test in Sydney, starting next Sunday (23:30 GMT, Saturday).

"In terms of the playing group, we're absolutely committed to the management," said batter Root, England's all-time leading Test run-scorer.

"Yes, we can be better and there are certain areas that we'll continue to keep working at, but that management work extremely hard.

"They might do things in a slightly different way, but I think we've made great strides as a group and a big reason for it is because of the guys we have behind us."

Root was captain on England's last tour of Australia, a 4-0 defeat in 2021-22. The tour cost coach Chris Silverwood and director of cricket Ashley Giles their jobs, while Root would later resign.

Stokes, McCullum and Key all came in for the summer of 2022 and initially revitalised the Test team. McCullum was handed a contract extension until 2027, including taking charge of the white-ball teams in 2024.

Stokes aligned his England deal to the same time period just before this Ashes series.

While all-rounder Stokes would probably remain captain after the Ashes if fitness permits, the futures of McCullum and Key will come in for scrutiny â a situation complicated by a T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka early next year.

The coach and director of cricket do not only have to answer for England's results, but also their planning, preparation and off-field activities.

Key said he would investigate reports of excessive drinking on England's break from the Ashes in Noosa between the second and third Test, while he also apologised for what he said was a "20%" performance in the series.

But Root defended the England leadership when he said: "You look at the group of players we've got and you look at the guys that were involved in the team when I was captain, four years ago, and you look at their records individually, and every single one of them has improved as a player.

"This team has improved. I think it would be silly for the amount of hard work and things that have been doneâ¦"

Root, who first toured Australia in 2013-14, played in all but one of the 18 winless matches.

The Yorkshireman turns 35 on Tuesday and seems sure to feature in the next Ashes at home in the summer of 2027 when England will look to win the urn for the first time in 12 years.

By the time England next tour Australia in 2029-30, Root will be almost 39.

With there being a question over whether or not Root makes another tour, he was asked about finally earning at least one win in this country and replied: "It would be better if we win next week as well.

"A series like this is steeped in history and historically, it's been very difficult for us to win here. For us to do that, if we can build on it and do it again next time it's momentum in the right direction for the next tour here.

"There are things that we'll have to keep looking to learn from and develop from, but I try not to do too many regrets. I think you've got to look forward.

"You've got to look at how you can affect things in the near future. That starts with Sydney, and then we'll go from there."

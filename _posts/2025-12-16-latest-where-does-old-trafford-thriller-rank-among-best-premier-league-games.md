Kroupi levels for Bournemouth in eight-goal thriller against Man Utd

When it comes to the greatest Premier League game ever, where do you even start?

Manchester United and Bournemouth served up an eight-goal thriller on Monday, which former Liverpool and England defender Jamie Carragher described as the "best game" so far this season in the English top flight.  

Speaking on Sky Sports, Carragher said: "That's what makes the Premier League the greatest product in the world. 

"For the majority of that Manchester United were absolutely fantastic. Bournemouth were not at the races at all in the first half but they were fantastic in the second half. What a game. Brilliant.

"I think we have just seen the best game of the Premier League season so far." 

The Red Devils famously played out a 5-5 draw at West Brom in Sir Alex Ferguson's final match in charge of the club in 2013. 

And United's 4-4 draw against the Cherries was the 17th time the scoreline has occurred in the Premier League era. 

But where does Monday's match rank among some of the other remarkable contests we have seen down the years?

This result played a major factor in the outcome of the title race eventually won by Manchester United

Having blown a 10-point lead at the top of the table, Newcastle's title hopes suffered a major blow as they lost a classic in stoppage time at Anfield despite having led twice. 

"Collymore closing in..."

Sergio Aguero's late winner delivered the most dramatic end to a Premier League title race

In an extraordinary conclusion to the 2011-12 campaign, Manchester City scored twice in stoppage time to beat Queens Park Rangers on the final day and win their first title in 44 years.

Sergio Aguero's famous late winner ensured City pipped rivals Manchester United, who had already won that day, to the trophy on goal difference.

Andrey Arshavin enjoyed his finest night in an Arsenal shirt at Anfield

On another remarkable evening at Anfield, Arsenal's Andrey Arshavin produced a stunning individual display - netting all four goals for the Gunners to deliver a serious blow to Liverpool's title ambitions.

Cheick Tiote scored a sensational late equaliser for Newcastle

Arsenal were 4-0 up at and cruising at half-time as they looked to chase down league leaders Manchester United. 

However, Abou Diaby was then sent off for the Gunners as Newcastle produced a stunning comeback to earn an improbable draw - with Cheick Tiote's thumping 87th-minute strike clinching the point.

With Manchester United having beaten Newcastle to the title the previous season, this felt like payback for Kevin Keegan and his players, who had also suffered a 4-0 reverse to Sir Alex Ferguson's side at Wembley in the Charity Shield just weeks earlier.

David Beckham scored Manchester United's fifth goal

Manchester United staged a magnificent comeback from 3-0 down at the break to overwhelm Tottenham at White Hart Lane. 

Dean Richards, Les Ferdinand and Christian Ziege all scored for the hosts but a transformed United hit back through Andy Cole, Laurent Blanc, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Juan Sebastian Veron and David Beckham.

Michael Owen provided the decisive moment for the hosts late on

Michael Owen's winner deep into stoppage time gave Manchester United a dramatic victory in a classic derby at Old Trafford.

The moment prompted Ferguson to set off on an impromptu wild dance along the touchline, while City boss Mark Hughes - whose side had come from behind three times - questioned why the game had gone on for six added minutes rather than the four allocated.

Mark Viduka scored all four goals for Leeds

Liverpool had gone 2-0 up early on with goals from Sami Hyypia and Christian Ziege, but Mark Viduka scored either side of half-time to drag Leeds level.

Vladimir Smicer restored Liverpool's advantage, before two goals in three minutes from former Celtic forward Viduka secured an incredible win for the hosts.

Crystal Palace's late show had huge implications in the title race

Title-chasing Liverpool had just lost to Chelsea at Anfield, but looked set to power themselves back into the race when they took a commanding 3-0 lead at Selhurst Park.

But they squandered that advantage in a chaotic final 11 minutes, leaving Luis Suarez in tears at the final whistle. Man City went on to win the league by two points. 

This was another Arsenal v Manchester United match packed with incident

A tight pitch, a packed Highbury and another compelling contest between two of English football's heavyweights. 

The Gunners went two goals up courtesy of Nicolas Anelka and Patrick Vieira only for the champions to draw level thanks to two Teddy Sheringham efforts. 

But in a season when Arsene Wenger's side were to wrestle the title away from Manchester, David Platt scored the winner. 

Everton have not been relegated from the top flight since 1950-51

Everton are one of only six sides that have never been relegated from the Premier League, but they were on the brink at 2-0 down to Wimbledon in the first 20 minutes of the final day of the 1993-94 season.

However, a Graham Stuart double helped the Toffees preserve their stay in the top division, with his winner coming in the 81st minute, which kick-started jubilant scenes at Goodison Park.

There were fireworks in the Highbury tunnel before play even got under way

Most people will remember this game because of the fiery exchange between captains Patrick Vieira and Roy Keane in the tunnel before the game, but the 90 minutes itself were just as thrilling.

Vieira opened the scoring for Arsenal before they were pegged back by an Ashley Cole own goal. 

Another Gunners legend, Dennis Bergkamp, helped the hosts retake the lead before two goals from a young Cristiano Ronaldo and a delightful John O'Shea chip stunned Arsene Wenger's side.

Chelsea supporters enjoyed dashing the title hopes of their London rivals Tottenham

A match that meant most for a side that wasn't involved - the day that Leicester City were crowned champions will go down in footballing history.

Two first-half goals from Harry Kane and Heung-min Son gave Tottenham hope of chasing the Foxes down at the business end of the season. 

But Gary Cahill and Eden Hazard scored to get Jamie Vardy and his Leicester team-mates' party started as tempers flared in the second half of a match dubbed the 'Battle of the Bridge'.

Eli Junior Kroupi's goal rounded off a thrilling evening at Old Trafford

Manchester United and Bournemouth played out the latest Premier League classic at Old Trafford. 

The hosts led three times and thought they had won the game when they scored twice in 129 seconds to turn a 3-2 deficit into a 4-3 advantage. 

But Eli Junior Kroupi's strike in the 84th minute pegged Ruben Amorim's side back once again as both sides had to settle for a share of the spoils.

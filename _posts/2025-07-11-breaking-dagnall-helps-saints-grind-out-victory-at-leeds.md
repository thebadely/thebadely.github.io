It has been recently reported that Owen Dagnall scored the night's only try

Betfred Super League

Leeds (0) 0

St Helens (6) 6

Try: Dagnall Goal: Lomax

Owen Dagnall's first-half try and a penalty goal from Jonny Lomax saw St Helens to a gritty victory over Leeds at Headingley.

Dagnall spun his way over in the left corner after 15 minutes and Lomax extended the lead from the tee before half-time.

After the break, Leeds thought they had scored through James McDonnell but the video referee ruled it out and the hosts wasted good territory.

Agnatius Paasi's yellow card 13 minutes from time made life tougher for Saints but they clung on to move above Leeds into third in the Super League table.

Leeds were hoping to build on last weekend's impressive victory over league leaders Hull KR but, despite enjoying the better of territory and possession, were not accurate enough to breach a solid Saints defence.

They fell behind early in the game when the visitors spread the play left from 20 metres out, Moses Mbye delayed a pass to create space for Dagnall and the 19-year-old winger slipped past one tackle on the outside before stepping inside another to score.

Jake Connor's high tackle then allowed Lomax to add two more points.

Saints went close to a second try when Kyle Feldt sprinted to the corner before Lomax's grubber in goal was just touched down in time by the home side.

Mbye then missed a drop-goal with the final act of the half as Saints went in 6-0 ahead.

Leeds thought they had scored as a high kick found grass and fell for Brodie Croft to put James McDonnell over, but the video referee ruled it out for a push by Harry Newman on Saints' Mark Percival as he tried to catch the kick.

Leeds continued to threaten but twice threw loose passes into touch with the line in sight and Matt Whitley's interception ended another promising attack.

The hosts also failed to take advantage of Paasi's yellow card for a high tackle as Saints, who had not lost at Headingley since 2017, held firm.

An inexplicable knock-on from Alex Walmsley gave Leeds one final attack but Kallum Watkins was held on the last tackle and St Helens clung on for their 12th win of the season.

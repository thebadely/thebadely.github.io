Scorecard

Rilee Rossouw and Hasan Nawaz both hit centuries as Quetta Gladiators thrashed Islamabad United by 109 runs in the Pakistan Super League.

South African Rossouw scored 104 from 46 balls before Nawaz hit the final ball of the innings for four to reach his hundred in 45 deliveries and power Quetta to 263-3 - the highest score in a PSL match.

It was the first time two batters had scored a century in the same innings in the tournament and only the 10th time the feat had been achieved in all men's T20s.

Islamabad collapsed to 68-8 in reply and they were bowled out for 154 as Mohammad Amir finished with 3-6 from two overs.

Left-hander Rossouw came in with Quetta at 24-1 in the third over and hit 14 fours and six sixes, reaching his century in 44 deliveries.

After Saud Shakeel was out for 23, Rossouw and 22-year-old right-hander Nawaz put on 134 in 61 balls.

Rossouw was caught at long-on in the 16th over, but Nawaz continued his assault by dominating a partnership of 69 in 26 balls with New Zealander Mark Chapman, hitting nine sixes in his superb knock.

Nawaz scored 105 not out for Pakistan in March against New Zealand in his first series, but made three ducks and one in his other four innings.

Quetta had already secured a place in the PSL play-offs but are now guaranteed to finish in the top two, thus avoiding the eliminator.

Islamabad need to beat Karachi Kings in their final match on Saturday 10 May to guarantee a play-off place.

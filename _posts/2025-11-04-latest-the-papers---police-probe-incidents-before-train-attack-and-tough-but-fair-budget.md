Here’s what you need to know: Many of the front pages focus on speculation that Chancellor Rachel Reeves is preparing to increase income tax in this month's Budget.

The Guardian says Reeves is expected to "lay the groundwork" when she makes a speech at Downing Street on Tuesday morning, adding she is going to be "candid" about the choices ahead. The Daily Telegraph says the Chancellor is expected to say she's taking the "necessary steps" to fix public finances for "years to come".

The Financial Times reports that Labour MPs are now "resigned" to Rachel Reeves breaking the party's election manifesto promise not to raise rates of income tax, national insurance or value added tax (VAT). It adds that the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer heightened speculation when he told Labour MPs that the budget would "reject" austerity. "Reeves softens us up for tax betrayal," is the Daily Mail's take.

The investigation into the mass stabbing on a train travelling between Doncaster and London on Saturday continues to feature prominently in most of the papers. The Daily Mirror's front page focuses on the bravery displayed by some of those on board the train who intervened, including a passenger, with the headline: "Heroes of the train horror."

The Daily Telegraph says its seen a whistleblowing memo accusing the BBC of editing a speech by Donald Trump to make it appear he had encouraged the 2021 Capitol riots. The claims relate to an edition of Panorama shown last year. The concerns were raised in a 19-page dossier written by a former independent external adviser to the corporation's editorial guidelines and standards committee. In a statement, the BBC said it did not comment on leaked documents but added that when the corporation received feedback it took it seriously.

The Times reports that the government is to scrap the English baccalaureate, a performance measure used by schools in England that tracks pupil attainment in core GCSE subjects. As part of the changes, the paper says, schools will also no longer be assessed on the number of pupils taking modern foreign languages.

And as David Beckham prepares to receive his knighthood at Windsor Castle today, the Daily Mail says his wife Victoria has made his suit for the occasion. "Suits you sir!" is the headline.

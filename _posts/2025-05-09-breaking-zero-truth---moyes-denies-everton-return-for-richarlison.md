Let's dive into the details: Richarlison has scored 20 goals in 87 appearances for Tottenham

Everton manager David Moyes has dismissed suggestions he wants to bring striker Richarlison back to the club this summer.

The Brazilian left Everton for Tottenham three years ago in a Â£60m deal but has struggled for form and fitness at Spurs.

Reports claimed Moyes was interested in the 27-year-old, who has two years left on his contract.

However, the Scot distanced himself from a move for Richarlison, who scored 53 goals in 152 games all competitions for the Toffees between 2018 and 2022 after joining from Watford.

"Richarlison is a really good player and someone I've liked," Moyes told a news conference on Friday.

"But I can only tell you there is zero truth in that from my side."

Moyes also responded to recent comments by Abdoulaye Doucoure, who is one of 13 players out of contract at the club this summer.

Midfielder Doucoure, who has two caps for Mali, spoke on former goalkeeper Ben Foster's podcast this week and said there had been "no talks" over a new deal.

The 32-year-old went on to say he would not accept a pay cut and felt he deserved an improved offer from Everton.

But Moyes added: "Some of the games he's played very well but he is obviously no spring chicken, so we have to make sure we have other replacements when required.

"We are making lots of decisions behind the scenes. It is good to have so many [players] that want to stay."

Moyes confirmed Doucoure will be available for Everton's Premier League fixture at Fulham after he missed their last match against Ipswich due to a "personal issue".

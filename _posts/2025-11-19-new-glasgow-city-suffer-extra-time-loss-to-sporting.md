Here’s what you need to know: Telma Encarnacao scored three times over the two matches with Glasgow City

Sporting Club scored two extra-time goals to end Glasgow City's Europa Cup run in Lisbon.

Nicole Kozlova had headed the visitors in front late in the first half to establish a 2-1 aggregate lead.

However, Telma Encarnacao's smart finish took the game to an additional half hour and the home striker grabbed another, before Carla Armengol set Sporting up for a quarter-final against Hammarby or Ajax.

The Portuguese side started and finished strongly, with City goalkeeper Lee Gibson busy in the opening minutes.

Having been under the cosh, the SWPL leaders began to find some rhythm and stunned their hosts by taking the lead four minutes before the break.

A deep free-kick from Lisa Evans was helped on by Kimberley Smit, with Kozlova ghosting in to finish from close range.

The Ukraine international threatened again before the break and City opened the second half in promising fashion, with two efforts from Linda Motlhalo.

But Sporting then took a grip on the game again as they pressed for an equaliser.

City's resistance was broken by a straight ball over the top as Telma swivelled to beat Gibson with a first-time strike.

The Portuguese forward, who also scored in the first leg, then hit the post with fierce free-kick on 87 minutes, with the rebound smashed inches wide.

Claudia Neto also went close as City clung on desperately.

An Ashley Barron header looped over as Sporting carried that attacking momentum into extra-time and it was no surprise when Telma stole between the visiting centre-halves to nod home.

Shortly after the change of ends, Armengol settled the contest with a clipped finish over Gibson's reach.

Glasgow City head coach Leanne Ross: "I don't think we created enough when we had the ball, but I thought we defended well for long spells.

"I'm just really proud of the effort that we got from every single player in the squad and what we've achieved on this European journey.

"We'll use this as motivation for the rest of the season. This is where we want to be so we need to make sure we keep doing well in the domestic league."

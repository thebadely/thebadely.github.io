According to new developments, Fran Wilson, who retired from international cricket in 2021, returned to Somerset this season

Somerset batter and England World Cup winner Fran Wilson has announced her retirement from cricket and will become Gloucestershire Women's new head coach.

The 33-year-old returned to Somerset in 2025 for a second spell, as the women's side turned professional, and scored 574 runs in 28 matches.

She previously played for the club between 2006 and 2014 and scored more than 2,500 runs in List A and T20 games.

Wilson played 64 times for England across three formats and was part of the team that won the 2017 World Cup before she retired from international cricket in 2021.

"I have decided that the 2025 season was my last and that I will be hanging up my bat - for good this time," Wilson told the Somerset website., external

"What a ride it's been, one that's taken me to all corners of the globe with England and then in more recent times back to the West Country.

"To have a locker in the changing room at the CACG [Somerset's County Ground] was beyond my wildest dreams as a young player. 

"To know this opportunity is now normal for women is incredible and to have been a part of the growth of the game is something I take immense pride in."

Gloucestershire was one of 10 clubs given Tier 2 status by the English and Wales Cricket Board for 2025.

They finished bottom of the South group with one win in eight games in the Vitality Blast 2 this season and fifth in the One-Day Cup women's league 2 table, with five wins out of nine matches.

Wilson said the goal was to build "sustainable success" to allow the club to move up to Tier 1 status.

"I've done a lot of coaching alongside playing over the last five or six years, but it's really exciting to step into that journey fully, especially with Gloucestershire, a great club that I've been involved with for a long time," Wilson said.

Wilson returned to Somerset for the 2025 season as the club went professional

Wilson made her England debut in 2010 aged 19 but it was not until 2016 that she became a regular in the international squad.

During the 50-over World Cup triumph in 2017, she played in eight of England's nine matches including the final against India. 

She was also part of the team that reached the T20 World Cup semi-finals in 2020.

Domestically, Wilson won the Kia Super League title twice with Western Storm and has also represented Sunrisers, Kent and Gloucestershire and played in four editions of The Hundred.

Somerset director of cricket Andy Hurry said Wilson had left a "lasting mark" on the women's game.

"Ahead of her now is an amazing opportunity to draw from all that experience as she takes the next step on her journey," he added.

"On behalf of all the players and staff both here at Somerset CCC and across the game, we would like to take this opportunity to recognise her achievements and thank her for her contributions and commitment both on and off the field, and for all the lasting memories she has given us all."

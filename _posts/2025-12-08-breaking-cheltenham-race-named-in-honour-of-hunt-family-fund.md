According to new developments, The big race at Cheltenham on Saturday will be run in support of a charitable initiative created by BBC racing commentator John Hunt and his daughter Amy.

The Hunt Family Fund was set up after John's wife, Carol, and their daughters Hannah and Louise were murdered at their home in Bushey, Hertfordshire in July 2024.

Saturday's December Gold Cup will carry the name of the fund, which aims to support causes relating to young women.

Amy Hunt said: "Cheltenham have been so supportive to both dad and myself and to run Saturday's big race in honour of mum and my sisters, acknowledging their amazing lives as well as driving forward the support for women of all ages, is a wonderful gesture.

"Dad has been coming to Cheltenham all of his adult life, he loves the place and will be commentating on the race for BBC Radio 5 Live.

"It will be an honour for us all to be there to present the prizes for such a fantastic race."

Guy Lavender, chief executive of Cheltenham Racecourse, added: "John and Amy Hunt are two outstanding people and how they have faced the world with such courage, dignity and resilience since the tragic events of July last year is truly humbling.

"The team at Cheltenham wanted to assist the Hunt Family Fund and hopefully we can help to highlight the important causes which the fund is helping and also provide a fitting tribute to another three outstanding people - Carol, Hannah and Louise Hunt."

The fund is currently running a silent auction,, external which ends on Thursday, with lots including a tour of Willie Mullins' stable and an opportunity to meet former England footballer Michael Owen and look around his Manor House Stables.

Experts revealed that Suella Braverman's defection from the Conservatives to Reform UK features widely. The Daily Mirror says Nigel Farage has welcomed "another Tory has-been into his ranks". The Guardian says the Conservatives are facing a "backlash" for initially suggesting she had defected following mental health issues. The Sun calls the Tory statement an "extraordinary slur". The i Paper quotes the ex-deputy speaker, Nigel Evans, who called the comments an "absolute disgrace".

"China hacked phones in Number 10" is the headline on the front of the Daily Telegraph. The paper says a "years-long spying operation targeted senior figures", including aides to Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak. The government declined to comment on the story. The Chinese embassy said China was a "staunch defender of cyber security" and that it had been "resolute in combatting all kinds of malign cyber activities".

The Daily Mail leads on the letter from Labour MPs to Sir Keir Starmer, criticising the decision to block Andy Burnham from running in a forthcoming by-election. The paper says MPs have warned that the prime minister's strike against the Greater Manchester mayor has "hastened his demise". The Times says senior Labour figures have privately conceded that they expect to lose the by-election in Gorton and Denton. Other sources say they're "not writing the seat off".

A few papers report on a possible announcement by the Treasury of a package of support for the pub sector in England. The Financial Times says it will be worth £100m a year. The Treasury tells the paper that Sir Keir and the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, "have been clear they are determined to support" pubs. But the Telegraph says the tax relief is expected to be temporary.

The Daily Express marks Holocaust Memorial Day by devoting its front page to an 80-year-old woman who was born in a concentration camp. The paper pictures Eva Clarke looking directly at the camera, and says despite having "15 of her family murdered by the Nazis", she is "still hopeful for a better future" if we tackle "rising antisemitism".

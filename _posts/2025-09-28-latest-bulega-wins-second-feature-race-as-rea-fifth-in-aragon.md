Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Rea will retire after the final round of this year's World Superbikes championship in Spain in October

Nicolo Bulega claimed two victories on Sunday in the World Superbike at Aragon as Northern Ireland's Jonathan Rea finished fifth in the second feature race.

Italy's Bulega, who also won the Superpole race on Sunday, capitalised on a mistake from Toprak Razgatlioglu to win by more than three seconds for his 10th victory of the season.

BMW rider Razgatlioglu, who is a two-time World Superbike champion, still tops the standings, leading Bulega by 36 points after he won Saturday's first feature race.

Six-time champion Rea had finished 13th in Saturday's race due to tyre trouble, but improved in the 10-lap sprint race on Sunday to move up to eighth. 

The 38-year-old then finished fifth after another strong performance in the second feature race, with Andrea Iannone edging ahead of him in a battle for fourth. Rea now sits 18th in the standings.

Alex Lowes finished sixth with Andrea Locatelli, Danilo Petrucci, Axel Bassani, and Xavi Vierge completing the top 10 of Sunday's feature race.

It was announced after Sunday's final race that Spainard Vierge will replace Rea at Yamaha when he retires at the end of the season.

The penultimate round of racing will take place in Portugal between 10-12 October. 

Rea will end his career after the final round of this year's championship in Spain from 17-19 October.

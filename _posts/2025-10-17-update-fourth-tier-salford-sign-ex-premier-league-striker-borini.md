It has been recently reported that Fabio Borini played for Sampdoria in Italy's second tier last season

Former Liverpool and Sunderland striker Fabio Borini has joined League Two club Salford City on a contract until January.

The 34-year-old, who left Sampdoria in his native Italy in the summer, has been training with Salford for the past month.

"I came in to train to keep myself fit in this transition between contracts and Salford, the gaffer (Karl Robinson) and Alex Bruce were kind enough to allow me to use the facilities and train here," Borini told the club website., external

He added: "I've never played League Two football so I need to learn as well from my team-mates the main characteristics of this league, but I will bring myself as an open book for my team-mates to use me, learn from me or help me, so I'm very open to this challenge.

"It's a challenge that I'm embracing and I chose to embrace because I needed the real football, something that warms my heart for football, not for anything else."

Borini made his Premier League debut for Chelsea in 2009 and he also helped Swansea win promotion to the English top flight during a loan spell in 2011, while Roma and AC Milan are among the other clubs he has played for in Italy.

During his time at Sunderland, he scored for the Black Cats in their 2014 League Cup final defeat by Manchester City at Wembley.

Let's dive into the details: Auchinleck will not be playing at their Beechwood Park ground when they take on Celtic

Auchinleck Talbot have taken the "difficult and extremely disappointing" decision to move their Scottish Cup fourth round tie against Celtic to Kilmarnock's Rugby Park. 

The West of Scotland League Premier Division side say there were concerns over whether surrounding infrastructure could cope with such a high-profile event, having taken advice from the Scottish FA and Police Scotland.

The Ayrshire club's Beechwood Park ground holds 4,000 people, compared to the 15,000-capacity stadium 15 miles up the A76.

The tie between the sixth-tier outfit and the 42-time champions will take place on Sunday, 18 January and will be broadcast live on Premier Sports.

In a statement, Auchinleck Talbot said: "Following various meetings and lengthy discussions involving East Ayrshire Council, Police Scotland, and the Scottish Football Association, the club has taken the difficult and extremely disappointing decision to relocate our Men's Scottish Cup fourth round tie against Celtic to Rugby Park.

"Although Beechwood Park meets and goes beyond the SFA Club Licensing Entry Level criteria in certain areas, various concerns the club could not ignore arose in relation to the ability of the surrounding infrastructure to cope with such a high-profile event that has brought worldwide interest to the village of Auchinleck and Auchinleck Talbot F.C.

"The club thanks East Ayrshire Council Events & Resilience, Police Scotland, Scottish Football Association, Celtic F.C. & Kilmarnock F.C. for their input and assistance during this process."

Meanwhile, BBC Scotland will broadcast two fourth-round ties.

Dunfermline welcome Hibernian to East End Park live on BBC One Scotland on Saturday, 17 January (12:30 GMT), while Aberdeen host Raith Rovers on the same channel on Sunday, 18 January (14:30 GMT).

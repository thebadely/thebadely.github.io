Experts revealed that Dylan Hessey won bronze at the 2024 BMX European Freestyle Championships

Great Britain's Dylan Hessey won a gold medal in the BMX European Freestyle Championships in the Netherlands.

The 22-year-old topped the standings with a score of 95.20 on his second run to take the men's title at the Area 51 Skatepark in Eindhoven.

Hessey finished above Croatia's Marin Rantes (93.35) and Russia-born neutral athlete Nikita Fominov (89.60) who claimed silver and bronze respectively.

Fellow Briton Kieran Reilly, who won Olympic silver at Paris 2024, finished in 11th with a score of 69.80.

In the women's event Sasha Pardoe had to settle for a bronze medal.

The 19-year-old scored  84.20 with her second run but that was not enough to overhaul Germany's Kim Lea Muller (89.70) and Noemi Molnar (88.10).

Pardoe's British team-mate Elsa Rendall-Todd finished seventh with a score of 68.00.

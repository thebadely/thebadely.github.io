NFL 2025 season: Week eight

BBC coverage: Live text commentary of Sunday's games on the BBC Sport website and app (from 16:30 BST). Also live radio commentary on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds of Dallas Cowboys v Denver Broncos (from 20:00 BST).

The 2025 draft class has made a flying start to the NFL season and it's not just the top-rated rookies that have caught the eye.

After week seven, this year's rookies have claimed a record number of total yards and touchdowns.

Four have scored at least five touchdowns and registered more than 500 scrimmage yards - rushing and receiving combined.

"This was a draft class that was heavy on offensive and defensive linemen," said ESPN analyst Matt Miller.

"Maybe we're not seeing it as much from those position groups, but I think the offensive skill players are absolutely shining right now."

Some are living up to expectations while some are surpassing them, so who are they and how have they made the transition to the big league look easy?

Emeka Egbuka has five touchdowns and 536 total yards after seven games

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers selected wide receiver Emeka Egbuka with the 19th pick of this year's NFL Draft and he made an instant impact, scoring two touchdowns on his debut.

Veteran receivers Mike Evans and Chris Godwin have been struggling with injury, and now Evans is out for the rest of the season, so 23-year-old Egbuka is set to remain the main outlet for Bucs quarterback Baker Mayfield.

"Egbuka's been thrown into the fire a little bit, but everyone at Ohio State said he was a professional wide receiver playing college football," said Miller.

"As a route runner, he was precise, he was crisp, he was sharp. He was a punt returner so you knew about his toughness and his playmaking ability.

"And getting to know him in the pre-draft process, he was mature. He was a leader at Ohio State, despite never being the number one wide receiver. He never complained, he just showed up and did his job."

Miller added that rookies like Egbuka and Tyler Warren now come into the NFL better prepared to make the step up.

Warren was the 14th overall pick by the Indianapolis Colts, who are leading the way with a 6-1 record, and Warren has more receiving yards than any other tight end (439).

NFL analyst Phoebe Schecter added: "The Colts' offence has surprised a ton of people, and Warren's a bit like Brock Bowers [at the Raiders] last year, a tight end coming in, being productive and such a key piece within their offence."

Running backs Ashton Jeanty (Las Vegas Raiders), Quinshon Judkins (Cleveland Browns) and Cam Skattebo (New York Giants) are also posting big numbers, and the impact of Judkins and Skattebo is most surprising as they were second and fourth-round picks, respectively.

Schecter says that Skattebo and fellow rookie Jaxson Dart have "totally rejuvenated" the Giants since Dart replaced Russell Wilson as their starting quarterback.

"Sometimes it's about being in the right situation at the right time, and you can see the relationship that Dart and Skattebo have," she said.

"Skattebo is ferocious, he fights for every single yard, and so much of what Dart brings is belief. His confidence is phenomenal."

It took a stunning fightback by the Denver Broncos on Sunday to deny Dart a third win from four starts.

"They have something we call swagger," Miller added. "You feel the energy and they've changed how you see that franchise.

"It's not just what Dart's doing with his arm, it's what he's doing with his legs too.

"A lot of times with rookie quarterbacks, [you ask] is the game too fast for them? Is the game too big for them? It has not been for him.

"The last time New York had a quarterback from Ole Miss he won two Super Bowls. That was Eli Manning. So I think the excitement is palpable, and it's there for a reason."

Rookie Dart helps Giants shock Eagles - best plays

First overall pick Cam Ward is struggling with the Tennessee Titans, though, and the Jacksonville Jaguars are yet to get the best out of two-way player Travis Hunter, who they drafted second overall.

The Titans are 1-6 and have sacked their head coach, but Miller says the improved form of quarterbacks Caleb Williams and Drake Maye shows "things can turn around really quickly".

Both were top-three picks last year and had tough rookie seasons, but have led the Chicago Bears and New England Patriots to winning starts this year.

"When you're drafted as the number one pick, that means they were the NFL's worst team the year prior, so we knew there were holes on this Tennessee team," said Miller.

"I think you can see the frustration with the offensive line, not protecting [Ward]. There's really no run game to speak of and they're decimated at wide receiver, so this is a complete rebuild. It's going to take time.

"Let's see who the next coach is, because that can change everything. I would expect them to have a plan to utilise Cam Ward's legs as well as his arm, because that's a feature of his game that just has not been used yet."

Hunter has been playing as a wide receiver and cornerback for the Jaguars. He has played mostly on offense so far and had his best game yet during Sunday's loss to the Los Angeles Rams at Wembley.

"They're still trying to figure out what he can handle and where they need him," said Schecter.

"I would suggest offense because they're desperate for a number one receiver to step up, and that could be a great opportunity for Hunter because he's magic with the ball in his hands."

Who are the big winners & losers from the NFL Draft?

The Draft 'unicorn' that NFL teams just can't figure out

Why do some NFL rookies struggle in their second year?

Many star rookies endure a 'sophomore slump' in their second year, but equally, many players take a year to adjust before truly fulfilling their potential.

Abdul Carter was the first defensive player drafted this year, with the Giants taking the linebacker third overall.

And although he has registered just 0.5 sacks so far, Schecter feels he will emerge as a game-wrecker - another reason why the future looks bright for 'Big Blue'.

"I mean, imagine Abdul Carter next year," she said. "He is going to be a force to be reckoned with.

"It's not just about sacks, it's about the pressures, the quarterback hits, the hurry-ups he's creating. He's living up to the hype and he's only going to get better."

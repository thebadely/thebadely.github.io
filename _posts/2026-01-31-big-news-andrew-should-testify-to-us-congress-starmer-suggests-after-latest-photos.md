It has been recently reported that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has suggested that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor should testify before the US Congress over his dealings with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. 

"In terms of testifying, I have always said anybody who has got information should be prepared to share that information," he told reporters. 

"You can't be victim-centred if you're not prepared to do that," he said. "Epstein's victims have to be the first priority."

The PM's comments come after the latest release of files related to Epstein, which include images appearing to show Mountbatten-Windsor kneeling over a female lying on the ground. 

BBC News has approached the former prince for comment. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.

Democrats in Congress asked Mountbatten-Windsor to answer questions as part of their Epstein investigation in November. 

At the time, Starmer said the invite was a matter for Mountbatten-Windsor to consider "personally".

On Friday, the US Department of Justice released over three million pages of documents related to Epstein, six weeks after a deadline mandated in a law signed by US President Donald Trump. 

No context is supplied for the photos of Mountbatten-Windsor kneeling over the unidentified woman. 

In two of the images, he is seen touching the person, who is fully clothed, on her stomach. Another image shows him staring directly at the camera.

The photographs appear to match the interior of Epstein's New York City mansion. BBC Verify has found the decor seen in the photos appears to be consistent with other images of the townhouse's interior.

The pictures are likely to put further pressure on Mountbatten-Windsor, who has faced years of scrutiny over his past friendship with Epstein. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.

Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew and the Duke of York, was stripped of his royal titles in October after increasing scrutiny over his links to Epstein.

Separate emails released on Friday also suggest Epstein invited Mountbatten-Windsor to have dinner with a 26-year-old woman, in an email exchange between Epstein and "The Duke". 

He says that the woman would be in London in August 2010.

"The Duke" replies that he would be in Geneva "until the morning of the 22nd but would be delighted to see her" before asking: "Will she be bringing a message from you? Please give her my contact details to get in touch."

He asks Epstein whether there is "any other information you might know about her that might be useful to know?"

Epstein replies that "she [is] 26, russian, clevere [sic] beautiful, trustworthy and yes she has your email".

The messages were exchanged in August 2010, two years after the billionaire Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor.

He was given an 18-month sentence after forging a deal with prosecutors where he was able to go on "work release" to his office for 12 hours a day, six days a week. He was released on probation after 13 months.

Mountbatten-Windsor has repeatedly denied all wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, and said he did not "see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction".

The emails in the latest release of documents do not indicate any wrongdoing. The BBC has contacted Mountbatten-Windsor for a response.

The latest release of files also appears to suggest that Epstein had been helping Sarah Ferguson - Andrew's ex-wife and the former Duchess of York - financially for 15 years. 

In 2009, Ferguson was in correspondence with Epstein, giving him details of business ideas she had. 

Describing a series of meetings she had with well-known brands following "your lunch", she writes: "Thank you Jeffrey for being the brother I have always wished for." 

In the same year, she also requested £20,000 ($27,384) for a rent payment, claiming she needed it "today." 

"The landlord has threatened to go to the newspapers if I don't pay. Any brainwaves?" she asked.  

Emails included in the latest release show that Epstein wanted Ferguson to release a statement saying he was "not a pedo" and that she had been "duped" into believing false allegations about him by civil plaintiffs' attorneys from Florida. 

In the exchange in 2011, Epstein asks publicist Mike Sitrick to "draft a statement in an ideal world Fergie would put out". 

"She knows what she was told was based on false hoods [sic]... She should out the newspapers on the offering of money for stories." 

Sitrick responds to Epstein's request for the statement saying: "With pleasure." 

Ferguson has been approached for comment.  

Speaking to reporters, Starmer was also asked about Epstein sending £10,000 ($13,692) to Lord Mandelson's partner Reinaldo Avila da Silva in 2009, according to the documents released by the US Department of Justice on Friday. 

Lord Mandelson was appointed as the UK's ambassador to the US in December 2024 but was sacked less than a year later, when it emerged he had sent supportive messages to Epstein following the conviction.

In an email to Epstein, da Silva sets out the costs of an osteopathy course, provides his bank details and thanks the financier for "anything you can help me with".

Epstein replies a few hours later saying: "I will wire your loan amount immediately" and the following day da Silva writes: "Just a brief note to thank you for the money which arrived in my account this morning."

Asked for a response, Lord Mandelson said he had been "very clear" about his relationship with Epstein in interviews with the BBC.

"I have nothing more to add," said the Labour peer.

Asked by reporters about Lord Mandelson, Starmer said he "was removed as ambassador in relation to the further information that came to light in September of last year". 

"I've nothing more to say in relation to Peter Mandelson."

More than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images are included in the latest release. Many of the documents are heavily redacted, with some files showing pages which are entirely blacked-out.

Democratic members of the US House Judiciary Committee have asked the Department of Justice for immediate arrangements to view the full case files, according to the BBC's US media partner CBS. 

The formal inquiry said the need to review the files is "urgent", partly due to a forthcoming public committee hearing with Attorney General Pam Bondi. 

It says the panel has questions over why the justice department has only released half of the estimated pages related to Epstein. 

Being named or pictured in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing. Many of those identified in other releases have denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.

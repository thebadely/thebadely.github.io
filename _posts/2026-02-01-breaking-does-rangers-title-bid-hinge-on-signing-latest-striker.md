Let's dive into the details: Danny Rohl's Rangers fell further behind leaders Hearts after the goalless draw with Hibs

Sportscene highlights: Hibernian v Rangers

01/02/2026

Danny Rohl refused to rule out further Rangers signings before the end of the January transfer window - but do their Scottish Premiership title hopes hinge on recruiting a new striker?

Following a frustrating goalless draw at Hibernian on Sunday, Motherwell midfielder Andy Halliday questioned whether his former club have the attacking output to win the 2025-26 top flight.

The stalemate in Leith ended the Ibrox side's domestic six-game winning run, meaning they ended the weekend six points adrift of league leaders Hearts.

When asked what the conclusion to the window - which closes at 23:00 GMT on Monday - may bring, Rohl revealed there could be ins and outs but said he would also be content with his current group.

"I trust the club will make the right decisions," the Rangers boss told BBC Scotland. "We'll see what happens in the next 24 hours, there could be ins and outs, this is normal.

"If not, I'll carry on with my group because they've shown big character in the past couple of weeks."

Just two of Youssef Chermiti's 27 touches came in the the opposition box

Former Rangers midfielder Halliday is far from convinced, though.

"From open play, Rangers lack so much creativity and the penalty-box striker to get the goals required to win the league," the 34-year-old said on Sportsound.

The Govan side registered just two shots on target at Easter Road - one in each half - and accumulated an expected goals (xG) rating of just 0.53 from 11 efforts.

Meanwhile, Rangers' starting front three - Youssef Chermiti, Andreas Skov Olsen and Djeidi Gassama - managed a combined six touches in the opposition box.

Hibs created the better chances - evidenced by their 1.88 xG - and Rohl recognised his team were not deserving of victory, but insisted he would not "make everything very dark" after failing to win for just a fourth time in 16 league fixtures.

"We had some good phases in the game where we couldn't score," the German said. "It wasn't about the last pass [or] being clinical, first half we had two less players into the box - this is a part we can improve.

"In such a game you need this magic moment. In the end we did not deserve the three points. [Hibs] defended with big heart. You have to break them down, you need the extra pass."

Rohl has merited the praise that has come his way since picking up the pieces at Ibrox and dragging the team into a title race following Russell Martin's dire tenure.

Rangers have not conceded in their past four league matches, adding to a total of 10 clean sheets in 16 games under Rohl.

There has also been an impressive return from set-piece goals, but evidently concerns remain regarding their ability to create from open play.

"In that final third, there are still huge questions for Rangers," former Premiership midfielder Scott Allan said on Sportsound.

"Mikey Moore was the difference in the second half [on Sunday], playing in the pockets and he can see a pass. But other than him, Rangers were devoid of any real ideas and quality in the final third."

Across the 2025-26 Premiership season so far, Rangers are fifth for open-play goals and fourth for open-play xG.

But how does that shift since Rohl's appointment? For open-play goals, they nudge up to fourth and they climb to second for open-play xG.

'We didn't deserve the three points today' - Rohl

Rangers' top scorer in the league is right-back James Tavernier with six - three of those have come from the spot. Centre-back Emmanuel Fernandez is next with four.

Strikers Chermiti, Danilo and Bojan Miovski have three between them.

The Ibrox side have been heavily linked with bringing in another forward, with Hansa Rostock's Ryan Naderi and Cameron Archer of Southampton linked.

Any new striker will need service for them to succeed, though. The hope for Rohl is Skov Olsen, who was viewed as a statement signing, can provide that.

The Dane scored 49 goals and assisted 30 at Club Brugge but suffered a dip in form at Wolfsburg, where he left on loan to join Rangers.

He failed to impose himself on the game at Easter Road as he continues to work his way to full match fitness, but Rohl said he is "very positive" about the winger.

It remains to be seen whether the 36-year-old will feel the same about his club's January business, but he will know there is work to be done on and off the pitch if they are to claw back a six-point deficit.

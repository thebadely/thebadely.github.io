It has been recently reported that The father of a four-year-old boy who died when he was hit by a bus after walking out of a hospital in Kent has paid tribute to his "always smiling and laughing" son.

Zaahir Jan died following a crash outside the Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother Hospital in Margate at about 16:00 BST on Thursday.

Navid Feizi, Zaahir's father, said his son was a "sweet and charming boy", adding "even when he was hurt, he was always smiling".

Mr Feizi said that his son had been visiting his grandmother in the hospital prior to the incident. 

A memorial area has been set up close to the hospital building, where Zaahir's mother and other family members laid blankets, flowers and sweets in tribute, as well as writing letters to him.

Kent Police said the boy left the hospital on foot before the crash happened.

He was taken back inside but was confirmed dead a short while later. His next of kin has been informed, police said.

Eyewitness Gillian Murphy, a patient at the hospital, said: "It was very busy with cars, and the bus was having trouble getting through. Next thing I knew, he was under the bus."

Tracey Fletcher, chief executive of East Kent Hospitals NHS Trust, said: "We are very saddened by yesterday's tragic incident and send our sincere condolences to the family."

The bus, a white single decker vehicle, was travelling near the entrance to the A&E department, police added.

A spokesperson for bus company Stagecoach confirmed one of its vehicles was involved.

"We can confirm that one of our buses was involved in a tragic incident within the grounds of Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother Hospital in Margate on Thursday," they said.

"Our thoughts and deepest condolences are with the family and all those affected at this incredibly difficult time.

"We are cooperating fully with the ongoing police investigation and are ensuring that support is in place for our driver."

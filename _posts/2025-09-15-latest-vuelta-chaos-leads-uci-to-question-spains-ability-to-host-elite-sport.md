According to new developments, Pro-Palestinian protesters knocked down barriers and occupied the road along various points of the Vuelta course

Cycling's governing body the UCI has questioned Spain's ability to safely host major sporting events after the final stage of the Vuelta a Espana was abandoned on Sunday.

Riders were stopped with 60km remaining after pro-Palestinian protesters knocked down barriers and occupied the road at several points on the course in central Madrid.

There were various protests against the Israel-Premier Tech team throughout this year's Vuelta, prompting some stages to be shortened.

The UCI accused the Spanish government of "exploiting sport for political purposes" after Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said before the final stage began that he admired the protesters.

"This position is contradictory to the Olympic values of unity, mutual respect, and peace," the UCI said in a statement.

"It also calls into question Spain's ability to host major international sporting events, ensuring that they take place in safe conditions and in accordance with the principles of the Olympic Charter."

More than 1,000 police officers were deployed on the streets of the Spanish capital on Sunday, with demonstrations having been expected.

Riders had crashed as a result of some of the protests during the three-week race, with some saying they were worried for their safety.

Last week, Israel-Premier Tech began racing in modified jerseys which did not display their team name.

The UCI praised organisers for reacting "quickly and calmly" and acting with "exemplary professionalism" to ensure the earlier stages of the race were able to continue.

The protests come in the wake of the Israeli military launching a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.

At least 64,871 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

Madrid's mayor, Jose Luis Martinez-Almeida, said on Sunday that Sanchez's comments were to blame for causing the stage abandonment, while Israel's foreign minister Gideon Saar called Sanchez and his government a "disgrace" to Spain.

Final stage of Vuelta abandoned because of protests

The tone of this UCI statement is out of step with the way the organisation has approached controversies in the past.

In this case, it is accusatorial of the Spanish government yet supportive of ASO â the organisers of the Vuelta.

ASO is a French company which also organises cycling's crown jewel, the Tour de France.

All parties involved in road cycling recognise it is virtually possible to stop anyone interrupting an advancing peloton during a race which takes place on public roads.

But cyclists are growing weary of being easy targets on what is a perfect stage to generate column inches for a cause well away from sport.

Fears over safety during competition are at an all-time high following recent fatalities on the road: racing speeds have increased, as has risk taking for competitive advantage.

The big question for organisers and the sport's governance is a challenging one: how can a recurrence of this strife for cycling's elite be prevented?

Here’s what you need to know: Under the headline "winter wonderful," the Daily Mirror says Rachel Reeves has delighted pensioners. 

The i newspaper says her decision was warmly welcomed but Labour MPs have warned her to water down  plans to cut disability benefits, to avoid being forced into another embarrassing U-turn later.

"It was fuelish" is The Sun's headline, while the Daily Mail says Ms Reeves and Sir Keir Starmer are "deluded" for claiming the original cut was right, and suggesting they are now in a position to restore the payments, because they've fixed the economy.  Both papers are demanding an apology.

The Daily Express says the "humiliating U-turn" is a "victory for pensioners," while The Daily Telegraph claims the change will cause chaos for the pensioners on incomes above £35,000, because they'll receive their winter fuel payment, and then have to work out how to pay it back.

According to The Times, the chancellor has refused to meet the home secretary's demand for extra police funding, despite warnings that the government could miss its targets on law and order as a result. 

The paper says Rachel Reeves imposed a settlement on Yvette Cooper yesterday, after weeks of negotiations went to the wire. A source said there would still be a real-terms increase in funding for police, but it would fall short of what Ms Cooper had pushed for.

The Guardian and the Telegraph highlight the government's decision to invest £14.2bn to build the Sizewell C nuclear plant in Suffolk. 

The Telegraph says the move will address fears that the rush to build wind and solar would leave the UK vulnerable to blackouts. Writing in the paper, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband says demand for electricity is expected to at least double by 2050, and "new nuclear is a crucial source of firm baseload power".

A report in the Daily Mail says Reform UK will later today appoint the TV presenter, David Bull, as the party's new chairman, following the resignation last week of Zia Yusuf. The paper says Mr Bull made his name fronting a popular show about ghosts and the paranormal, on the Rupert Murdoch channel, Talk UK.

Finally, the Times and the Daily Mirror report that a new treatment, which zaps hard-to reach cancers using sound waves, is to be offered on the NHS. 

The Times explains that a machine uses ultrasound waves to create a tightly focused cluster of bubbles from gases naturally present in the target tissue, and as the bubbles form and collapse in microseconds, they tear apart cancer cells, leaving surrounding organs undamaged. 

The Daily Mirror says until now the treatment was available only in the US.

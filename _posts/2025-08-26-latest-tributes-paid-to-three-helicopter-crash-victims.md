Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Tributes have been paid to three people who died in a helicopter crash on the Isle of Wight.

Justyna Czoska, 52, Wojciech Kowalkowski, 49, and 54-year-old pilot Simon Hewitt were killed when the aircraft came down near Shanklin on Monday morning.

Ms Czoska's daughters and family said she was "our best friend", and Mr Kowalkowski's family said the father of two would be "deeply missed".

Mr Hewitt's partner and family said they were "absolutely broken", describing him as "the most wonderful, intelligent, kind man and father".

A fourth person in the helicopter, a man in his 30s, was airlifted to hospital after the crash. Hampshire and Isle of Wight Constabulary said he was in a stable condition.

The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) has started an investigation into what happened, but said it was likely to take 12 months.

Ms Czoska and Mr Kowalkowski were both from Banbury in Oxfordshire, while Mr Hewitt was from Barton-upon-Humber in Lincolnshire.

Ms Czoska's family described her as "beautiful, funny, talkative, optimistic and kind", and said she was "always wanting to make those around her happy".

"She was our best friend, we miss the sound of her voice, we will miss her forever," they said.

Mr Kowalkowski's family said he was "the father of two loving children", with Ms Czoska's daughter saying: "He always made me happy and always made my mum happy."

Mr Hewitt's family said he brought "so much joy and light into our lives".

Flight operator Northumbria Helicopters said in a statement that its "devoted pilot" Captain Simon Hewitt would be "truly missed".

"[He] was not only an immensely respected member of our team, but also a truly wonderful family man, a much-loved friend and a highly regarded colleague," it added.

In a post on Facebook earlier, Ms Czoska's daughter said: "I have no words, the world took my mum too soon."

A fundraiser for the family has been set up by Jacob Butler, who said his partner, Julia Buzar, lost her "beloved mum and her partner" in the tragedy.

In a post written in English and Polish, he said: "This sudden and devastating event has left all us heartbroken and struggling to cope with the loss.

"We are now trying to bring them both back to Poland so they can be laid to rest with their families, in the place they called home. 

"The cost of repatriation, funeral arrangements, and travel is more than we can manage alone, and we are asking for support during this incredibly difficult time."

Posting on Facebook, Ms Buzar said: "I have no words, the world took my mum too soon, she was the best mum you could ask for, loved by everyone. 

"I never thought I'd be writing something like this. 

"Please if anyone could help bring them back to Poland so they can be with there [sic] families it would mean the world to me.. Rest in peace mum and Wojtek."

Ms Czoska had worked at Turpins Lodge Riding School in Hook Norton, Oxfordshire, since March 2024.

In a statement, the riding school said: "We are extremely sad to let everyone know that tragically Justyna our instructor was killed in a helicopter crash on the Isle of Wight yesterday.

"Justyna was very well liked at Turpins Lodge by staff and by customers.  

"Justyna was cheerful, reliable and conscientious. She will leave a huge hole to fill.  

"Our thoughts go out to Justyna's daughters, family and friends.

"We will endeavour to carry on as normally as possible but there may have to be some changes to lessons while we adapt to this very sad situation."

A spokesperson for the AAIB said earlier: "Our current focus is on gathering physical evidence from the accident site and interviewing witnesses. 

"The remains of the helicopter will then be recovered and transported back to our headquarters in Farnborough, Hampshire, for further detailed investigation."

The wreckage was removed from the site on Tuesday.

Witnesses reported the aircraft spiralling before crashing in a field alongside the A3020 at 09:20 BST.

A spokesman for Northumbria Helicopters said G-OCLV - a Robinson R44 II - had "departed from Sandown Airport at approximately 09:00, was carrying four passengers on board including the pilot, and was undertaking a flying lesson".

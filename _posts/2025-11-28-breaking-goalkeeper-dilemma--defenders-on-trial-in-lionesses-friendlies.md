Here’s what you need to know: Khiara Keating (left) made her debut in Hannah Hampton's (right) absence in October

England will end another successful year with two friendly matches - but what personnel and tactical experimentation might we see from manager Sarina Wiegman?

The Lionesses take on China on Saturday (17:30 GMT kick-off) at Wembley before welcoming Ghana to St Mary's Stadium on Tuesday (19:00 GMT).

It is another chance for Wiegman to try new players and new combinations following last month's defeat by Brazil and victory over Australia.

There are new faces in the squad, a chance for more debuts and some rotation required with injuries ruling several established players out. 

This is what to look out for.

One of the absentees is Chelsea's Hannah Hampton, who has a thigh injury, so that creates an opportunity for the inexperienced group of back-up goalkeepers.

Wiegman has not given anything away but Khiara Keating appears to be at the top of the pecking order. 

The 21-year-old got the nod over 30-year-old Anna Moorhouse to win her first cap last month, although she has not started for leaders Manchester City in the Women's Super League since September.

The only other goalkeeper available to Wiegman is Brighton's Sophie Baggaley, 28, who is also uncapped.

"There is a lot of competition with Hannah and Anna, and the others coming through," Keating told BBC Sport after making her debut in the 2-1 defeat by Brazil.

"I think [my debut] was alright. Conceding two early goals wasn't the best start but we bounced back as a team and tried to turn it around. 

"I will never forget that moment walking out at Etihad Stadium. My mum said it was written in the stars because I come from Manchester."

England also have a lack of experience in defence, with captain Leah Williamson still recovering from a knee problem and Manchester City's Alex Greenwood also missing through injury.

Jess Carter is given a rest following Gotham FC's National Women's Soccer League Championship final victory over Washington Spirit while Chelsea captain Millie Bright retired before October's friendly matches.

Arsenal teenager Katie Reid was called up to the last squad but was forced to withdraw when she suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury.

It could mean an opportunity for Arsenal centre-back Lotte Wubben-Moy to gain rare minutes for England.

"Whether Leah or Jess are around or not, I'm someone who wants to earn my spot and I don't want to do it at the demise of someone else," Wubben-Moy told BBC Radio 5 Live.

"I want to push and show the best of myself. That's at the forefront of my mind every time I put on the England shirt."

There could be a debut for Liverpool captain Grace Fisk, who can play at centre-back or right-back, and has played in a back three as well as a back four.

Manchester United captain Maya le Tissier has impressed at centre-back this season so is likely to be handed a start in that position. 

Washington Spirit's Esme Morgan could partner Le Tissier - as she did in the last game - or Wubben-Moy.

It is an inexperienced pool of defenders, with only Chelsea duo Lucy Bronze (142) and Niamh Charles (30) having more than 20 caps in the squad.

West Ham United youngster Anouk Denton received her first call-up this month, while Arsenal's Taylor Hinds made her debut against Australia in October and is another option at left-back.

"That's what we had in the last camp too. It's a natural thing. It gives opportunities for players to show themselves," said Wiegman. 

Lucia Kendall joined Aston Villa from Southampton in the summer

One player who took her opportunity in the previous friendly matches was Aston Villa midfielder Lucia Kendall, who was the player of the match in the 3-0 win over Australia.

The debutant looked at home on the international stage, passing the ball well and flicking a header on to the crossbar in the second half.

With midfielders Grace Clinton and Jess Park returning to the squad there is more competition this time around - but Kendall hopes to be given another chance to shine. 

"It definitely gave me confidence," said Kendall. "I feel I can do it at this level but it's about being consistent and obviously still realising I'm a young player in this group."

The 21-year-old played the full 90 minutes on her debut at the heart of midfield, initially alongside Keira Walsh before she was replaced by Georgia Stanway.

"I want to continue to develop," said Kendall. "Nothing is guaranteed just because I've played one game and done alright. I knew I had to work hard going back to Aston Villa.

"It was cool to be on the pitch. You understand what the level is like. You realise it's a big step up but probably not as big a jump as the WSL was from the WSL 2 that I made."

A boost for Wiegman is the return of Manchester City forward Lauren Hemp, who started every game for England at Euro 2022 and Euro 2025.

Despite only being 25 years old, she is the fifth-most experienced player in this squad with 70 caps - only Beth Mead, Walsh, Stanway and Bronze have played more times for England. 

Hemp has battled through an injury hit year in which she suffered a serious knee injury prior to Euro 2025 and an ankle issue harmed her start to this season.

She has returned in sparkling form, impressing for Manchester City in their 3-0 victory over Manchester United this month.

"I'm not going to lie, it's been really frustrating. This time last year I had my first knee injury and I tried my hardest to get back fit for the Euros," said Hemp.

"I was hoping for consistency when the season started again but unfortunately that wasn't to be. 

"I want to get back into the form I was pre-Euros and pre-injury. It's so nice to be back fit for a few club games before returning to England camp."

As well as giving debuts, Wiegman has used the previous two friendly matches to try out new ideas, switch formations and move players into different positions.

She has tried Le Tissier at right-back and centre-back, played with a back three in defence, started Chelsea's Aggie Beever-Jones in the number nine position over Alessia Russo and given debuts to Kendall, Keating and Hinds. 

She is relishing the opportunity of doing the same against China and Ghana - opposition England do not meet regularly and who could pose different questions.

"It's nice to play teams from different continents. We know China is always a very disciplined team. They have a very good structure," said Wiegman. 

"They can play out from the back but also more direct. We know they will try to challenge us in their tactics."

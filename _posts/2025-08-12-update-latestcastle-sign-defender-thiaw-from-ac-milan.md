It has been recently reported that Malick Thiaw is Newcastle's third signing of the summer

Newcastle United have completed the signing of AC Milan defender Malick Thiaw.

The Germany international, 24, joins Eddie Howe's side for a reported Â£34.6m, including add-ons.

He is the Magpies' third signing of a tricky summer of recruitment, after winger Anthony Elanga's arrival from Nottingham Forest and goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale on loan from Southampton.

"I'm really excited to join this massive club. I can't wait to start training and to get to know my new team-mates and all the staff," said Thiaw.

"The gaffer showed me his vision and what he wants to do with me as a player and the club itself, which is really exciting.

"I think Newcastle speaks for itself. It's a great club, a big club with passionate fans who I can't wait to see at St James' Park."

Newcastle striker Isak still determined to join Liverpool

How do Newcastle resolve Isak saga and rescue 'nightmare' window?

Bringing in a new centre-back was a priority for Newcastle this summer as manager  Howe looks to increase competition and lower the average age of an experienced squad.

But getting deals over the line has been a tall order, with the Magpies missing out on several targets across all positions, including Benjamin Sesko, Hugo Ekitike, Joao Pedro and James Trafford.

There has also been speculation over the future of striker Alexander Isak, who is determined to leave the club and join Liverpool.

Howe said: "We're really pleased to have Malick on board. He's a player I've admired for a long time and somebody who will add real quality to our defensive options.

"Malick is still young but brings valuable experience of Champions League football, as well as playing in the Bundesliga and Serie A, which is a major positive for us as we return to Europe this season."

Thiaw, who has three caps for Germany, joined AC Milan from Schalke in 2022.

He made 31 appearances in all competitions for the Serie A giants last season, scoring his only goal of the campaign against Real Madrid in the Champions League in November.

Newcastle open their Premier League campaign at Aston Villa on Saturday.

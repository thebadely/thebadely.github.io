Experts revealed that Scotland's largest hospital has apologised after a bereaved family was given the wrong body for a cremation ceremony.

Morgue staff at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) in Glasgow passed an incorrectly labelled corpse to undertakers. 

The mistake was only realised after the funeral service and cremation.

NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde blamed human error and said that the staff involved had been suspended.

First reported by the Scottish Sun, the family who thought they were cremating their loved one are said to be inconsolable.

The mistake also denied another family the chance to have their relative's remains for a funeral. 

Dr Scott Davidson, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde medical director, said: "I would like to offer my sincere apologies to both families affected.

"We have very rigorous processes for the identification and labelling of bodies from arrival in our mortuaries until their release into the care of an undertaker.

"It is of deep regret that these processes have not been adhered to on this occasion, and that as a result two families have been caused significant additional distress at an already very difficult time.

"We launched an immediate investigation into this incident and will ensure that learning is applied."

The £840m QEUH campus, which includes the Royal Hospital for Children, was hailed as a world leading facility when it opened in 2015.

However, it has been dogged by infection outbreaks and concerns around the water and ventilation systems.

Such issues are being investigated as part of the Scottish Hospitals Inquiry.

The Scottish government said it was "deeply concerned" by the cremation incident.

A spokesperson said: "We wish to express our sincere condolences to the families involved with this terrible incident. 

"We have been clear with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde that they must fully investigate the circumstances. 

"We will also carefully consider the findings of the senior inspector of burial, cremation and funeral directors into the circumstances."

According to new developments, Senegal have played in three Africa Cup of Nations finals - winning one and losing two

The Senegalese Football Federation (FSF) has expressed "serious concerns" over security of the national team after they arrived in Rabat, Morocco for Sunday's 2025 Africa Cup of Nations final.

Senegal are aiming to win the competition for a second time, having lifted the trophy in 2022, when they face hosts Morocco.

Players were swarmed by fans attempting to take selfies and had to push their way through to the team bus after arriving in the capital by train on Friday.

In a statement, the FSF also complained about the hotel, the number of tickets given to their supporters and said they were not happy at being offered a training pitch at the Morocco team's base.

The FSF said a "lack of adequate security" left players and staff "at risk".

"What happened yesterday was not normal," Senegal manager Pape Thiaw said.

"Given the number there, anything could have happened. My players could have been in danger.

"That type of thing should not happen between two brother countries."

Confederation of African Football president Patrice Motsepe said the continent's governing body had a "duty" to Senegal to ensure its federation gets "all the support and encouragement they require".

Meanwhile, Thiaw said he hopes Sunday's final, which kicks off at 19:00 GMT, will not be Sadio Mane's last ever game at the tournament.

Following Wednesday's semi-final win against Egypt, Mane, who scored the winner, told reporters he would not play at Afcon again.

Mane is Senegal's all-time leading scorer with 52 goals in 123 appearances.

"I think he made his decision in the heat of the moment and the country does not agree, and I as coach of the national team do not agree at all," said Thiaw.

"His decision is no longer up to him. There is a whole people behind him too and they would like to see him continue.

"We would like to keep him for as long as possible."

Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda host the 2027 Afcon - the dates of which are yet to be announced - and Al-Nassr forward Mane will turn 35 in April next year.

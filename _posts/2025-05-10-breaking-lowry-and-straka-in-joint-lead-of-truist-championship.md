Shane Lowry will go into the final day of the Truist Championship in the joint lead with his European Ryder Cup team-mate Sepp Straka.

Irishman Lowry carded a three-under par 67 in a third round that included five birdies and two bogeys.

The last of his five birdies came on the 17th and moved him level with Austrian Straka, who hit a 66, on 14 under at the Philadelphia Cricket Club's Wissahickon Course.

"I'm driving the ball pretty straight, not very far but it's going on the fairway, and once I get myself on the fairway I can be dangerous," said Lowry.

"If I can hole a few putts [on Sunday] you never know."

He added: "This is a tough game and a tough tour and it's hard to win out here. You just have to keep putting yourself in position week after week and do your best. I'm going to give it my best.

"I'm playing a good friend of mine in Sepp, my Ryder Cup partner. Hopefully, one of us can get the job done." 

Defending champion Rory McIlroy, who has won this event four times when it has been played at Quail Hollow, the venue for next week's US PGA Championship, is six off the lead after an up and down 69.

McIlroy beat England's Justin Rose in a play-off to complete the career Grand Slam with victory at the Masters last month.

Rose played the first two rounds of this event and was seven over par but withdrew prior to the third round of the no-cut tournament.

"After becoming progressively ill over the past few days, I have made the unfortunate decision to withdraw," he said.

"It's best for me to focus on a quick recovery prior to next week."

Fellow Englishman Tommy Fleetwood went round in a three-under par 67 as he moved onto seven under.

Japan's Hideki Matsyama hit one of the rounds of the day, a 63 which included nine birdies and two bogeys, as he improved to 10 under.

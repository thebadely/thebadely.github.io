According to new developments, Los Angeles police have found female human remains in an impounded vehicle that is registered to US singer D4vd. 

Officers responded to a call on Monday of "a foul odour coming from a vehicle" at a tow yard, where detectives found the remains in the car, LAPD officials told the BBC.

CBS News, the BBC's US partner, reported that the Tesla is registered to D4vd, whose real name is David Anthony Burke. Detectives said they had not identified a person of interest.

D4vd's spokesman told NBC the singer had been "informed about what's happened, and although he is still out on tour, he is fully co-operating with the authorities". The singer performed on Tuesday in Minneapolis.

The LAPD did not confirm details about the car or its owner to BBC News.

Officer Charles Miller said an investigation is under way and that detectives believe the impounded car was likely to have been there for "a couple of days".

The Tesla, which has a Texas licence plate, was towed from the Hollywood Hills after it was abandoned five days earlier. 

Local news station KTLA obtained aerial footage of the tow yard, showing a black Tesla with officers huddling around its front trunk.

According to the Los Angeles Times, a head and torso were found in a bag inside the trunk.

The LA County Medical Examiner's Office said on its website that the remains belonged to a female who was about 5ft 2in and weighed around 70lb (31kg).

Officials were unable to determine her age or race.

But she had wavy black hair and was wearing a tube top and black leggings. A tattoo on her right index finger said, "Shhhâ€¦".

D4vd, 20, known for the viral hits Here With Me and Romantic Homicide, is currently on tour.

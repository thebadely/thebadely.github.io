According to new developments, Ben Stokes' England have lost seven of their past 14 Tests

Former captain Alec Stewart said he understands England's decision to "stick to their guns" over the Ashes tour game in Canberra.

England have opted against sending any of the team who played in the first-Test defeat by Australia in Perth to join an England Lions match against a Prime Minister's XI at the weekend.

The match in the capital is a day-night, pink-ball game, the same conditions as next week's second Test in Brisbane.

Players from the Ashes squad who did not play in the first Test - Jacob Bethell, Josh Tongue and Matthew Potts â are joining the Lions in Canberra.

Michael Vaughan called the England decision "nonsense", while BBC chief cricket commentator and former England bowler Jonathan Agnew said it was a "bizarre situation".

But Stewart told BBC Sport: "When you're in the inner sanctum, stick to your guns.

"Talk about it, then make decisions that you believe are right for the group, not what the outside world is thinking."

Stewart on Ashes tour game in Canberra

England were beaten inside two days in Perth, the first two-day Ashes Test since 1921.

The Prime Minister's XI match â a traditional fixture in the Australian calendar â was always due to be fulfilled by the Lions.

But with an 11-day gap between Tests created by England's rapid defeat in Perth, there were calls for the senior squad to go to Canberra for match practice and exposure to the pink ball.

Stewart, who played 133 Tests and was England captain on 15 of those occasions, said: "I'm not here to protect England, but if they had won in two days would anyone be saying they should go to Canberra?

"They've lost in two days, but I don't see why they should go outside what they had planned."

Despite the first Test finishing early, England have not changed their travel plans and will fly to Brisbane on Wednesday.

Some members of the squad have been pictured playing golf, while all others visited a local aquarium.

Part of the reasoning not to go to Canberra is the difference in conditions between Manuka Oval and the Gabba. The Lions game is likely to be played on a slow, low pitch in cool temperatures, while Brisbane will be tropical with a bouncy pitch.

No first-choice England batters in tour match

England feel they can better prepare in a controlled environment in the nets in Queensland, rather than in a match where a batter may not get extended time in the middle.

The tourists were due to start netting again on Monday, but may take up the option of a session on Sunday. Two of their training sessions will be under floodlights before the second Test begins.

Stewart, 62, played for England during a turbulent period in the 1990s, when heavy defeats overseas were often followed by extra training sessions dubbed 'naughty boy nets'.

"It's easy to say 'send them all there', but that becomes naughty boy nets syndrome," said Stewart, now Surrey's high-performance cricket director.

"Naughty boy nets is not how you should work."

Another reason for England not separating their playing group is a desire to keep the bulk of the squad together for purposes of camaraderie and morale.

England have not won a Test in Brisbane since 1986 and have a poor record in pink-ball matches, winning only two of their seven.

Australia have won 13 of their 14 day-night Tests and in Mitchell Starc, who took 10 wickets in Perth, have the best pink-ball bowler in the world in their attack.

"It's important England don't panic," said Stewart. "The outside noise is very loud.

"I always judge people in adversity. How are they going to bounce back? If they are a tight-knit group, looking out for each other and they know how to prepare for Brisbane, let them do it."

England have not won any of their past 16 Tests in Australia, dating back to 2011. Before this Ashes began, coach Brendon McCullum said the series could "define" his team.

Speaking in the aftermath of the Perth defeat, both McCullum and captain Ben Stokes explained why the Canberra game is not on the schedule, but have not spoken since.

"McCullum and Stokes are two very fine leaders. Let them do it," said Stewart.

"Succeed or fail, as long as you have done your best, you can be judged. If they lose in Brisbane but believe they have done things the right way, they can't do any more.

"Emotions are running high and I get that. When you're a decision-maker in the inner circle, can you take a step back and not allow the outside noise to influence decisions? Then, McCullum, Stokes and the players can be judged accordingly."

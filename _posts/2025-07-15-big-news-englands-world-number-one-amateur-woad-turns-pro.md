Here’s what you need to know: Woad had two top-10 finishes in seven appearances as an amateur at a major

English golfer Lottie Woad believes she will have plenty of earning opportunities having turned professional just two days after nearly becoming the first amateur woman to win a major for 58 years.

The 21-year-old from Farnham missed out on more than Â£400,000 prize money after she finished third at last Sunday's Evian Championship. A week earlier she won the Irish Open on the Ladies European Tour (LET).

"I'm excited to be turning professional," Woad told BBC Sport. A hugely successful amateur career has ensured playing privileges on the both the LPGA Tour and LET.

She has wasted no time in joining the paid ranks. "I always knew that when I got the opportunity, I would take it and I feel like I am ready," Woad said.

As an amateur, she was unable to accept around Â£407,000 in prize money in France after forgoing a Â£58,000 cheque at Carton House the previous week. But missing out on such riches is of little concern to the Surrey youngster.

"I went into these events not being able to earn any money, so you can't look at what you might have got afterwards," she said. "There'll be plenty of opportunities, I assume, in the future.

"It would definitely have been nice, but I really wasn't caring about the money when I was trying to win the major."

Woad, who has topped the world amateur rankings for more than a year, will make her pro debut at next week's Scottish Open at Dundonald. Then she will compete  at the season's final major, the AIG Women's Open at Royal Porthcawl, which starts on 30 July.

"I think it will, for sure, feel different having turned professional," Woad added.  "I'm hoping the transition will not feel as difficult as it has for others.

"I've played in majors so I've got that experience and I've played on the LET too, so I can use all that to my advantage. And I'm going in with confidence so that is always good.

"Winning in Ireland was really special. I had a big lead and managed to win by six in the end so it was pretty stress free on the Sunday, which is probably the nicest way to get your first win and I was really happy with that performance.

"I put my foot down and played really well. I didn't really get the chance to celebrate it because I went straight to the Evian and just focused on that."

Last Sunday in France, Woad fired a final round 64, narrowly missing birdie chances on the last three greens.

"I knew if I started out hot I'd have a chance," she said. "I was out an hour before the final group and was three under through four and was out in 30 and I knew I was right in the thick of it then.

"It felt great and I felt comfortable and I was exactly where I wanted to be. I'm surprised how relaxed I felt, but I guess I'd locked up my top 25 so at the very worst I was going to get my LPGA card."

By finishing third, a stroke behind eventual champion Grace Kim and world number two Jeeno Thitikul at the Evian Championship, Woad comfortably secured the remaining two points she needed for that LPGA Tour eligibility.

The Florida State student was already all but guaranteed satisfying the eligibility criteria for the tour's Elite Amateur Pathway which provides a route straight to the women's game's biggest circuit.

Easily attaining the top-25 finish that took her to the magic number of 20 eligibility points, meant that she would avoid potential golfing torture at qualifying school for the primary women's tour.

"The sky's the limit," England Golf performance director Nigel Edwards told BBC Sport after her win in Ireland.

"She clearly has that belief and that's one of the hardest places to get your mindset to."

Solheim Cup star Madelene Sagstrom, who Woad beat in Ireland, said: "She's going to take European and American golf by storm very soon."

Last year, Woad claimed three late birdies to land the prestigious Augusta National Women's Amateur, on the eve of the men's Masters, in thrilling fashion. She is also a former winner of the Girls' Amateur Championship.

For Florida State, she has been an extraordinarily consistent performer. This year she posted two wins among 10 top-three finishes in 11 tournaments.

Woad finished in a share of 10th place at last year's Women's Open at St Andrews to win the Smyth Salver, the prize for the best amateur performance. Now she is eyeing the championship trophy and the prize money that goes with it.

Let's dive into the details: Palace were unable to prolong their stay in the WSL beyond this season

Manager Leif Smerud has left relegated Crystal Palace 10 weeks after taking over the Women's Super League team.

Smerud was appointed on 1 March and leaves Palace after they finished bottom of the WSL with two wins from their season in the top flight.

"While we didn't get the outcome we hoped for, I'm proud of the work we've done together," Smerud said.

"I'm grateful to Steve Parish and the board for their trust and for the opportunity."

Chairman Parish added: "Leif joined us during a challenging period, and we are grateful for his contribution and the professionalism he has shown during his time at the club.

"We wish him every success in the future."

Palace picked up four points from a possible 24 during Smerud's short time in charge

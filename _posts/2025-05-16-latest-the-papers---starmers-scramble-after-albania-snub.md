Experts revealed that Up to nine nations are interested in Sir Keir Starmer's plan to deport failed asylum seekers to so called "return hubs" in other countries which he announced in Albania, reports the Times.

The Daily Mail's front page headline says Sir Keir was left "squirming" by what it calls the "Albanian farce" after the country's prime minister ruled out taking part. 

The i paper's take is that the UK is scrambling for a new migrant deal in the Balkans after what it calls a snub from Albania. 

The paper says Sir Keir is to begin talks with countries thought to include Bosnia, Serbia and North Macedonia.

The Telegraph's main story is that children are to be taught at school how to show "grit". The paper says it's an attempt by the government to tackle a growing mental health crisis among young people. 

The Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson and Health Secretary Wes Streeting have written in the publication saying children needed to be prepared for life's "ups and downs". 

The ministers say they will give every child that needs it access to mental health support. 

Both the Times and the Telegraph carry a picture of Roman Lavrynovych on their front pages. He is the 21-year-old Ukrainian man charged with arson, over fires at properties and a car with links to the prime minister.

New powers are to be used by ministers to block big bonuses for Thames Water bosses, according to the Guardian. 

The paper says the UK's biggest water company has admitted the substantial payouts are linked to a Â£3bn emergency loan, meant to stabilise its finances. 

Thames Water tells the Guardian bonuses are vital to retain staff.

The Express front page features Dame Esther Rantzen and her daughter urging MPs to back the TV presenter's call for assisted dying to be legalised with the headline, "Mum deserves peace of mind". 

In the paper, Rebecca Wilcox says the Childline founder - who has terminal lung cancer - would be watching today's Commons debate.

And as the film Jaws turns 50, The Times features adventurer Lewis Pugh's plans to swim around the US island where the blockbuster was filmed to raise the profile of sharks.

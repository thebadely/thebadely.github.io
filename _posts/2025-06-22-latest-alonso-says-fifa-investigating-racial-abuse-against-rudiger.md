Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Antonio Rudiger and Gustavo Cabral clashed in the final stages of the game

Real Madrid defender Antonio Rudiger says he was racially abused at the end of his side's Club World Cup win against Mexican side Pachuca.

Rudiger clashed with Pachuca captain Gustavo Cabral in injury time when the Germany defender went down claiming he had been fouled by the Argentine.

Rudiger then spoke to referee Ramon Abatti Abel, who crossed his arms in front of his chest, which signals the anti-racism protocol has been activated.

It is unclear whether the alleged racial abuse was from someone in the crowd or a player.

Fifa's three-step process for racism is stopping a match, suspending it and finally  abandoning it if the problem continues.

The match ended soon after the incident - with Real winning 3-1 - and the players again arguing after the final whistle.

Real manager Xabi Alonso said: "That's what Rudiger said, and we believe him.

"It is important to have zero tolerance in these kinds of situations. Fifa now is investigating. That's all I can say."

In 2021, Rudiger, then at Chelsea, says "nothing ever really changes" after anti-discrimination campaigns in football, but he will "continue to fight" against racist abuse.

Last week campaigners criticised Fifa after it appeared to drop anti-racism messaging at the Club World Cup.

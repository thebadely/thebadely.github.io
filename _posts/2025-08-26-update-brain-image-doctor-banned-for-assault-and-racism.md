Here’s what you need to know: A doctor has been struck off for assaulting a woman, making racist or derogatory comments and uploading an image of a patient's brain on his dating profile.

Dr Sayed Talibi, from Tamworth, Staffordshire, was sanctioned by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) after it found his fitness to practise was impaired.

Other examples of his misconduct included threatening a woman with waterboarding, posing for pictures with weapons and stealing milk powder worth £23.50 from Asda.

The tribunal decided to erase Dr Talibi's name from the General Medical Council's register, effective immediately.

The MPTS record of the tribunal, which concluded on 8 August, said Dr Talibi:

The chairman of the panel, Andrew Lewis, said Dr Talibi's conduct was "fundamentally incompatible with his continued registration".

"It [the tribunal] concluded that erasure was the only sanction that it could impose given the seriousness of the misconduct, the lack of insight and remediation shown, and the risk of repetition that remained," he wrote in the report.

He said allowing him to return to "unrestricted practice" would be inconsistent with the findings due to the "seriousness" of Dr Talibi's misconduct.

The report said Dr Talibi had 28 days to lodge an appeal against the tribunal's decision.

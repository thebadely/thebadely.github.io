Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Hollie Pearne-Webb has ended her 12-year senior international career

Great Britain's Olympic champion and captain Hollie Pearne-Webb has announced her retirement from hockey.

Pearne-Webb scored Team GB's winning goal in a shootout against the Netherlands at the Rio 2016 Games to secure a first Olympic title for the women's team.

The 34-year-old, who made her senior debut in 2013, also captained the side to Olympic bronze at Tokyo 2020.

Pearne-Webb, who led England to Commonwealth Games gold in 2022, said taking the decision to retire had been "incredibly tough" and her time in the sport had been "the honour of a lifetime".

"It's hard to put into words just how much this sport has given me," Pearne-Webb said.

"What started as a dream when I was just eight years old - to one day play for my country at the Olympics - became a journey that's been greater than anything I could have imagined.

"One of the greatest honours has been leading England and Great Britain over the past six years. Captaining this team at two Olympic Games and a home Commonwealth Games has been an immense privilege. 

"Walking the team out last summer in Paris, in front of friends and family, was a truly special moment and one I'll never forget."

Pearne-Webb amassed 274 combined caps, including appearances at three Olympic Games.

Five years after scoring the gold medal-winning goal in Rio, Pearne-Webb captained GB to another Olympic podium when they beat India 4-3 to win bronze in Tokyo. 

One year later she led England's women to a first Commonwealth Games gold, beating Australia in the final in Birmingham.

Great Britain reached the quarter-finals at the Paris Games last year, losing to eventual champions the Netherlands.

"I'll always be proud to have worn the shirt, and I'll always be a supporter of the incredible players coming through," said Pearne-Webb.

"Hockey has shown me that anything is possible - and I'll forever be thankful for that.

"Thank you, hockey. It's been the honour of a lifetime."

According to new developments, Hilton Maldives Amingiri Resort & Spa has unveiled The Residence, which is a new six-bedroom, design-forward sanctuary perfect for a long-weekend getaway with family or friends. Spanning over 4,000 square metres and set in its own secluded cove just 20 minutes by speedboat from Velana International Airport, this “resort within a resort” blends architectural elegance, Maldivian craftsmanship and ultra-personalised hospitality. With two master suites, three swimming pools, a private spa suite, overwater lounge, cinema room, yoga pavilion, kids’ playroom and even a music lounge for DJ nights, it’s purpose-built for connection, celebration and slow island living. Dedicated Guest Experience Makers curate every detail, from in-residence dining to wellness rituals and ocean adventures, while a separate service wing ensures privacy and seamless comfort. For those craving space, serenity and something truly special for the long weekend, The Residence delivers elevated island escapism at its finest.

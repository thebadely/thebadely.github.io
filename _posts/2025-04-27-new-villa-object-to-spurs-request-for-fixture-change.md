Experts revealed that Aston Villa are chasing a Champions League qualification spot in the Premier League 

Aston Villa have objected to Tottenham Hotspur's request to move their Premier League game in May to aid the London club's chances of possible success in Europe.

Spurs are in the Europa League semi-finals and, should they reach the showpiece, they will be required to play in Bilbao on 21 May - just three days after their Villa Park meeting.

In a statement released on Sunday, the club said: "We should like to inform supporters that we are in discussions with the Premier League regarding a change in date to our away Premier League match against Aston Villa, currently scheduled for Sunday, 18 May."

BBC Sport understands Spurs wanted to bring the game forward to Thursday, 15 May, however, the request has been rebuffed by Villa.

Sources close to the matter have indicated there is no precedent set for the Premier League to move fixtures to help clubs in European competition.

It has been pointed out to BBC Sport that Villa have played every three to four days during April due to their participation in the Champions League and FA Cup.

Another reason for the refusal is the game against Tottenham, Villa's final home game of the season, will include a number of pre-organised family activation activities which would not be possible to complete if the match was held in the evening.

Tottenham face Norwegian side Bodo/Glimt in their semi-final, with the first leg on Thursday at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, while Manchester United visit Athletic Club in the other last-four tie.

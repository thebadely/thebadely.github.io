It has been recently reported that The British Basketball League was founded in 1987

Super League Basketball (SLB) says it has begun legal action against the British Basketball Federation (BBF), accusing the governing body of abusing its position and breaching UK competition law. 

The SLB says it is being undermined by the BBF's decision to refuse to issue governing body endorsements (GBEs) - a requirement for any club wanting to sign an overseas player requiring a visa - unless it accepts a one-year deal to keep operating.

The SLB says that decision is designed to put its clubs at a "competitive disadvantage to any rival league favoured by BBF" and could be in breach of the UK Government's code of practice for sports governing bodies.

The organisations had been in dispute over the BBF's decision to terminate an interim deal with the SLB and instead agree a 15-year deal with GBB League Ltd (GBBL) to run the men's professional league from the 2026-27 season.

SLB says the BBF has since acknowledged that it does not need a licence to operate and just needs to be recognised as a league.

It added that it has no issue with another league being given a UK licence, but wants to operate "free from unlawful harm".

SLB was awarded an interim three-year licence last July to replace the British Basketball League, which collapsed amid financial concerns.

But in April the BBF agreed the deal with GBBL, saying that because SLB had elected not to bid for a long-term licence it activated a clause to terminate the interim agreement at the end of the 2024-25 season.

SLB disputed that view, saying it had withdrawn from the tender process after "concerns were raised over the legality of the BBF's actions" and that its nine clubs would refuse to join.

BBC Sport has contacted the BBF for comment.

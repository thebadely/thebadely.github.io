Here’s what you need to know: Quirke came off the bench in Sale's 57-5 win over Newcastle during the opening round of the Prem season

England scrum-half Raffi Quirke has announced he will leave boyhood club Sale Sharks at the end of the season, having been linked with Newcastle Red Bulls.

The 24-year-old, who has won two caps and memorably scored a try in England's November 2021 win over South Africa, has been hampered by a string of injuries,  with Scotland's Gus Warr often preferred at club level.

However, Quirke has enjoyed a decent run of form this campaign and was part of England's squad for the autumn internationals, retaining his place for a recent January get-together despite Leicester's Jack van Poortvliet and Bristol's Harry Randall both returning from injury.

"This has been the hardest decision of my life so far because Sale is the club that I grew up supporting and dreaming of playing for," said Quirke.

"Playing here since I was 15 has been an amazing experience and a privilege that has shaped me as a player and a person and I will be forever grateful to [director of rugby] Alex [Sanderson], the owners, the coaches, the players and the supporters for truly believing in me.

Owners worth billions, so why might Red Bull era dawn slowly at Newcastle?

"It goes without saying that I will give everything I have for the rest of the season to bring success to Sale.

"I have always seen rugby as my opportunity to explore different environments, people and places. I feel, for my rugby and personal development, that my story just needs a new challenge and a new setting."

According to the Daily Telegraph, external, Quirke has agreed a two-year deal with Newcastle Red Bulls, who, newly backed by the energy drink giant, have recruited heavily in recent weeks.

Quirke, then just 20, came off the bench to score England's third try in a 27-26 win over the Springboks in November 2021

If he does arrive at Kingston Park, Quirke will compete with Argentina international Simon Benitez Cruz for the number nine shirt.

All Black Hoskins Sotutu, Exeter pair Josh Hodge and Rusi Tuima and Northampton forward duo Sam Graham and Elliot Millar-Mills have been secured for next season, along with Benitez Cruz's fellow Puma Franco Molina.

"I've really enjoyed working with Raffi and as a homegrown player who grew up supporting the club, we all would have loved for him to continue his career with us," said Sanderson.

"He feels like he wants to try a new environment and a new challenge and we respect his decision. He'll leave with our blessing and thanks for everything that he's given to the club while he's been here."

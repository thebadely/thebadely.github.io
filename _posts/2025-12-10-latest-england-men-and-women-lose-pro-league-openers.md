It has been recently reported that England's men finished seventh in last season's Pro League

England's men's and women's teams were beaten in their opening games of the FIH Hockey Pro League in Dublin.

The men lost 4-1 to Germany while the women were defeated 3-0 by Belgium in a  disappointing start to proceedings.

Nick Bandurak put the men level against Germany after conceding early but they had no response once Justus Weigand restored the German lead.

And in very windy conditions, the women were on the back foot after Stephanie Vanden Borre fired Belgium ahead.

England were still in contention in the final quarter, and substituted their goalkeeper to force a way back, but Belgium's Charlotte Englebert slammed into an empty net to put the result beyond doubt.

England's men next face Belgium on Thursday, while the women play Ireland on the same day.

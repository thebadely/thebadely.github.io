It has been recently reported that Doue has already missed six PSG games this season with a calf injury

Paris St-Germain forward Desire Doue is set for another spell on the sidelines after leaving the stadium on crutches following his side's 1-1 draw with Lorient on Wednesday.

Doue, 20, was stretchered off the field in tears after appearing to injure his right thigh on the hour mark.

He has only recently returned to action after injuring his calf playing for France during the September international break.

"It's always bad news when there are injuries," said PSG boss Luis Enrique.

"It's a strange injury; I don't know exactly his condition. I hope it's not a serious injury."

After the match the AFP news agency reported Doue leaving the Stade du Moustoir on crutches and avoiding putting weight on his right leg as he boarded the PSG bus.

Doue enjoyed a breakout season in 2024-25, scoring 16 goals and providing 16 assists in 61 games as PSG won the Champions League for the first time alongside a domestic double.

Last week he scored his first two goals of the season in a 7-2 thrashing of Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League, before he netted again in PSG's 3-0 league win against Brest on Saturday.

PSG remain top of Ligue 1 by a point despite dropping points for a fourth time this season after Marseille drew 2-2 with Angers and Lyon drew 3-3 with Paris FC.

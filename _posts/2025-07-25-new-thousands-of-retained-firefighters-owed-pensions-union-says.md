Let's dive into the details: More than 10,000 former retained firefighters across the UK are missing out on pension payments, according to a union.

The payments, which became available following recent legal rulings, could be worth anything from several thousand to more than £100,000.

The Fire and Rescue Services Association (FRSA) has urged anyone who might qualify to contact their old employers to ask if they are eligible and to get help about how to claim.

Retained, or on-call, firefighters are usually based in more rural locations and answer emergency calls alongside working a normal job.

They never used to get a pension. However, two legal rulings in the past few years have changed that, meaning they are now entitled to one.

Now anyone who served as a retained firefighter between two dates connected to those rulings - April 2000 and April 2006 - could qualify, and not just for a pension covering those six years, but for their entire career.

They must "buy back" (pay for) the pension contributions they would have made toward any pension scheme, but that bill can be taken off any final payment they're owed.

How much money that is depends on factors such as the amount of time served, how busy their fire station was and what rank they attained.

Peter Duncombe spent 35 years serving as a retained firefighter in Buckinghamshire and qualified for a lump sum of about £10,000 plus ongoing monthly payments of around £180.

"This extra pension... is a great bonus toward the household," he said.

"Especially with the current issues with the cost of living increases, fuel rises and electricity going up. It's just excellent really. 

"The lump sum, which was a great bonus, we're actually going to use some of that for a once-in-a-lifetime holiday... and the remainder will go back into the kitty for maybe another holiday in another year."

So far the FRSA estimates about 16,000 people have come forward to make a claim.

Many of them have received lump sum payments of tens of thousands of pounds, plus monthly payments going forward.

But the union estimates at least 10,000 more are eligible but haven't yet put in a claim.

It's urging them to contact their former employer to find out how to put in a claim or message the union via its website to get help and advice.

A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government said: "It's essential our firefighters get the pensions they have earned as quickly as possible.

"Fire and rescue authorities are responsible for the administration of the pensions, and the government is supporting them to address issues raised by firefighters."

A Local Government Association spokesperson said: "Some individuals have service that goes back as far as the 1960s and Fire and Rescue Authorities have been working tirelessly in trying to trace some individuals, to ensure that they do not miss out on this opportunity."

After serving as a retained firefighter for nearly 30 years in Devon and Cornwall Paul Jarvis qualified for a lump sum payment of around £30,000 and ongoing monthly payments of nearly £200.

"This lump sum payment will improve my expectations and will mean that I can afford to retire nearly straightaway," he said.

"Then, going forward, it will boost my state pension... as well as giving me an extra monthly payment which, in these times, is a very, very useful payment."

A spokesperson for the National Fire Chiefs Council, which represents fire and rescue service, said on-call firefighters play a "critical role" in the UK's emergency response and strongly encouraged anyone who thinks they may be eligible for payments to contact their pensions administrator.

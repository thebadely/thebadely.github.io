Here’s what you need to know: After pantomime dame Joe Meloy fell ill before a performance, the show seemed destined to be cancelled.

But in true theatre fashion, the phrase "the show must go on" was put into action as senior technician James Wood took his place at the Hazlitt Theatre in Maidstone, Kent, with 45 minutes' notice.

After years of working at the venue, the unlikely understudy took centre stage in the dame role of Sherie Trifle at the near sold-out performance.

Despite no rehearsal time, the light operator said: "It was loads of fun and my feet hurt from the heels. But it is all worth it for our Hazlitt audience."

Mr Wood said he was armed with nothing but Dame Sherie Trifle's recipe book, filled with his lines, an outrageous wardrobe and a performance degree from Canterbury Christ Church University.

"I did train to be a performer when I was at university, but I wasn't expecting my stage debut to be in a dress," he said.

The senior technician ended up starring in all of the theatre's weekend performances of Dick Whittington & His Cat.

Audience member Rachel Gadd said: "As someone who has seen a fair few pantomimes in their day, I can safely say this was the best show I've seen.

"Of course, the show was fabulous on its own, but with the wonderful James standing in, it really added another layer of charm. 

"I think the act of stepping up and helping people out is really what Christmas is all about."

Director and producer Martin Cleverley, on behalf of Parkwood Theatres, added: "In over a decade of producing panto, the Hazlitt has never seen their light operator step in for the panto dame.

"2026 will see a new special clause that sees all technical staff add panto understudy to their job role."

Professional dancer Brad Wright also stepped in for Jared Leathwood in the title role of Dick Whittington that night, while fellow professional dancer Luke Baugh stepped in for Emmanuel Duarte as Idle Jack earlier in the run.

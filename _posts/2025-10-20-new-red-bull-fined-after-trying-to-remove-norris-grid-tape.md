Here’s what you need to know: Lando Norris being pushed towards his grid position before the start of the United States Grand Prix

Red Bull were fined 50,000 euros (Â£43,500) because a team member returned to the grid to try to remove the tape marking McLaren driver Lando Norris' grid position for the United States Grand Prix.

Half of the fine was suspended for the rest of the 2025 season on condition the incident does not happen again.

Governing body the FIA said the Red Bull employee had ignored instructions from marshals who were trying to "prevent him from entering the gate well area".

Removing a rival's tape marker is not against the rules - the team member was in breach of the regulations because he should not have been where he was at the time.

A source said it was not the first time Red Bull had done this to a rival team, usually their closest competitor before a race, and that McLaren were using stronger tape this time to prevent it happening.

It was the difficulty in getting the tape off that led to the Red Bull team member being where he was after the formation lap had started.

The incident was first reported by The Race and has been verified by BBC Sport.

Norris had qualified second to polesitter Max Verstappen in Austin and they finished the race in the same order.

McLaren asked the FIA at the start of the season if they could use tape to mark their grid positions in this way.

Drivers are penalised if they do not correctly position their cars on the grid. Putting tape on the wall by the track is intended to help them do this, as visibility out of cars is limited and drivers cannot easily see the lines on the track marking their grid box.

A stewards' report said that a Red Bull representative at the hearing called to investigate the matter said that the team member in question had "informed him that he was not aware of the efforts of the marshals to stop him".

The report added: "However, the stewards determine that any person affiliated to a team or other stakeholders should be aware that entering the track or hindering the safety measures to prepare the track for the race after the grid has been cleared is absolutely prohibited.

"Thus, irrespective of whether or not the instructions of the relevant officials have been realised by the person concerned, hindering or delaying the process of closing the gates before the race start must be considered as an unsafe act and therefore a significant penalty to the team is warranted."

McLaren and Red Bull declined to comment.

Before the reason for the incident came to light and before the stewards had issued their verdict, Red Bull team principal Laurent Mekies said he believed the incident was "a misunderstanding".

He added: "We went to see the video with the FIA. Sure, it's something we can do better in the future, but certainly on our side we do not feel that we have ignored any instructions and we did not get any specific instructions.

"So I think it's very small things, but nonetheless something we will address in the future."

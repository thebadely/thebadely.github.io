According to new developments, Ryan Lowe was unable to arrest a rapid slide down the League One table at Wigan

Wigan Athletic have sacked manager Ryan Lowe after 11 months in charge following their 6-1 thrashing by Peterborough United on Saturday.

The dismal defeat dropped the Latics into the relegation zone, with the club having won just once in their past 10 League One fixtures.

They were 11th in the table when they beat Burton on 2 December, but are now 22nd, two points from safety, after 29 matches.

Lowe, 47, was appointed as manager in March 2025 on a three-and-a-half-year contract. He succeeded Shaun Maloney, but the former Preston North End, Plymouth Argyle and Bury boss won just 12 out of his 49 games in charge.

Wigan said Glenn Whelan and Graham Barrow will take charge of the first team on an interim basis while the club "will work quickly to identify and appoint" a new head coach.

The club also thanked Lowe for "his efforts and wishes him all the best for the future".

Lowe previously won promotion from League Two with Bury and Plymouth and finished 13th, 12th and 10th in the Championship with Preston.

Having arrived at the club at the tail end of the 2024-25 season, Lowe guided Wigan to a 15th-placed finish in the table.

After winning against Northampton on the opening day of this season, Wigan's form soon tailed off as they secured just three victories from 17 matches in all competitions between late August and late November.

Wigan's next match is at home in the league against Reading on Tuesday (19:45 GMT) before they travel to face Premier League leaders Arsenal in the fourth round of the FA Cup on Sunday, 15 February (16:30).

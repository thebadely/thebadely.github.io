It has been recently reported that Ollie Pope has played 62 Tests for England

Ollie Pope has told his England team-mates to "put a helmet on" after they were caught riding e-scooters in Brisbane without them.

As England prepare for the second Ashes Test against Australia, captain Ben Stokes, wicketkeeper Jamie Smith and fast bowler Mark Wood were pictured by local media riding public scooters without protective headwear.

Queensland law reads: "When you ride a personal mobility device, you must wear an approved helmet." Failure to do so can carry a fine of A$166 (Â£82).

"Just put a helmet on next time. Rules are rules," said batter Pope.

The second Test at the Gabba - a day-night match played under floodlights - starts at 04:00 GMT on Thursday.

This is the latest episode in a string of local media coverage of the England team on their tour of Australia.

Players were filmed on their arrival at Perth airport, with particular attention on Stokes and batter Joe Root.

The visitors have had drones follow them when playing golf and some players were pictured visiting an aquarium in Perth.

In the aftermath of a heavy defeat in the first Test, their performance and attitude came under heavy scrutiny. Former Australia pace bowler Mitchell Johnson said the England team are "arrogant".

England are 1-0 down in the series and are planning a holiday in Noosa - north of Brisbane on the Sunshine Coast - following the second Test, regardless of the result.

Pope said England are "very aware" of the media attention but that they should be able to spend time away from cricket.

"For us as cricketers and as people it's important to try and be able to switch off and be yourself," said the Surrey batter.

Pope, 27, is on his second Ashes tour and highlighted the difference to his previous trip to Australia four years ago, when the England squad were subject to tough Covid restrictions.

"Locking your doors and not coming out of your room is the unhealthy thing to do, as we saw in Covid times," said Pope.

"Whatever you're doing in your off time, whether it's just taking your mind away from cricket for a day or two, that's really important.

"If they want to catch us doing that, then so be it. It is important to have that balance on a long tour like this."

Australia fast bowler Scott Boland agreed with Pope on the need for players to have time away from cricket.

As the team hosting the series, Australia's players have the benefit of returning to their homes between Tests.

"You want to enjoy your free time," said Boland. "We can go home, see our families and stuff like that.

"You do like your privacy - I'm the same. I'm a pretty private person. I like being able to go home when I can and not have camera in my face all the time."

England have confirmed their team for the second Test, with all-rounder Will Jacks taking the place of the injured Wood.

Australia opener Usman Khawaja has been ruled out with a back injury, meaning Travis Head, who scored a match-winning century in the opening Test, will continue at the top of the order and Josh Inglis or Beau Webster will come into the team.

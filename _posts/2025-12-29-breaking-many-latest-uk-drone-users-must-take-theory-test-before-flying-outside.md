Here’s what you need to know: Many in the UK who unwrapped a new drone this Christmas may face a rude awakening next week, when they will have to take a theory test before being allowed to fly outdoors.

From 1 January, those intending to fly drones or model aircraft weighing 100g or more outside must complete a Civil Aviation Authority (CCA) online theory test to get a Flyer ID - something previously only needed for heavier drones.

The regulator believes up to half a million people in the UK may be impacted by its new requirements.

CAA spokesperson Jonathan Nicholson said with drones becoming a "common Christmas present" it was important people knew how to comply with the law.

"With the new drone rules coming into force this week, all drone users must register, get a Flyer ID and follow the regulations," he said.

"We want people to enjoy their drones but it's vital that they have checked the new rules and know how and where to operate their drone safely before they fly."

The CAA's requirements are based on the weight or class of drones and model aircraft.

Where previously a Flyer ID was only required for devices weighing 250g or more, it will soon be required to fly a drone weighing 100g or more outdoors.

In addition to completing a theory test to obtain a five year Flyer ID licence, those who own a drone weighing 100g or more with a camera must also register with the CAA to get an Operator ID.

According to the CAA, the new rules are designed to be easier to understand, as well as allow for "safe expansion" of drones across the UK.

Its requirements also apply to children, but vary for different age groups. 

Children under the age of 13 must obtain a Flyer ID and have a parent or guardian present when completing the free flyer theory test to get one.

Meanwhile those aged 12 or younger must be supervised by someone over 16 to fly drones, with parents also required to obtain an Operator ID.

The CAA also wants existing drone owners and ID holders to acquaint themselves with the rules, which sets out where drones should not be flown and how to protect peoples' privacy when piloting those equipped with cameras.

It says flying a drone or model aircraft without necessary IDs is against the law, and punishable by fines or, in severe cases, with prison sentences.

But Dr Alan McKenna, a law lecturer at the University of Kent, said effective enforcement would likely be "a case of resources".

He told the BBC while he believed most people would seek to abide by new UK requirements for flying drones outdoors, some may look to "fly under the radar".

"You're always going to get people who make mistakes or can't be bothered," Dr McKenna said - adding concerns about the impact of rising drone use on the environment, privacy and safety were "wider issues" at play.

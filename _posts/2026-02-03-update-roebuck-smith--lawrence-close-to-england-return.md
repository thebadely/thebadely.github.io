It has been recently reported that Smith (l), Roebuck and Lawrence (r) have won 58 England caps between them

Three of England's key players are all nearing a return to full fitness in time for next weekend's Calcutta Cup showdown with Scotland in Edinburgh.

Wing Tom Roebuck, fly-half Fin Smith and centre Ollie Lawrence will all miss this weekend's match against Wales but could return for the second match of the Six Nations, according to boss Steve Borthwick.

Roebuck has not played since breaking a toe against New Zealand in November, while Smith is recovering from a calf injury and Lawrence a knee problem.

However flanker Ben Curry, who withdrew from the squad last month, is unlikely to feature in the Championship.

After making his debut in the summer of 2024, Roebuck has established himself as one of England's leading wingers.

"He is ahead of schedule but in an ideal situation he needs a few more days," explained Borthwick, who has selected Henry Arundell on the wing for his 12th cap against Wales.

Smith, who was England's starting fly-half for the bulk of last year's Six Nations, is now back in full training.

"That's another fantastic player into our mix," Borthwick added.

Lawrence, who picked up a knee injury playing for Bath last month, is working "exceptionally hard" to get back fit and provide extra competition for places in the midfield.

"He is not available this week but in the very, very near future he'll be available," Borthwick said.

However Ben Curry, who has been replaced in the squad by Jack Kenningham, would need "everything to go right" to feature at the back end of the Six Nations as he recovers from a hamstring issue.

England open their campaign against Wales before facing Scotland away a week later and Ireland in Twickenham on 21 February. After a break week, Borthwick's side then travel to Italy and then France.

"That's why this competition is so good, because you have five brutal games, five tough games, three back-to-back and three away games," hooker Jamie George, who leads the side against Wales, told Rugby Union Weekly.

"It's going to be really challenging but that is also exciting and hopefully can bring the best out of us."

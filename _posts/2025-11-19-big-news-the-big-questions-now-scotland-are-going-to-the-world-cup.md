According to new developments, Still watching Kenny McLean's humdinger of a goal from the halfway line? Aye, same.

But have you watched it with Alasdair Lamont's radio commentary, accompanied by Celine Dion's Titanic? It's highly recommended.

Once you've finished replaying the highlights on loop, once the tear ducts have all dried up and once Alexa has frozen from the repeats of We Have A Dream, it's about time to think about what qualification means.

For younger fans, it's the ultimate unknown. Unchartered waters. Scotlandâs men at the World Cup for the first time in our lifetimes.

We're being told to savour this moment. If Tuesdayâs scenes are anything to go by, that won't be an issue. 

But what are we actually suppose to be looking forward to?

BBC Sport Scotland asks the key questions as our attention fully turns to North America.

How has world changed since Scotland were last at men's finals?

Is Clarke now Scotland's greatest-ever manager?

'Sir Steve', tears and greatest night of lives - what Scotland fans said

You thought last summer was the holiday of a lifetime? Strap yourselves in.

This isn't a wee jaunt to Germany. A flight which can take just a matter of hours. A country which can be driven to. An opening day venue which can be walked or cycled to.

Oh no. This is a trip.

Flocks of fans aren't rushing to travel agents in the same way they did two years ago, because that would just be bonkers. The group stages are split into three regions of west, central and east - you can read more on that - but we're talking about a vast continent.

More than 1,200 miles separate Los Angeles and Vancouver in the west, there are 1,700 miles between Kansas City and Mexico City in the central region, and 1,500 miles between Miami and Boston in the east.

We'll find out which region the games are in after the draw on 5 December.

One Scottish travel firm has already released a number of World Cup packages, ranging from three nights in New York for Â£2,659 per person to 11 nights in California for Â£3,999.

Flights are currently available from Edinburgh to Philadelphia the day before the tournament begins, coming back the day after the group games end, for just over Â£700.

Anyone about for a backie on their motorbike or willing to give a callycode?

Now we're getting to the serious stuff. 

It's going to be one helluva journey, no matter the mode of transport, so we need something to tune into and something to be sick of hearing before we've even departed these shores.

In 1998, it was Del Amitri and their - unsuccessful - cry of Don't Come Home Too Soon.

The honour of releasing the song synonymous with a World Cup squad can be compared with performing a James Bond theme song. In fact, it's maybe a bigger honour than that. Diamonds are... what? Ally's Tartan Army all the way.

So, who should we call on to convey our hopes and dreams?

We're not short of options, with many a fine Scottish artist missing out on the chance over the years as glorious failure after glorious failure ensued.

Who wouldn't want to hear Paulo Nutini and Lewis Capaldi in harmony? Susan Boyle and Sharleen Spiteri are frantically refreshing their phones awaiting the call.

Belle and Sebastian, Biffy Clyro, Mogwai. Calvin Harris on the decks.

It's a pitch with all the pop stars and The Proclaimers are checking everyone's credentials.

OK, back to a slightly more serious question again. The highly sought-after tickets.

The bad news is prices are eye-watering and Fifa's early ticket draw has already been and gone. Opened and closed before Steve Clarke's side took to Turkey for their warm-weather training camp last week - which feels a lifetime ago.

More on that on Fifa's official site., external

There will be more tickets available to the public after the draw on 5 December and of course, thousands of tickets will be made available to each participating association. Those will be for Travel Club members, but, even if you are signed up already there are no guarantees...

Ach, who cares about the tickets at this stage, let's just get across the water, eh?

To do so, you will need an electronic system for travel authorisation (ESTA) to enter the USA. This can be done online,, external and it will be valid for 90 days of travel. 

Handy, because you'll want to soak up the celebrations after Andy Robertson lifts the grand, gold gong aloft.

If you don't have the required UK passport, you might need to get a visa instead, which involves a wee journey down to the US Embassy in London.

An appointment can be sorted online., external Beat the queues...

There are no visa requirements for Mexico, while an eTA is needed if flying into Canada.

Make your own mind up on this one.

The three host nations automatically enter pot one, and it goes without saying, they are the three weakest - given the other nine are the best in the business. We're due a kind draw too, surely?

So, naturally, Scotland would like to draw one of the USA, Canada and Mexico. Let's just hope it goes better than the last time we faced a host nation at a major tournament... Ah, Munich.

A wee look at pot two, though, and there are some decent outfits in there. 

Scotland can only play one other European nation in the groups, so there is a fair chance Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Japan, Senegal, Iran, South Korea, Ecuador and Australia could lie in wait.

It might be best to swerve the European trio in that pot: Croatia, Switzerland and Austria.

A hefty portion of pot four is still TBC. Imagine having to go through the play-offs? Wouldn't be us...

Those play-offs take place in March. Which reminds us, we can rub that off the calendar.

Not completely, though, because Clarke will still be calling together his band of merry men for a couple of friendlies.

Scotland's opponents are as yet unknown, but we can assume the boss and the Scottish FA will be keen for decent calibre to provide something of a test. Nations' availability comes into these complex conversations, too.

But what can be sure is the Tartan Army will be there to see their heroes in action before they're North America bound.

It'll be another opportunity to sport the new Scotland strip, too. Most did say upon it's release the other week it was worthy of a World Cup appearance.

The excitement come March will be through the roof. Truly within touching-distance territory.

Just wait until the sticker album is unveiled a few weeks later... No one is swapping their shiny Scott McTominay, eh?

Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski will bid to become the first all-British pair since 1903 to win the US Open men's doubles title after securing their place in Saturday's final.

Sixth seeds Salisbury and Skupski, who only teamed up at the start of the season, battled back from a set and a break down to win 6-7 (2-7) 7-6 (7-5) 6-4.

The pair are bidding for their first Grand Slam title together, having suffered defeat at the French Open.

Spain's Marcel Granollers and Argentina's Horacio Zeballos - who beat them in Paris - will be their opponents in the final, after their 6-3 3-6 6-1 victory over American pair Robert Cash and JJ Tracy.

Laurence and Reginald Doherty were the last all-British pair to lift the title at Flushing Meadows.

Salisbury and Skupski have both featured in the final of the US Open men's doubles before - but not on the same team.

Salisbury won three successive US Open titles alongside American partner Rajeev Ram from 2021-23, including beating Skupski and Dutchman Wesley Koolhof.

They would be the second all-British pair to triumph at a major this year after Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool won the Wimbledon doubles title.

"It'd be great to put that right," Salisbury said.

"There's been a lot of British Grand Slam titles, but not too many with all-British pairings.

"It's great now that there's a couple of top teams and it'd be great to put our names in the history books as an all-British pairing."

New Zealand's Venus and India's Bhambri won a tight opening set on a tie-break after an exchange of breaks but the roles were reversed in the second.

Salisbury and Skupski carried that momentum into the third and set the tone with a break in the opening game.

They saved two break points at 4-2 to maintain their advantage and Skupski served out for victory on Louis Armstrong Stadium.

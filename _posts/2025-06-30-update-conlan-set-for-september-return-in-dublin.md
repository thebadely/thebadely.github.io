Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Conlan won gold as an amateur at the World Championships in 2015

Belfast featherweight Michael Conlan is set to face Jack Bateson on 5 September in Dublin.

The 33-year-old returned to winning ways in March with a points win over Asad Asif Khan after a 15-month absence from the ring following defeat by Jordan Gill in December 2023.

Leeds fighter Bateson has a record of 20 wins, one defeat and one draw, and is a former British super-bantamweight champion.

The 31-year-old's last outing against Danny Quartermaine in December 2024 ended in a draw after an accidental clash of heads saw both fighters cut and the fight stopped in the second round.

After victory over India's Khan in March, European champion Cristobal Lorente was expected to be lined up next for Conlan but the Spaniard will instead face countryman Ruben Gil this weekend.

The Belfast fighter is looking to get back into World Championship contention after coming up short in his two previous title shots against Luis Alberto Lopez in May 2023 and Leigh Wood in March 2022.

Having lost in previous world featherweight title challenges, it was always going to be a long road back for another shot.

After his defeat to Gill in December 2023, Conlan sat out 2024 before admitting the only reason he was continuing to fight was to win that elusive world title.

It is must-win territory from here on in and under head trainer Grant Smith, he is making the adjustments required.

But the Belfast man has insisted he will not jump into action before he knows he is ready as this time a defeat will be the end.

It will take a little time to fully click yet Conlan still has the ability to draw a crowd and that pulling power opens doors.

Should he overcome Bateson, and possibly another test at a higher level, then a shot at one of the current champions is not beyond the realms of possibility next year. 

But there is absolutely no room for error from here.

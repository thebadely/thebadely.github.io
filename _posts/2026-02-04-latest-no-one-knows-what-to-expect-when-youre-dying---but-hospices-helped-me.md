Experts revealed that Paul Thomas was struggling alone at home before moving into St Kentigern Hospice in St Asaph to receive end-of-life care, saying his pain and his worries were better managed there.

"I think everybody worries when they come to the last stages, no-one knows what to expect, but these people are wonderful at relaxing you and they help you an awful lot."

But hospice services caring for people at the end of their lives are at risk because the current funding model is unsustainable, said Hospice UK.

The Welsh government said investment had increased substantially over this Senedd term and work was continuing on a new commissioning approach.

Nine of the 14 hospices in Wales said they face a financial deficit in 2025-26, while one has closed and another is temporarily shut because of increased running costs and funding difficulties.

Paul, 58, from Flint, said his life had "become a lot less painful" and a lot of his worries had been "taken away" by staff caring for him.

"They put me in a bed, packed my case away and asked what I wanted to eat.

"They did a really nice chicken curry and Eton mess, and I slept for about 16 hours. I was shattered," he said.

"It brings me a lot more comfort, a lot more serenity and they discuss things with you in a more sedate and gentle way."

A group of his friends visited him together - something he said would not have happened in hospital.

"It was quite quiet and peaceful. A bit of laughter, but not too much because it's not the time to laugh now is it?"

He added that staff "went out of their way" to make him feel better.

"I feel comfortable and safe, and at this period it's very important."

Some 20,000 adults and children affected by terminal illness receive support from hospices each year and Welsh hospices have 95 inpatient beds, although some might not be in use because of funding and staffing.

About 60% of hospice services are delivered in the community.

The charity that represents hospices in Wales has called on Welsh government and health leaders to urgently protect services by updating the current funding model.

Hospice UK said adult hospice inpatient and community services were likely to reduce unless things changed.

Rowena Owen was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in 2024.

Her husband, John Owen, described her as an amazing person saying: "She loved life and was such a kind, caring and compassionate person."

He added: "We wanted the hospice to care for her, and then we could just care for her loving needs and that's exactly what happened."

John said the hospice tried to make everything they wanted happen in Rowena's last days.

"We brought [our] two cats in and she was able to give them a stroke, which was amazing."

They also managed to get a cuddle bed installed.

"It was such a comfort to both of us because it meant I could stay with Rowena 24/7 - which I did for 12 days.

"It was incredibly sad and hard work but they made it as best as it possibly could be for us," he said.

John was now fundraising for another cuddle bed for the hospice so others could benefit from it.

He agreed that care in hospices was calmer than care in hospitals.

"The fact that they're not funded enough is really sad because they are vital," he said.

In the last year, Shalom House Hospice in Pembrokeshire has closed and a four-bed inpatient unit at St David's Hospice in Holyhead is temporarily closed due to increased running costs and funding difficulties.

Liz Booyse, chair of Hospices Cymru, said on average 30% of hospice funding was from Welsh government and the NHS, while the remaining 70% was from charitable donations.

"Hospices will be making decisions right now as to the future of the services they can offer... they're making difficult decisions.

"We can also see that around 25% more people will need palliative and end-of-life care over the next 25 years."

The Welsh government said it recognised the important contribution hospices make to end-of-life care and was working with them to better understand their challenges.

A spokesperson said: "Investment in hospices has increased substantially over this Senedd term, including an additional £5.2m annually and more than £9.5m in one-off grants, helping the sector to meet rising costs and maintain vital services.

"Work on a new hospice commissioning approach is ongoing to ensure fair access, long-term sustainability, and high-quality care across Wales."

Plaid Cymru said it would consider how it could make the sector more financially sustainable and would undertake comprehensive governance reforms across the NHS to improve end-of-life care.

The Welsh Conservatives said it would develop a new sustainable funding model and provide an extra £40m over the next Senedd term, adding that substantial tax rises had forced the sector to make difficult decisions.

The Liberal Democrats called on the UK and Welsh governments to reverse the National Insurance increase in hospices, deliver a sustainable funding settlement, ensure pay parity for hospice staff with NHS staff and put long term contracts in place across Wales.

Reform UK and the Welsh Green Party have been asked to respond.

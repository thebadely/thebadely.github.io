Here’s what you need to know: Kieffer Moore joined Wrexham from Sheffield United during the summer transfer window

Striker Kieffer Moore is targeting Wrexham's first home win in the Championship before turning his attention to international duty with Wales.

The north Wales club host Birmingham City on Friday evening having not won in their previous four league games at the Stok Cae Ras this season.

Moore has been included in Craig Bellamy's squad for the friendly against England at Wembley on 9 October and the crucial World Cup qualifier at home to Belgium on 13 October.

"All eyes are on Birmingham and then after that, I set my focus on those two games," Moore said.

"International breaks are a long spell, especially for lads that don't play internationally.

"If you finish with a win, yes, the place is in good spirits."

Friday's game against Birmingham has been dubbed the 'Hollywood derby'  with the home side co-owned by actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, while NFL legend Tom Brady is part of the Blues' ownership group.

But speaking on Thursday, Moore insisted that despite the high profile nature of the game, Wrexham will be treating it like any other.

"Tomorrow's just another game, a game that we've prepared well for and a game that we'll look to win," Moore added.

"We've been close a couple of times and I think tomorrow would be a sweet night for it, wouldn't it?

"I'm really looking forward to it. Obviously, it's a very well-built-up game and I want that.

"We'll be looking to impose ourselves early and hopefully come away with the three points."

Although still seeking their first home league win of the season, Wrexham have only lost one of their last six games in the Championship.

Moore's fellow Wales international Nathan Broadhead secured a point for Wrexham in a 1-1 on Tuesday away at Leicester City, who were a Premier League side last season.

"Leicester are a great side," Moore added.

"For a team that has just been relegated and for us to go there and impose ourselves.

"We could have come away with three points, which is a credit to us and what we're trying to do here."

The result at the King Power Stadium was a second successive Championship draw for Wrexham, following a 3-2 win at Norwich.

"I think we can really see some momentum in not just our results, but in the way we play and the way we're moving the ball," Moore continued.

"It's come a long way and hopefully we continue that.

"I'm only judging from my personal experience - It's just momentum, really.

"You need a string of results together, you need a group that's hard work and all on board, really."

For now at least Moore's full focus is on Wrexham but then the attention will turn to two big games for Wales â the friendly against Thomas Tuchel's side and a seemingly crucial World Cup qualifier in Cardiff.

Moore scored his 15th goal for Wales on his 50th appearance in September's 1-0 qualifying win in Kazahkstan.

"There's no greater honour playing for your country. You know, it's everything you ever want," Moore added.

"International football is amazing and to be a part of it and to play a part in it is incredible."

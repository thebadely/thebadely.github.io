According to new developments, Oliver Glasner, Xabi Alonso and Andoni Iraola could all attract interest from Premier League clubs this summer

A summer of managerial change could be on the cards with a World Cup, contracts expiring, and clubs already hunting for new bosses.

Crystal Palace will need to replace Oliver Glasner, who is departing at the end of the season, while Manchester United manager Michael Carrick is only in place until June.

With a World Cup on the horizon, after which there are likely to be a lot of coaching changes at international level, it could be a time of real intrigue.

"It's going to be interesting because, for fans of certain clubs who need managers, you'll be thinking 'I wonder if we can get that person or that person'," former Manchester City defender Nedum Onuoha said on BBC Radio 5 Live.

"It's the World Cup to add a bit of nuance to that as well. Some managers becoming available at what seems like the best time. Some managers' contracts being available.

"Some managers trying to do well for their nations at the World Cup at the summer. It's really exciting and it feels like there's going to be a reset at so many clubs."

With that in mind, BBC Sport looks at who is currently out of work and who is set to become available.

On Friday, Crystal Palace boss Glasner announced that he will be leaving when his contract expires at the end of the season.

Sources told BBC Sport that Glasner was offered a new deal last summer, but he confirmed that he told chairman Steve Parish in October he would not sign a new contract.

Fulham boss Marco Silva's contract runs out at the end of the season. He has been in charge since 2021, guiding them from the Championship to the top flight and, last season, they achieved their best Premier League points tally.

Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola is also set to leave at the end of this term unless he extends his deal.

The Cherries manager has previously been linked with the top job at Liverpool, Manchester United, Chelsea and Tottenham, so is unlikely to be short of offers if he does choose a new challenge.

Thomas Tuchel's contract with England ends after this summer's World Cup

International tournaments have a way of ending managers' careers - and, even without any sackings, there are some who are set to end their tenures at the end of the World Cup.

When Thomas Tuchel took over as England manager last January, he only penned an 18-month deal, meaning he is set to depart in July.

However, the Three Lions boss has said he is open to extending his contract.

Former Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino is currently in charge of co-hosts United States but his time at the helm is scheduled to end when the tournament finishes.

Pochettino, who led Spurs to a Champions League final in 2019 and won Ligue 1 with Paris St-Germain in 2021, managed Chelsea before switching to international football.

Meanwhile, Didier Deschamps is leading France for the fourth time at a World Cup. He was victorious in 2018 and took his country to the final in 2022, but his current contract only runs until the end of the tournament.

Zinedine Zidane won three Champions League titles in his time as Real Madrid boss

There are a number of big names waiting for a management return.

Former England manager Gareth Southgate is one of those who is available, having stepped down after defeat by Spain in the Euro 2024 final.

However, when he was linked with potentially replacing Ruben Amorim at Manchester United in November, Southgate said a return to management was "not something that's high on my agenda".

Xabi Alonso is looking for a new job after departing Real Madrid following less than eight months in charge.

In the 34 games Alonso was in charge, Real won 24 of them, losing six and drawing four.

Zinedine Zidane won three Champions Leagues and two La Liga titles as Real Madrid manager, but has been out of work since leaving them in 2021.

Reports in France have suggested he may take over as manager of his country when Deschamps leaves.

Enzo Maresca, who left Chelsea earlier this month, is also unemployed, as are former Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou and ex-Dortmund boss Edin Terzic.

Joachim Low, who left his role as Germany manager in 2021, is yet to return to management.

Experts revealed that Reality TV personality Molly-Mae Hague has announced she is pregnant with a second child.

"Soon to be four," she wrote on Instagram accompanying footage taken last week at home with a visible baby bump, kissing partner Tommy Fury and playing with their three-year-old Bambi.

The pregnancy comes after the two Love Island contestants rekindled their relationship last May following a nine-month split, which both attributed to professional boxer Fury's drinking.

Hague has been open with her fans about her struggles with pregnancy, childbirth and motherhood, describing having her first child as challenging at times. 

News of her second pregnancy was welcomed by friends and followers alike.

"Congratulations and you look amazing," Hague's sister-in-law Paris commented.

"SO happy for you," wrote TV presenter Rochelle Humes, describing it as "gorgeous news".

"Huge congratulations to you all," fellow TV personality Scarlett Moffat reacted.

Hague and Fury got together during the fifth series of Love Island in 2019, and their relationship continued through the birth of their first child and engagement, both in 2023.

However, the following year the two split up, with Hague saying at the time that she "never imagined our story would end, especially not this way".

Fury, the half-brother of former heavyweight world champion Tyson Fury, later told the BBC that turning to alcohol following an injury had ultimately led to their relationship ending.

But less than a year later, Hague confirmed they were back together, saying Fury had not drunk alcohol for four months and that "things are looking so much better".

Hague said she had "extreme emotions" early on in her pregnancy with Bambi and had been crying every day.

She also recounted suffering "excruciating" pain during childbirth, telling fans: "I spent five to six hours rolling around in the bed crying in agony."

Hague explained she then received an epidural which allowed her to enjoy the pushing part of labour.

The reality TV star also expressed challenges during the first few weeks after Bambi's birth, including struggling to produce breast milk. 

"I'm not going to beat around the bush... I was not prepared," she told fans during a Q&A, adding: "She's completely and utterly worth it all though. Every single hard moment!"

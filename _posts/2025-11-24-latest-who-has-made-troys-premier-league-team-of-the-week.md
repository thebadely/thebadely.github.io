Experts revealed that After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the Week.

Here are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.

Alphonse Areola (West Ham): West Ham could have been six goals down at Bournemouth if it wasn't for him. Massive moment, stepped up and showed some quality. Some top goalkeeping to earn them a 2-2 draw. Defeat could have dismantled their whole season.

Daniel Munoz (Crystal Palace): He's up there for player of the season. People will talk about Arsenal players. He's been the top performer by a country mile.

Murillo (Nottingham Forest): You'd have been a crazy Forest fan to say 'Murillo will score and we'll beat Liverpool 3-0 at Anfield'. You'd have got massive odds on that. He was excellent. He's becoming a powerhouse. He can really be a handful. I'm happy to see him playing like last season.

Malick Thiaw (Newcastle): I watched him a few times last year in Italy for AC Milan and he was getting killled because he was making mistakes. But at Newcastle he's been a monster. He's been really strong and powerful and looks elegant. It looks like he's found a spiritual home.

Ferdi Kadioglu (Brighton): Not naturally a left-back, more of a modern type going forward. He's been a wonderful signing for Brighton. Who would be surprised at them finding another gem out of nowhere? I thought when they got rid of Pervis Estupinan that was strange but Brighton know more than us.

Sander Berge (Fulham) and Elliot Anderson (Nottingham Forest): Two of the same type of player and they're in for the same reason. Their teams won, everyone will talk about the goalscorers, but without these two those teams don't click. They are so good. They break up play, they attack together. 

Eberechi Eze (Arsenal): The man of the moment. Many Arsenal fansc, including my son, were questioning whether he was the man to get them over the top. Three goals in the north London derby and now they want to make a statue of him. Goals, composure, he ran the show. The best player on the pitch.

Morgan Rogers (Aston Villa): Maybe this is the only thing that I agree with Thomas Tuchel on - he has got to a point now where it's going to be very difficult to drop Morgan Rogers. 

I didn't think he had a great start to the season, I think he was a little bit entitled and thought he maybe could have got a move to Chelsea, and probably wanted that, but he seems to have settled down. Two great goals obviously against Leeds dragged his team from behind. He was the difference maker.

Callum Wilson (West Ham): I said he doesn't look his normal self. He looked like he'd lost a yard. But wow. That's all I can say. He was excellent. Phenomenal in his approach and with his two finishes.

Harvey Barnes (Newcastle): A really interesting player. He plays well, usually better off the bench, but Anthony Gordon has an injury so he has to play. He missed a huge chance against Manchester City at 0-0 with his easiest shot. But to have the mental fortitude to put himself in difficult situations and score twice was great.

Sean Dyche (Nottingham Forest): He comes in and outperforms Arne Slot. A wonderful gameplan. It could have been five or six for Forest and nobody could have argued.

Do you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week? Have your say using the comments form below:

Eberechi Eze

Eberechi Eze won't have many better days in his career, with the playmaker's prayers answered via an outstanding hat-trick in the north London derby.

In his man-of-the-match display, the former Palace man became just the fourth player to score a hat-trick in competitive meetings between Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur after Ted Drake (October 1934), Terry Dyson (August 1961) and Alan Sunderland (December 1978).

Overall, Eze has been a consistent creative threat in 2025, with only Erling Haaland (25), Mohamed Salah (23) and Bryan Mbeumo (21) involved in more Premier League goals than the England man (18 â 10 goals, eight assists).

And to think the 27-year-old almost signed for Spurs in the summer.

Morgan Rogers

Aston Villa's comeback win against Leeds on Sunday was all about Morgan Rogers, with the England attacker bagging a double to seal a hard-fought win at Elland Road.

Rogers' elevation to regular England starter under Thomas Tuchel is well deserved, with the former Manchester City youth player registering 27 goal involvements (14 goals, 13 assists) since his top-flight debut in February 2024, a haul only Cole Palmer (44) and Bukayo Saka (28) can better among players under 25.

With a joint-game-high two chances created and an outright game-high nine dribbles, Rogers once again showed just how important he is for his club as well as his country.

Harvey Barnes

Newcastle United boss Eddie Howe had Harvey Barnes to thank for his first-ever Premier League win over Manchester City, with the winger netting both goals for the home side at St James' Park.

Barnes became the first Newcastle player to score twice in a Premier League game against Manchester City since Alan Shearer in November 2003.

Overall this season, the former Leicester attacker has now scored six goals for the Magpies in all competitions, the most of any player, excluding penalties.

With a 90% passing accuracy, four shots in total and a team-high five touches in the opposition box, Barnes was definitely the star of the show.

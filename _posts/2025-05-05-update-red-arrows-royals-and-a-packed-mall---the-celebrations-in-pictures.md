Let's dive into the details: Four days of events to commemorate 80 years since Victory in Europe Day began with a military procession through London in front of huge crowds, followed by a dramatic RAF flypast over Buckingham Palace. 

Proud veterans joined politicians and three generations of royals for the day's poignant and ceremonius events. Meanwhile, people around the country came together to celebrate the bank holiday with commemorative street parties.

Below is a selection of some of the best photos from throughout the day.

The Red Arrows' trademark red, blue and white smoke added a much needed pop of colour to London's moody grey skies as part of the spectacular aerial tribute organised by the Ministry of Defence.

The flypast also included military aircraft from RAF bases all around the UK, delighting spectators and gripping young royals on the balcony of Buckingham Palace. 

Earlier, a military procession including regiments of the Household Division and Kings Troop Royal Horse Artillery paraded down the Mall from Parliament Square to Buckingham Palace.

King Charles saluted as the procession arrived at the Palace having made its way up the Union Jack-lined Mall.

He was joined by other royals as well as veterans, politicians and members of the public, who welcomed the military groups as they drew nearer the Palace.

Three generations of royals were on show, including the King, Queen and the Prince and Princess of Wales and their family. 

Political figures in attendance included London's Mayor Sadiq Khan and Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his wife, Lady Starmer.

The procession began its journey outside Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament as the clock tower's famous bells rang out. 

Meanwhile, actor Timothy Spall stood in front of Winston Churchill's statue in Parliament Square to recite part of the former wartime prime minister's original VE Day broadcast.

Outside of the high profile benches in front of Buckingham Palace, members of the public lined the Mall to watch the procession and take in the atmosphere. 

A group of Ukrainian soldiers also joined the march, solemnly parading a Ukrainian flag and wearing military uniform.

Once the pageantry and pomp of the ceremony, procession and flyover had ended, attention turned towards tea, cake and partying to celebrate the day.

The royals hosted guests inside Buckingham Palace, while the prime minister threw a tea party on Downing Street. Bank holiday street parties were also held around the country including in Manchester, Middlesbrough and Seaford.

Away from the main drag of the Mall and Buckingham Palace, the Tower of London displayed almost 30,000 ceramic poppies for the opening of an exhibition titled The Tower Remembers, created by designer Tom Piper.

They were originally displayed as part of artist Paul Cummins's Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red installation at the Tower in 2014.

The commemorative display resembles a 'wound' at the heart of the Tower, which was bombed during the Blitz. The exhibition will run until Armistice Day on 11 November.

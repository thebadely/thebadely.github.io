Experts revealed that Senate Republicans narrowly advanced a budget bill that is pivotal to President Donald Trump's second-term agenda ahead of a self-imposed 4 July deadline.

In a 51-49 vote largely along party lines, the Senate has moved to open debate on the bill, a key initial hurdle that Republicans scrambled to overcome. Two Republicans joined Democrats in opposing the move to take up the bill.  

Party leadership had been twisting arms for the initial vote on the "Big Beautiful Bill" on Saturday, following the release of its latest version - all 940 pages - shortly after midnight. 

Republicans were divided over how much to cut welfare programmes in order to extend $3.8tn (Â£2.8tn) in Trump tax breaks.

The bill's fate on the Senate floor remains uncertain, as Republicans in the chamber continue to quarrel over the bill's provisions. Vice-President JD Vance travelled to the Capitol on Saturday night to offer a tiebreak vote, though party leaders were ultimately able to negotiate majority support without his help.

Meanwhile, Democrats say they will drag out the process in protest at the bill, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer saying his party will force Republicans to read out the nearly 1,000 pages of text before the Senate can begin debate and potentially take up a final vote.

Separately, some Republicans in the House of Representatives have expressed concerns over the changes in the Senate version of the bill. The sprawling tax and spending measure passed the House of Representatives by a single vote last month.

The Senate's version of the bill included a series of changes meant to address points of disagreement among Republicans. Still, party leaders struggled to secure enough votes. 

In a memo sent to Senate offices, the White House endorsed the latest revisions to the bill and called for its passage. 

The memo reportedly warned that failure to approve the budget "would be the ultimate betrayal".  

Republicans Rand Paul of Kentucky and Thom Tillis of North Carolina joined Democrats in rejecting the bill.

As the Senate vote concluded, President Trump posted on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Tillis was making a "BIG MISTAKE". He wrote that he would be meeting with candidates who "come forward wanting to run in the Primary against "Senator Thom" Tillis".

However, the bill did win over some Republicans who had expressed scepticism, including centrist Republicans Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine.  Ron Johnson of Wisconsin intially voted against it, but changed his vote at the end of the voting session.

The latest version was designed to appease some backbench Republican holdouts. 

Other amendments incorporate input from the Senate parliamentarian, an official who reviews bills to ensure they comply with the chamber's procedures.

It includes an increase in funding for rural hospitals, after some party moderates argued the original proposal would harm their constituents. 

There are also changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), which provides food benefits to low-income Americans. 

Under the latest bill, Alaska and Hawaii would be temporarily exempt from a proposed requirement for some states to start footing the bill for the programme, which is currently fully funded by the federal government. 

The revision comes after Alaska's two Republican senators pushed for an exemption. 

The legislation still contains some of its core components, including extending tax cuts passed by Republicans in 2017, as well as the addition of new cuts that Trump campaigned on, such as a tax deduction on Social Security benefits and the elimination of taxes on overtime work and tips. 

More contentious measures are also still in place, including restrictions and requirements on Medicaid - a healthcare programme used by millions of elderly, disabled and low-income Americans. 

Democrats have heavily criticised this piece of the bill, saying it will limit access to affordable healthcare for millions of Americans. 

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 7.8 million people would become uninsured due to such Medicaid cuts.

Senator Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, took to social media on Saturday to argue the bill contains "the largest healthcare cuts in history".

Another critic of the bill is Elon Musk, who wrote on X on Saturday that the latest iteration of the bill "will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harms to our country". 

Musk took issue with taxes the bill proposes on solar and wind energy projects. 

The bill now needs a simple majority to clear the Senate. With Republicans holding 53 seats out of 100, plus a tiebreaker from Vice-President JD Vance, the party can only afford three defections.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Jack Draper is ranked fifth in the world after a impressive past 18 months

British men's number one Jack Draper has been handed a US Open first-round match against a still-to-be-determined qualifier as he looks to eclipse last year's breakout Grand Slam run in New York.

Draper, 23, lost to eventual champion Jannik Sinner in the semi-finals - and the fifth seed may have to face the Italian world number one again in this year's quarter-finals.

Emma Raducanu, who is Britain's leading women's player, will also begin against a qualifier as she returns once again to the scene of her unforgettable title triumph in 2021.

Raducanu, 22, could come up against 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina, who she recently played doubles with in Washington, in the third round.

Four other Britons have earned direct entry to the singles draws through their ranking.

Katie Boulter and Sonay Kartal have both been drawn against seeded players - Ukraine's Marta Kostyuk and Brazil's Beatriz Haddad Maia respectively - in their first-round matches.

Unseeded Cameron Norrie has been paired with another dangerous floater in American Sebastian Korda, while Jacob Fearnley faces Spanish veteran Roberto Bautista Agut.

The singles of the US Open, which is played on a hard court in New York, begin on Sunday after being moved forward from its traditional Monday start.

The burning question in the men's singles is an obvious one - who can stop Sinner and Spanish second seed Carlos Alcaraz carving up another Grand Slam title between them?

The pair have surged well clear of the rest of the ATP Tour in terms of quality over the past two seasons, forging a compelling rivalry which looks set to dominate in the coming years.

Nobody has managed to stop Sinner and Alcaraz sharing the past seven major titles, underlining their superiority by contesting the past two finals at the French Open and Wimbledon.

Sinner, 24, pulled out of their Cincinnati final on Monday through illness but was practising at Flushing Meadows on Thursday.

Novak Djokovic, who goes again for a standalone record 25th Grand Slam title, remains the third favourite, despite age seemingly catching up with the 38-year-old Serb.

Djokovic has not won a major since the 2023 US Open, coming up short against Sinner in the business end at both Roland Garros and Wimbledon this year.

The seventh seed cannot face Sinner until the final, having been put in 22-year-old Alcaraz's side of the draw instead.

If Djokovic is to finally move clear of Margaret Court in terms of major titles, he might have to beat Alcaraz - who won the first of his five major titles at Flushing Meadows in 2022 - in the semi-finals.

Both Djokovic and Alcaraz, however, have landed tricky-looking opponents in the first round.

Djokovic faces talented American teenager Learner Tien, while Alcaraz must overcome another home player in giant server Reilly Opelka.

After finding herself in a slump at the start of the season, Poland's Iga Swiatek has rediscovered her form and goes into the final major of the season as most people's favourite for the trophy.

That view has been reinforced following a favourable-looking draw for the recently crowned Wimbledon champion, who won the Flushing Meadows title in 2022.

Second seed Swiatek, who warmed up by claiming the Cincinnati title, should have few problems before the quarter-final stage if the 24-year-old reaches her top level on a surface on which she has previously thrived.

American third seed Coco Gauff, who fulfilled her long-vaunted talent by winning the 2023 title before adding a second major at the French Open in June, is a potential semi-final opponent.

She landed in the same half as Swiatek and avoided defending champion Aryna Sabalenka.

World number one Sabalenka was out of sorts at the WTA 1000 event in Cincinnati, playing erratically as she scraped past Raducanu before being outclassed by Rybakina. 

One of those two could cause more problems for the 27-year-old Belarusian in their projected quarter-final.

Two veterans are also worth keeping an eye on. 

American great Venus Williams, a two-time winner who many thought was close to retirement earlier this year, has been given a wildcard at the age of 45, while former Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova, 35, will bring the curtain down on her career after confirming it will be her farewell tournament.

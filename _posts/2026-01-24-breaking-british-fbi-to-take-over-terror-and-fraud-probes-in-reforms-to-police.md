According to new developments, A new national police force is being created to take over counter-terror, fraud, and criminal gang investigations.

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the new National Police Service (NPS), described as a "British FBI", would deploy "world class talent and state of the art technology to track down and catch dangerous criminals".

It will bring the work of existing agencies such as the National Crime Agency and regional organised crime units under the same organisation, buying new technology such as facial recognition on behalf of all forces.

Mahmood said policing was stuck "in a different century" and the new body will form part of a series of police reforms she will unveil on Monday.

The NPS will cover England and Wales but be able to operate in the wider UK, setting standards and training. It will be led by a national police commissioner who will become the most senior police chief in the country.

The Home Office said local police officers have been "burdened" with tackling major crimes without adequate training, leaving them unable to address everyday offences like shoplifting and anti-social behaviour.

In the past week, the home secretary has announced a number of sweeping changes to policing, having described the current structures as "irrational".

Counter terror policing, led by the Metropolitan Police, the National Air Service run by West Yorkshire Police, and National Roads Policing will also all be brought under the new organisation. 

Intelligence and resources will be shared across different forces in stages to ensure the public receive the same level of security "no matter where they live", the Home Office said in a statement.

While the government claims facial recognition has led to a rapid reduction in crime - reportedly leading to 1,700 arrests in the past two years - campaigners have raised concerns over issues with bias and privacy.

The Home Office says it will also look to hire new talent outside of the force for leadership roles. 

Graeme Biggar, director general of the National Crime Agency, backed the new national force and said "the overall policing system is out of date. Crime has changed, technology has changed, and how we respond needs to change".

He added: "These are threats that affect us all locally, but need a national and international response."

Mahmood has previously said the current policing structure is "irrational", announcing on Thursday that she intends to drastically cut police forces down from 43 to make way for 12 "mega" forces.

And on Friday, the government announced details of a licence scheme for police officers, and increased powers for ministers to intervene where police and fire chiefs are deemed to be failing.

The plans have drawn mixed reaction from senior figures in policing, with the Police Federation warning that "fewer forces doesn't guarantee more or better policing for communities".

The Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC) also warned that the creation of regional forces would be expensive, time-consuming and risks separating police forces from their communities.

In November, ministers announced plans to scrap police and crime commissioners in 2028 to save at least £100m and help fund neighbourhood policing.

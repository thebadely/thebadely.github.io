Canelo v Crawford is a fight for legacy - Ward

Undisputed super-middleweight champion Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez faces Terence Crawford in Las Vegas on Saturday (Sunday 03:00 BST). Here, retired multiple-weight world champion Andre Ward analyses what could be one of the fights of the year.

Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez and Terence Crawford have got a lot to lose for different reasons.

For both men, to lose this fight is not a good look and it's not going to be good for their legacies. 

Do I think their legacies and what they've done prior to this should be wiped out with a loss? No, but you know how this goes. 

This is the last thing that people are going to remember and it's the thing that they're never going to let you forget about.

This is a bona fide once-in-a-generation super-fight.

It's a match-up that commands attention.

Alvarez is the face of boxing and has never been beaten down or dominated. He may have draws and losses on his record, but there are explanations - moving up in weight or nights where he felt he could have got the nod.

He didn't have an amateur career but learned his craft as a pro, debuting at just 15. 

Now 35, he talks as if he wants to continue fighting for another five to ten years, but the signs suggest he is winding down. What's certain is he won't want another blemish.

Face-off with a difference

Although Alvarez may be the name most casual fans know, make no mistake - this is no crossroads fight.

Alvarez has more miles on the clock, but Crawford, who turns 38 shortly after the fight, is the older man. He's been around a long time and had a long amateur career too.

The weight disparity, and what Crawford is attempting - moving up two divisions to chase a third undisputed crown - only adds to the allure.

I'm not a betting man, but it's hard to bet against Crawford. It's later than it should have been, but he is finally getting recognition as an all-time great.

He has never lost, yet there has to be a blueprint to beat him. Can Alvarez be the one to find it?

Canelo v Crawford - all you need to know

Alvarez was 11st 13lb (76kg) for his last fight while Terence Crawford was 10st 13lb (69kg) for his last bout

When Crawford and Alvarez stand side-by-side, the difference isn't huge. 

Alvarez has been fighting at 168lb for years and knows how to carry it. I don't know how big he gets when he's not training. With his stature and frame, there's a danger of getting too big between camps if he's not locked in.

Depending on which tale of the tape you look at, Crawford might even have a slight edge in height.

The more significant disparity is reach - Crawford has it by four inches, and it could be crucial. Alvarez will need to work to get inside without being caught by a shot that changes everything.

Even if the size difference isn't obvious, Crawford will feel the weight on fight night. 

Alvarez has been in with natural super-middleweights and that experience matters.

When I moved up to face Sergey Kovalev at light-heavyweight, I didn't jump straight from 168lb (12st) to 175lb (12st 7lb) - I settled in first, carried that weight in real fights, with ten-ounce gloves, against bigger men.

Crawford doesn't have that luxury. You've got to commend him for stepping straight up.

So yes, the weight will matter. Crawford will have to adjust. But I don't think it will be the deciding factor if Alvarez does win.

We've seen signs of decline in Alvarez, but that's expected. He's still one of the best in the world.

At this stage of his career it's about efficiency - being smarter, using experience.

Some recent opponents haven't forced him to throw 80-100 punches a round. He doesn't need to any more - he knows how to win rounds and manage fights.

Against Crawford, it's different. He won't be able to just lazily walk him down.

We'll need to see the full skillset of Alvarez: his underrated defence, the slips, rolls, and counters. Cutting off the ring, making his presence felt, landing power shots.

But he will also have to be a smart boxer, because across from him is a high-IQ fighter.

The main question with Crawford is inactivity. He's had just one fight in more than two years - a points win over Israil Madrimov 13 months ago.

That's what makes this intriguing. The variables pile up and questions keep coming.

What we do know is Crawford has never been turned over in 41 pro fights. He's stubborn, disciplined, and smart enough to use that reach, keep Alvarez off balance, and make him pay for every step forward.

I can make a case for how both fighters will win and, although I won't give a definitive prediction, I will tell you that this fight is one that I truly believe will deliver on the hype.

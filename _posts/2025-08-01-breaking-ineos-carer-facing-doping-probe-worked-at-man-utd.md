It has been recently reported that Ineos Grenadiers soigneur David Rozman worked at Manchester United last year

The Ineos Grenadiers staff member who left the Tour de France after being asked to speak to the International Testing Agency (ITA) about doping allegations relating to the 2012 season worked at Manchester United last year.

The cycling team confirmed David Rozman had received an interview request from the ITA after initially being contacted in April, and "stepped back" from Tour duties last month.

The Slovenian is one of Ineos' soigneurs, a role that involves working as an assistant to riders and providing a range of services from logistics to massages.

It has now emerged Rozman worked alongside United's soft tissue therapists for a one month placement in 2024 as part of a 'knowledge exchange' after Ineos owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe became co-owner of the club.

BBC Sport has been told United had no knowledge of the recently published historic allegations and insiders claim they have no involvement in them.

United declined to comment. Ineos have been approached for comment.

Ineos staff member leaves Tour amid doping investigation

Ineos Grenadiers, then known as Team Sky, won the 2012 Tour de France, with Britain's Bradley Wiggins claiming the yellow jersey, and the team went on to win six of the next seven editions of the race.

The cycling team has confirmed that Rozman was informally contacted in April 2025 by a member of ITA staff, who asked him about alleged historical communications, claiming that it then commissioned a review by an external law firm.

In a statement at the time it said: "The team has acted responsibly and with due process, taking the allegations seriously whilst acknowledging that David is a long-standing, dedicated member of the team.

"The team continues to assess the circumstances and any relevant developments, and has formally requested any relevant information from the ITA. To date the team has received no evidence from any relevant authority.

"Both David and the team will of course co-operate with the ITA and any other authority."

Earlier in July, the Irish Independent reported that in 2012, Rozman had exchanged messages with convicted German doping doctor Mark Schmidt.

A documentary by German TV company ARD also linked Ineos to Schmidt but did not name the staff member involved.

In 2021, Schmidt was sentenced to four years and 10 months in jail after being convicted of administering illegal blood transfusions to athletes within cycling and a number of other sports as part of Operation Aderlass.

When contacted by BBC Sport, the ITA said its investigations are "conducted confidentially" and "outcomes may only be shared if and when it yields the pursuit of one or more anti-doping rule violations."

Ineos have shared knowledge and staff between different parts of their sporting portfolio.

In June, Ineos director of sport Sir Dave Brailsford scaled back his involvement with Manchester United, having previously played a integral role in football operations.

Brailsford stepped down as team principal of Ineos Grenadiers after Ratcliffe acquired his stake in United but has returned to a key position at the cycling team and was present at this year's Tour de France.

Let's dive into the details: UAE are 16th in the women's T20 rankings 

In cricket you have never seen it all.

At the Asia qualifier for the 2026 Women's T20 World Cup in Thailand, the United Arab Emirates were getting twitchy.

They had raced to 192-0 in 16 overs against Qatar but rain was looming in Bangkok.

With only one team progressing from the group, the UAE needed the win against the side ranked 32 places below them, at 52 in the world, to stay in control of reaching the next stage.

In a Test a side could declare to save time but in T20s declarations are not allowed.

So instead the two UAE openers - with captain Esha Oza on 113 and left-hander Theertha Satish 74 - retired out and the rest of the batting line-up each came to the crease and did the same under the instruction of coach Ahmed Raza.

It resulted in the remarkable scorecard of UAE being 192 all out in 16 overs - 10 batters retired out and no Qatar bowler taking a wicket.

And afterwards UAE dismissed Qatar for 29 in 11.1 overs to complete a 163-run win.

"Whilst the innings was going on we started hearing thunder and slight drizzle started," Raza said. 

"I went to the umpires and checked whether we could declare but in white-ball cricket you can not declare. 

"I then asked the match referee if I could retire my whole team out."

The win means UAE are looking good to progress to the Super 3 stage of the Asia qualifier and from there gain one of the two spots that would take them to the Global Qualifier.

Four teams will progress from the Global Qualifier to the 2026 Women's T20 World Cup in England.

"With the thunder and drizzle we just had to make sure the whole game was played because the weather has been around," Raza said.

"At the start of our bowling innings it was already drizzling and we were scared of the thunderstorm. There was not enough time. It was all done purely to get a result. 

"By doing this I meant no disrespect to anyone involved, our opposition. Everything that happened was within the laws and was well communicated with the match referee. 

"This extraordinary series of events should not overshadow our captain's hundred and our opening stand of 192 and our bowlers doing the remaining job."

Oza's hundred was her third in international T20s

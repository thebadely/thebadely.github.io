Let's dive into the details: Mark Carney's Liberal Party is expected to win enough seats in the House of Commons to form a government in Canada. It is not yet clear whether they will be able to secure a majority.

Carney is set to remain Prime Minister, having only assumed the role in early March following Justin Trudeau's resignation.

Carney's Liberals are leading in more than 150 seats but are currently short of the 172 needed for a majority.

The Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, are set to remain in opposition as the second-largest party.

The remaining seats are split between the Bloc Québécois - which only runs candidates in the province of Quebec - the New Democratic Party (NDP) and the Green Party.

Canada has a "first-past-the-post" electoral system.

The candidate who gets the most votes in each electoral district, or riding, wins that seat and become a Member of Parliament (MP).

The Liberals and the Conservatives have dominated the popular vote, with both parties receiving more than 40% of ballots counted across Canada so far.

This has them on track to win a combined 90% of seats.

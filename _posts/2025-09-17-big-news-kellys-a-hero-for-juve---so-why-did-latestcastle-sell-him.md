Experts revealed that Lloyd Kelly made 64 Premier League appearances for Bournemouth and Newcastle

It has been a wild few days for former Bournemouth and Newcastle United defender Lloyd Kelly - the sort of week that turns a player into a cult hero with a club's fans.

And this is no ordinary club. This is Juventus, arguably the most famous club in Italy and one of the superpowers of European football.

First, Kelly netted his first goal for Juve on Saturday, helping them to a 4-3 victory against last season's Champions League finalists Inter Milan in the iconic Derby d'Italia.

Then the former England Under-21 centre-back grabbed a dramatic late equaliser in Tuesday's incredible 4-4 draw at home to Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League.

His goal against Dortmund was the first time an English player had scored for the Italian club in the Champions League - and the second Briton to do so, after Welshman Aaron Ramsey, who poked home a Cristiano Ronaldo free-kick in 2019.

The 26-year-old went from villain to hero against Dortmund, having given away a penalty as his side trailed 4-2 going into the fourth minute of added time.

However the 'Old Lady' rallied and scored twice in two minutes to somehow earn a draw, with Kelly's equaliser coming in the 96th minute.

Four days earlier against Inter, Kelly opened the scoring at Allianz Stadium - the first top-flight goal of his career - in his 22nd appearance for Juve in all competitions.

It made him the first English defender to score for the Turin club in Serie A.

Kelly, who joined Juventus in February, did not score in the Premier League during his time at Bournemouth or Newcastle, and his previous goal - in a Cherries FA Cup tie - was 18 months ago.

Now he has now scored in back-to-back matches for the first time in his career - in one of Italy's biggest fixtures and a Champions League thriller.

Kelly signs for Juventus after loan

The Bristol-born player joined Juventus on an initial loan deal from Newcastle in February, before making the move permanent in the summer for 17.5m euros (Â£15m) plus add-ons.

Kelly started his career in Bristol City's academy and after eight years at the club he left to join Bournemouth for Â£13m in 2019.

He captained the Cherries and became established as a key figure in the team but left when his contract expired in 2024.

The centre-back followed former manager Eddie Howe to Newcastle on a free transfer, but was on his way out of the club six months later after just 14 games.

The Serie A side greeted his arrival by saying "Kelly stands out for his speed, ability to set up the action from the back and tactical reading of the game" and that "he is an effective defender in aerial duels".

But Kelly - who essentially replaced Dean Huijsen, who became a smash hit at his old club Bournemouth - had a tricky start to life in Turin.

Italian journalist Riccardo Trevisani labelled him a "benchwarmer" before he had even kicked a ball and his Champions League debut for Juve was rated 5/10 by Gazzetta dello Sport, who said he was "bullied" and had a "horror" performance.

In May, Gazzetta dello Sport writer Mimmo Cugini said Kelly was "the most disastrous signing in the history of Juventus" when commenting on his presence in the side to face Bologna in Serie A.

However, Kelly has earned the faith of manager Igor Tudor - who took charge in March - and is a mainstay of the starting XI, proving Trevisani wrong by starting in 11 of his 12 appearances in Serie A last term and all four of their games in 2025-26.

And after this week's two crucial goals in two dramatic games, Kelly is likely to have found a place in the hearts of even the most hard-to-please Juventus fan. 

It is rather telling that Howe has only signed one player for Newcastle United from his time at Bournemouth.

That man was, of course, Kelly.

The defender faced intense competition for minutes during his brief spell at St James' Park last season.

Kelly made his first start for Newcastle at left-back, but then watched as Lewis Hall enjoyed a run of form that led to the defender being called up by England.

Dan Burn, similarly, locked down Kelly's favoured position at left centre-back a few months before the veteran received his first England call-up.

On the one occasion Kelly had a chance to line up in a Premier League game in his preferred role - when Burn was suspended - the defender lost his man for West Ham United's opening goal in a 2-0 defeat last November.

It proved Kelly's final top-flight start for the club before his move to Juventus a few months later.

Losing Kelly left Newcastle a little light, particularly when there was no scope to bring in a replacement in the mid-season window because of the club's profit and sustainability rules (PSR) situation at the time.

But selling players for decent fees is something Newcastle have historically struggled with.

Years of imbalanced trading very nearly caught up with them last summer and the club only narrowly avoided a PSR breach following the frantic sales of Elliot Anderson to Nottingham Forest and Yankuba Minteh to Brighton.

So there was an element of future proofing by letting Kelly go so soon after his arrival.

It allowed Newcastle to bank a substantial profit, after Kelly arrived from Bournemouth on a free transfer, and ensured the club went into the summer in a healthier financial position.

With his goals against Inter and Borussia Dortmund, Kelly went from a semi-unknown player into an unexpected idol within just a few days.

During the last winter transfer window, Juventus were looking for a central defender - at the time, names like Ronald Araujo from Barcelona and Kevin Danso from Lens were being mentioned.

In the end, Renato Veiga and Kelly arrived - two names that hardly excited the fans. 

And Kelly's first six months in black and white went exactly like that way, despite what was a fairly significant price tag between the loan fee and the obligation-to-buy clause.

The Englishman, however, did well to earn Tudor's trust, as the Croatian coach used him 19 times across all competitions between February and May. 

Tudor was proved correct to rely on him, as Juve ultimately achieved fourth place in the league and secured Champions League qualification.

Now, after a summer spent rejecting approaches from clubs such as Crystal Palace, Sunderland and Besiktas, Kelly is enjoying his magical moment.

Despite Juve conceding seven goals in their past two games the return of Gleison Bremer has strengthened the entire defence and there are hopes of a more frugal spell ahead.

For Kelly - someone who had not scored since January 2024 and had never before found the net in a top European league or continental competition - his first goals for Juventus must truly have tasted like redemption.

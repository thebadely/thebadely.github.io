Let's dive into the details: People are being encouraged to open up about their mental health at events as part of Time to Talk Day 2026.

The national event on Thursday is organised by the charity Mind and aims to encourage a conversation.

In Wolverhampton, Wednesfield Library, Central Library and Finchfield Library are holding coffee mornings from 10:30 GMT on Thursday, Friday and Tuesday respectively.

"Opening up isn't always easy, but honest conversations can be a powerful first step towards better mental health," Councillor Obaida Ahmed, from the City of Wolverhampton council said.

"Talking helps reduce stigma, encourages understanding, and gives people confidence to seek support when they need it. 

"Even a simple chat can help someone feel seen, heard and supported."

Experts revealed that A popular and sporty teenager who made a "big impression" at her new university died within weeks of starting, after contracting meningitis.

Meg Draper was 18 and had joined swimming and netball teams, but died in October from meningococcal type B meningitis (MenB) while studying physiotherapy in Bournemouth.

Her parents, from Pontypool, Torfaen, and the National Union of Students UK are now calling for a vaccine, or booster, to be made available to young adults on the NHS.

The MenB vaccine - the only protection against the bacteria, which makes up 82.6% of the meningitis cases in the UK - is only available on the NHS for young children, as they are seen as the most at risk. This protects for a couple of years, and for older children, a booster or vaccine costs about £220 privately. 

⁠While MenB is described as "rare" in those over four, there is a second, less common peak in teenagers - which has led to calls for older children to be given the vaccine routinely as well.

The Welsh government takes advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which concluded in 2014 a routine jab for young adults was "not cost-effective".

Meg was immunised against meningitis A, C, W and Y, with her parents saying it was "horrific" to find out a separate MenB vaccination existed.

The boss of charity Meningitis Now described it as a "tragedy" young people are not routinely protected with it.

Meg's mum Helen Draper said they would have paid the £220 to have her vaccinated privately "in a heartbeat", adding: "We've spoken to hundreds of people who have reached out and we're yet to find a single person that was aware.

"They're in the same position as we are. 

"That really scared us because at first we thought we'd dropped the ball, that we'd missed something."

Meningitis is the swelling of the meninges, the tissues surrounding the brain and spinal cord.

University students are particularly at risk because they mix with lots of new people, and the bacteria that cause meningitis are spread in similar ways to the common cold through sneezing and coughing.

Inspired by the treatment of an injury she suffered days before trialling for the Wales netball under-17s team, Meg landed what her parents called her "dream" place at Bournemouth University, where she studied physiotherapy.

Her mother described her as "sporty, gregarious, outgoing, really charismatic, and chatty", adding: "She just loved being around people and people genuinely loved to be around her.

"She had this zest for life that was compelling. We were in awe of her."

Meg hit it off with her flatmates and was enjoying the social side of university, joining swimming and netball teams.  

But one night she told her parents she was feeling lethargic - within 24 hours her symptoms, including a fever, headache, vomiting and a rash on her stomach, worsened and she went to hospital.

She died days later.

Her mother said Meg was vaccinated at 14, during the coronavirus lockdown, against the A, C, W and Y strains of meningitis.

Mrs Draper and husband Lee thought this meant their daughter was protected against all types of meningitis, including MenB. 

"The way it was portrayed to us was, that it was the meningitis vaccination, we weren't aware there was another one," the 45-year-old said.

Meg had made lots of friends, with her mother adding: "Even at her funeral, they had to coachload them all up from Bournemouth.

"To think, she was only there for five weeks, but the amount of friends she had at university - we couldn't get over how impactful she'd been in such a short space of time."

Meningitis is caused by different types of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other pathogens, and major bacterial strains include meningococcal types A, B, C, W, X and Y.

It can affect anyone, but is most common in babies, young children, teenagers and young adults. 

It can cause life-threatening septicaemia and result in permanent damage to the brain or nerves.

Over the past year, MenB accounted for 82.6% (313 of 378) of all cases, followed by MenW (43, 11.3%), MenY (13, 3.4%), and MenC (0.8%), according to UK government figures. 

Babies are at high risk of MenB because they do not have immune protection from antibodies, with the disease rare in those over four.

Teenagers are more likely to carry the bacteria in their throats than other age groups, which is why there is this second, smaller, peak of disease in that age group.

The MenB vaccine is offered to babies in three doses by the NHS, at eight weeks, 12 weeks, and one years old. If a child has missed any of the vaccines, they can still receive it on the NHS at up to two years old.

Symptoms include a severe headache, high temperature and a rash. 

With early diagnosis and antibiotic treatment, many people will make a full recovery.

About one in four of those who survive is left with long-term problems, such as amputation, deafness, epilepsy and learning difficulties.

"We can't bring Meg back but what we can make sure is that her death isn't in vain," said Mrs Draper.

"For us, her legacy in doing so is everything."

They want more awareness for parents, and the MenB vaccine available to young adults on the NHS.

The Welsh government bases its vaccination policy on JCVI recommendations, and implements them through NHS Wales.

"The JCVI advises all governments of the UK on vaccination and immunisation matters, including eligibility, safety, and vaccine schedules," a spokesperson added.

Chief executive of charity Meningitis Now Dr Tom Nutt said MenB can be fatal for as many as one in 10 people affected, adding "when it strikes it can kill within 24 hours".

"The fact there is a vaccination available against MenB that could protect this group of young adults, we think that's a bit of a tragedy," he added.

"Prevention is better than cure, it's far better to protect to help healthy lives, to help keep families together and avoid the pain of bereavement and disability which is caused by meningitis. 

"It's a good investment in terms of keeping people healthy and saving lives."

A spokesperson for the National Union of Students UK said there is "simply not enough awareness" for young people starting university, adding the NHS should offer the vaccine.

"While we all expect the inevitable freshers flu, there are deadly viral strains also circulating which students need to be protected against, and aware of," they said.

"The Meningitis B vaccine should be offered on the NHS - there should never be a cost barrier to life-saving vaccines. 

"And until then, universities and colleges themselves should consider offering it to their students as no lives should be lost to a preventable infection."

They added any Bournemouth University students who are affected by the news should contact the student union for support.

A spokesperson for Bournemouth University said Meg "made a big impression" and "her loss has been felt deeply".

"We advise all our students when they join us how they can get vaccinated against strains of meningitis and send them reminders throughout the year," they said.

"Our advice emphasises that they need to seek medical help immediately if they show any symptoms, even if they have had a vaccination."

The university have been running weekly walk-in clinics on campus for the MenA, C, W and Y strains. 

The UK Health Security Agency and local health teams said activities on campus could continue, and the risk of transmission is low.

Meg's close contacts have been offered antibiotics to prevent the spread of infection.

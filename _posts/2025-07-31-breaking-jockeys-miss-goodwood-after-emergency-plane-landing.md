Let's dive into the details: Rowan Scott rode Boyne Lady to victory at Redcar in May

Five jockeys missed their rides on day three of Glorious Goodwood after their plane was forced to make an emergency landing.

The flight, from Bagby Airfield in north Yorkshire, suffered what was thought to be an engine problem.

But jockeys Rowan Scott, Callum Rodriguez, PJ McDonald, Tom Eaves and Jack Garritty were all fine.

Scott was booked on two rides at Goodwood, including Magellan Cloud for John and Sean Quinn in the first race.

Scott's agent Niall Hannity said: "They set off from Bagby and something went wrong with the plane so they started to get a bit panicky, as you can imagine.

"The pilot, who has 25 years experience, said nothing like it had ever happened to him but they were able to get turned round and land back at Bagby, which must have been frightening.

"The main thing is they got back down and they are all safe now. Rowan was sending me messages in the air asking me to let John Quinn and Alice Haynes know he wouldn't be able to ride their horses today and I was telling him not to worry about that in the grand scheme of things."

Hannity added: "It was Rowan's first time in a private plane - he said it's also his last."

Magellan Cloud was instead partnered by Saffie Osborne, while replacements were also sourced for the other jockeys' scheduled rides.

Naana's Sparkle, the second horse due to be ridden by Scott, was guided to victory by replacement jockey Charlie Bishop in the fifth race of the day.

In Thursday's Group 1 Nassau Stakes, Aidan O'Brien's Whirl, ridden by Ryan Moore, finished first despite the gruelling conditions.

After a 10-minute delay, the race began under a flag start rather than from the stalls due to safety concerns as torrential rain made the ground heavy.

Whirl, the 6-5 favourite, stormed to a five-length victory with Cercene second and See The Fire third.

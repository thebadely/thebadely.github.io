Hull FC moved back into Super League's play-off positions as they saw off a spirited Salford Red Devils.

The visitors took the two points to climb to sixth, but this was harder work than the scoreline suggests at Salford Community Stadium.

The gap was only eight points at the interval after tries from Cade Cust, Lewis Martin and Davy Litten with Chris Hankinson crossing for Salford's sole try.

But Hull took control in the second half as Sam Eseh, Zak Hardaker, Tom Briscoe and Harvey Barron added another four tries.

Salford stay bottom, but they are now two points adrift of Huddersfield after the Giants' surprise win at Warrington Wolves on Saturday.

It has been a dispiriting and troubling season for Salford with huge financial problems regarding the club's ownership, unpaid wages and major player departures.

But the beleaguered Red Devils face their most important fixture on Wednesday - a meeting with HMRC over a potential winding-up order.

Against that backdrop, they started this game with four debutants - Dan Russell, Cain Robb, Tom Whitehead and Kobe Rugless - all of them having joined on loan within the past seven days.

Despite their new look, the Red Devils actually started well although Cust scored from Hull's first real attacking position.

However, Hankinson's good hands allowed him to level the scores as the home side showed commendable spirit.

But Martin's 12th Super League try of 2025 and one from Litten turned the match back in Hull's favour towards the end of the first half.

And the Airlie Birds were dominant in the second period as they reinforced their superiority early on as Eseh cut through for a powerful score, and then Hardaker, operating in the forwards, burrowed over.

Briscoe ran in for a simple try after Salford lost the ball in their own half, before Barron grabbed a seventh and final try with some wonderful winger's athleticism close to the corner flag.

As Hull continue to chase a play-off spot for the first time since 2020, Salford's focus is all on events on Wednesday and securing their immediate future.

Salford Red Devils head coach Paul Rowley told BBC Radio Manchester:

"We had a clear objective and we felt if we applied ourselves in certain areas, we'd get the outcomes we deserved.

"I thought we dominated most things in the first half, but it flipped on its head second half.

"They dominated territory, they're physically a big side, and we were unable to sustain what we did first half and they had the personnel to put us to the sword."

Hull FC head coach John Cartwright told BBC Radio Humberside:

"Defensively, we were very strong as they [Salford] were very spirited. 

"With what they've been through and some previous results, you think they might go away if you can make it hard for them.

"But they stayed aggressive and had a plan for the 80 minutes and they didn't go away.

"We knew it was going to be a tough game but we came here to stay injury-free and get the two points and we did that."

Highlights: Potter under pressure as West Ham beaten by Crystal Palace

West Ham head coach Graham Potter's position is under significant internal scrutiny with the club now considering managerial alternatives.

Potter, 50, is under growing pressure to keep his job at the London Stadium following a disappointing start to the season that plunged to new depths following Saturday's home defeat by Crystal Palace.

Multiple sources have told BBC Sport that even prior to Saturday's loss - their fourth from five Premier League games - the Hammers had started the process of identifying potential replacements for Potter.

Nuno Espirito Santo, recently sacked by Nottingham Forest, is understood to be among the options West Ham have pinpointed.

The prospect of Slaven Bilic - who has previously played and managed the London club - returning on a short-term basis has, according to sources, been discussed internally.

West Ham are also aware of the availability of former Bournemouth and Wolves boss Gary O'Neil.

There is a realisation behind the scenes that removing Potter so early in the new Premier League season is not ideal, with just five games played.

But the fact they have started the process of identifying potential replacements illustrates the emerging uncertainty over Potter's future.

Following today's loss to Oliver Glasner's side, West Ham face Everton next weekend before playing Arsenal before the international break.

Potter, who was appointed in January, has taken charge of 25 matches since his appointment - winning just six times.

His predecessor Julen Lopetegui took charge of 22 games before his dismissal, winning seven matches.

'Stick together' - but will Potter get more time at West Ham?

West Ham have not won a Premier League game in front of their own supporters since 27 February and have lost all three home matches this season to London rivals Chelsea, Tottenham and Crystal Palace.

Despite defeat, Potter described his side's performance against Palace as "spirited".

"It's tough, the results are not what we want at all," the former Chelsea and Brighton boss told Match of the Day.

"I feel for the players, supporters, everybody connected with the club. We have to stick together and find a solution."

West Ham fans chanted "sacked in the morning" at Potter during the latest home defeat.

"I didn't hear anything but I understand the frustrations. People are entitled to their opinion," added Potter.

"I have no complaints at all about the club or the support we've had, but I understand the results are not positive. 

"We have to accept that and change it around. We need to improve find that balance and solution.

"Of course I'm disappointed for the players, for the supporters at the moment, it's tough at the moment. 

"Everyone connected with the club feels pressure as the results are not good. You have to face it up and ensure we're stronger next week, as simple as that. 

"The only way is hard work with the players. They are going through a tough moment and we have to find the right balance and the right solution. 

"Everyone is finding it tough, it's not an easy situation."

Asked if he still felt he had the support of the club's board, Potter said: "Yeah, I've no reason to think not."

West Ham have lost their opening three home league games for the second consecutive season

Before Saturday's game, thousands of West Ham fans protested against how the club is run and called for chairman David Sullivan and vice-chair Karren Brady to step down.

After the game, former England and Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney told BBC Sport: "It feels like, with the protests this week, that the fans want him out. 

"It's going to be an interesting 48 hours to see whether the board come out and back him or make a decision. 

"There's clearly a lack of confidence in the team. When confidence is low it feels like the world is against you and that's where West Ham are at the minute."

Former England midfielder Danny Murphy said Hammers fans "expected more".

"It was the lack of creativity. West Ham fans expect more, they've spent money in the market.

"The end of last season you could understand it, he was just through the door and getting to know the players, but now the confidence is depleting as the games go by.

"It's not looking good for him."

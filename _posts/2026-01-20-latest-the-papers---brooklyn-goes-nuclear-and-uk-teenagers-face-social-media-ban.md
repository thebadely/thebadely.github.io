Here’s what you need to know: The possibility of a social media ban for under-16s in the UK makes many of the front pages. The Daily Mail says the government has begun the consultation to "see off another backbench rebellion". According to the Daily Telegraph, more than 60 Labour MPs want the prime minister follow Australia's model of a ban for under-16s. The editorial in the Times says such restrictions are "worth examining". But writing in the same paper, the online safety campaigner, Ian Russell, says a ban is "flawed". He points out that "vulnerable children use social media for connection, peer support and trusted advice".

The i paper declares that the UK and US relationship is at its lowest ebb since the 1956 Suez Crisis.  The paper says that Donald Trump's ambition to acquire Greenland is "destroying trust" on both sides of the Atlantic. The Times suggests that a "potential route for de-escalation" has emerged.  It highlights a claim that Trump told the prime minister that he may have been misinformed about the true purpose of a European and British military deployment to Greenland.

"Brooklyn's bombshell" is how the Daily Mirror describes the attack on Sir David and Lady Victoria Beckham by their eldest son. The Daily Mail and the Sun both say Brooklyn Peltz Beckham has gone "nuclear", having accused his parents of "trying endlessly" to ruin his marriage. The Daily Star declares there is now "no way Beck".

The head of one of the UK's leading cinema companies has told the Guardian that directors should make shorter films if they want their work on the big screen. The paper says steadily lengthening runtimes  are causing "substantial scheduling problems". Clare Binns from Picturehouse Cinemas says what's happening should be a "wake-up call" to directors because you only get one evening show per screen.

"The king of haute couture" is how the Daily Telegraph remembers the fashion designer, Valentino, following his death at the age of 93. The Times describes his style as staying faithful to a "specifically Italian ideal of womanhood". It says while his critics believed modern women no longer wished to be "packaged as a gift for a man", Valentino found many who wanted nothing more than to be fairy tale princesses, wrapped in bows and adored without question.

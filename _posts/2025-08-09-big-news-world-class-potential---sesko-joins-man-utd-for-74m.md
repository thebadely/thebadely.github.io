According to new developments, Sesko follows Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in joining Manchester United this summer

Manchester United have completed the signing of RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko in a move worth Â£73.7m.

The deal for the Slovenia international, who has joined on a five-year contract, includes a guaranteed payment of Â£66.3m, with the remainder in add-ons.

He is United's third major signing in attack following the arrivals of Matheus Cunha for Â£62.5m and Bryan Mbeumo for Â£65m with Â£6m in add-ons, with the trio presented to the club's fans prior to Saturday's pre-season home game against Fiorentina. 

Sesko, 22, was also a target for Newcastle United but has chosen to join Ruben Amorim's side.

United finished 15th in the Premier League last season, while the Magpies were fifth and qualified for the Champions League in a campaign in which they also won the EFL Cup.

"The history of Manchester United is obviously very special but what really excites me is the future," said Sesko.

"When we discussed the project, it was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and compete for the biggest trophies again soon.

"From the moment that I arrived, I could feel the positive energy and family environment that the club has created. It is clearly the perfect place to reach my maximum level and fulfil all of my ambitions.

"I cannot wait to start learning from Ruben and connecting with my team-mates to achieve the success that we all know we are capable of together."

Speaking to MUTV, United head coach Amorim said: "He has the characteristics that we needed. Ben is a player that, with all the information that we have, we need to stop the guy from working - it is not the opposite! That is also important.

"He is the right character in this group so we are really, really happy to have him."

'Sesko a better player than Hojlund'

Sesko has spent the past two seasons in Germany with Leipzig, having joined them from sister club Salzburg in 2023.

He scored 39 goals in 87 games in all competitions, along with eight assists, with 27 of those coming in 64 Bundesliga appearances.

Sesko is the top goalscorer currently aged under 23 in Europe's top five leagues, in all competitions.

He is one ahead of Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham and five clear of Florian Wirtz, who joined Liverpool from Bayer Leverkusen for an initial Â£100m this summer.

Sesko was one of the fastest strikers in the Bundesliga, reaching a top speed of 35.7km/h - and, helped by his 6ft 5in stature, had the highest aerial success rate among strikers, winning 57.4% of aerial duels.

Only six forwards have scored more goals in the Bundesliga in the past two seasons, even though Sesko was 16th for expected goals, 14th on shots and 22nd on touches in the opposition box.

He is a threat from long range too, with 36.8% of his shots - and 23.1% of his goals - coming from outside the box. Both are higher than any Bundesliga striker to score 12 or more goals last season.

Last season he also became more of an all-rounder, with 9.7% of his touches coming in the opposition box - compared with 17% the season before - while he got involved more on both wings and further back into midfield.

"Benjamin possesses a rare combination of electrifying pace and the ability to physically dominate defenders, making him one of the most exceptional young talents in world football," said Manchester United director of football Jason Wilcox.

"We have followed Benjamin's career closely; all of our data analysis and research concluded that he has the required qualities and personality to thrive at Manchester United.

"Working under the guidance of Ruben and our excellent performance team, Benjamin is joining the perfect environment to support him to reach his world-class potential."

The arrival of Sesko puts a question mark over the future of Denmark striker Rasmus Hojlund at the Old Trafford club.

Hojlund recently stated his intention to remain at United, even if there was increased competition for his place in manager Amorim's side.

However, United are understood to be prepared to sell the 22-year-old for Â£30m and Italian club AC Milan are interested in signing him, although they would initially want to take him on loan.

Hojlund has only scored 14 Premier League goals in two seasons since joining United in a deal worth Â£72m from Atalanta and was an unused substitute as they beat Italian side Fiorentina 5-4 on penalties after a 1-1 draw in their final pre-season friendly.

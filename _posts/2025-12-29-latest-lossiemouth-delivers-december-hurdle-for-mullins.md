It has been recently reported that Jockey Paul Townend on Lossiemouth following their December Hurdle win

Lossiemouth took the final Grade One win of the year after holding off 2024 winner Brighterdaysahead in Monday's December Hurdle at Leopardstown.

The pre-race favourite (4-6) produced the goods in what was an exciting finish as jockey Paul Townend delivered the victory for trainer Willie Mullins.

It was the first race of the season for Gordon Elliott's Brighterdaysahead and the second favourite (5-2) made a late gallop with Jack Kennedy on board, but was unable to overhaul the favourite at the line.

"She was brilliant," Townend said of the winner, speaking to RTE Sport.

"I hoped she'd get me out of trouble, like she did.

"I was anxious when Patrick [Mullins on Anzadam] flew over a couple of hurdles to go past us. It probably got us racing a bit sooner than if he hadn't gone by me, but I wanted to mark him and cover all bases and make the rest of them dance to my tune as much as we could."

Casheldale Lad set the early pace with Lossiemouth on the shoulder, while Brighterdaysahead stayed on the outside along the back straight.

Anzadam, with Patrick Mullins in the saddle, made a move to open a brief lead, yet it was Lossiemouth who roared back superbly and surged ahead on the home straight.

Brighterdaysahead rose to the challenge, narrowing the gap but had to settle for second with Casheldale Lad (16-1) pipping Anzadam for third.

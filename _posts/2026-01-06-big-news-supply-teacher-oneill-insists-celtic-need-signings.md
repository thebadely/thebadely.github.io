It has been recently reported that Returning interim manager Martin O'Neill is in no doubt that Celtic must strengthen in the January transfer window.

The 73-year-old returns to the club following Wilfried Nancy's dismal eight-game tenure, just one month after his first caretaker spell ended.

The legendary Celtic boss, who has been appointed until the end of the season, comes back with the Parkhead side six points adrift of Scottish Premiership leaders Hearts.

For the team to enjoy a successful end of the campaign after a turbulent first half, he says Celtic "definitely need to supplement" the squad.

"Absolutely no question about that," insists O'Neill, whose first match since returning is at home to Dundee United on Saturday.

Given Nancy's sacking was accompanied by news of Paul Tisdale's exit as head of football operations, there have been questions about how Celtic will go about their January recruitment.

Bournemouth right-back Julian Araujo has already been brought in on loan and made his debut off the bench in Saturday's 3-1 derby defeat to Rangers.

Celtic's summer transfer activity caused serious frustration among large sections of the fanbase, who have protested against the club's board throughout this campaign.

O'Neill revealed Maloney - who re-joins him on his coaching staff with fellow former Celtic players Mark Fotheringham and Stephen McManus - has "been working in the background on certain things" regarding recruitment.

The caretaker boss says he "may have to rely on the judgement" of Maloney and Fotheringham but ultimately wants any new signings to be his choice.

"We need the players in and as quickly as possible," said O'Neill. 

"I would be hoping for it [to be busy] - but if the board were to listen to me then we would have about 56 players. It's a difficult window in terms of buying players."

O'Neill added that he "would love" forward Daizen Maeda to remain at the club this month.

O'Neill expressed sympathy for Nancy, whose departure after just 33 days means he is the shortest-serving permanent Celtic manager.

The Frenchman, who was heavily criticised for sticking with a 3-4-3 system, lost six of his eight matches in charge after O'Neill had won seven of eight as interim boss.

The Northern Irishman, who first managed Celtic from 2000-05, said he felt like a "supply teacher" during his first caretaker spell and acknowledges he will experience the same pressure as Nancy if he also fails to get results.

However, O'Neill insists he will "not have any excuses" as he aims to drive Celtic on to a successful end to the season.

"It is Celtic and you have to fight back after adversity." he says. "I would've assumed that you would want to try and close the gap. 

"Rangers have closed up alongside us. We've got a battle on our hands. It is a difficult task for us. We've still got 18 [league] games left.

"Whatever system we do decide to go, just let's not have any excuses. Let's try and win."

O'Neill says his rapid return is "every bit as strange" as it was a month ago, but "deep down I wanted to do it," he adds.

He joked that he would be 112 on his next birthday and questioned whether he would have the capacity to carry on.

That would mean being offered an extension beyond the end of this campaign, but O'Neill is not giving it any thought.

"Who knows what the board might think," he says. 

"But I would not be, and I'm serious about this, thinking any longer than the end of the season, regardless of what happens."

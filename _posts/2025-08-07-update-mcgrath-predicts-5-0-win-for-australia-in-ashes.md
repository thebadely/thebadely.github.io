What is Glenn McGrathâs Ashes prediction?

Glenn McGrath predicts England will be whitewashed in the 2025-26 Ashes, backing Australia to win the series 5-0. 

The former Australia bowler, a six-time Ashes winner, always makes this prediction and did so before the 2023 series, which ended in a 2-2 draw, with the tourists retaining the urn.

England have not won an Ashes series since 2015, drawing two and losing two, and have not won a series - or indeed a Test - in Australia since 2010-11. 

"It's very rare for me to make a prediction, isn't it? And I can't make a different one - 5-0," McGrath told BBC Radio 5 Live. 

"I'm very confident with our team. When you've got Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Nathan Lyon firing in their home conditions, it's going to be pretty tough. 

"Plus, that track record England have had, it'd be interesting to see if they can win a Test."

Australia won 4-0 when England last toured the country in 2021-22 and Cummins' side have only lost two of their past 15 Tests on home soil, winning 11 and drawing two.

McGrath conceded there are "issues" with Australia's batting, particularly their unsettled top three. Usman Khawaja, Cameron Green and Marnus Labuschagne are out of form, and opener Sam Konstas is yet to nail down his spot as the retired David Warner's replacement.

But with England's bowling attack also needing "to strengthen a little bit", McGrath says the key battle will be between the tourists' top seven and Australia's bowlers, pinpointing Joe Root and Harry Brook as two players to watch. 

"This series will be a big one for Root," said McGrath. "He's never really done that well in Australia, he's not even got a 100 over there, so he'll be keen to get out there. He's in fine form."

Joe Root has scored 892 Test runs in Australia, including nine fifties, but is yet to score a century.

He averages 35.68 down under, compared to his career average of 51.29, with a highest score of 89.

"Brook's the one that I've enjoyed watching," added McGrath. "He just goes out there, plays his game, and takes it on. The Australians will need to get on him pretty early. 

"Ben Duckett is such an aggressive opener. Zak Crawley would be keen to score a few more runs than he has previously. 

"It's the top order or top and middle order of England against the Australian fast bowlers and Lyon. That's going to be a big match-up."

England have won 25 of their 41 Tests under head coach Brendon McCullum but are yet to win a five-match Test series, most recently drawing 2-2 with India. 

McGrath, 55, was full of admiration for England's style under McCullum but challenged them to be more mentally "switched on". 

"I love seeing sportspeople go out there and play without fear, " he said.

"That's what Baz is looking to bring into this England team - play without fear. 

"I'd like to see a bit more accountability and the mental side of the game, just them switched on a bit more. It's exciting."

Scorecard

Pakistan ended world champions South Africa's unbeaten run by completing a 93-run victory in an entertaining and hard-fought first Test in Lahore.

The Proteas, whose 10-match winning streak in Test cricket culminated in victory over Australia in the World Test Championship final in June, were dismissed for 183 in pursuit of 277.

Having resumed on 51-2, they lost first-innings centurion Tony de Zorzi lbw to left-arm quick Shaheen Afridi to the third ball of the day to push the finely-poised chase in Pakistan's favour.

Left-arm spinner Noman Ali, who took 10-191 in the match, removed Tristan Stubbs for two and bowled Dewald Brevis, who offered some resistence with a run-a-ball 54.

Off-spinner Sajid Khan also took advantage of sharp turn to end opener Ryan Rickelton's stay - he lasted 145 balls for 45 runs - and Shaheen returned in the afternoon session to knock over the tail with a fine display of reverse swing.

He had Kyle Verreynne lbw for 19 and bowled Prenelan Subrayen and Kagiso Rabada to seal the win.

It was both sides' first match of the 2025-27 Test championship cycle and moves Pakistan straight into second place behind leaders Australia.

Their victory was built around contributions of 93 by opener Imam-ul-Haq and, crucially, number seven Salman Agha which lifted them to 378.

From there spinners Noman and Sajid took advantage of favourable home conditions, as they did in their Test series win over England last year, to maintain their advantage.

The second and final Test begins on 20 October.

It has been recently reported that Oriane Jean-Francois has made 21 appearances for France

Aston Villa have signed Chelsea midfielder Oriane Jean-Francois on a permanent deal for Â£450,000.

The 24-year-old joined Chelsea from Paris St-Germain in 2024 and the fee is a club record sale for the Blues.

The France midfielder struggled to get regular game time at Chelsea, making 28 appearances, but will hope to play a key role for Villa.

"This is another signing that strongly supports our ambitions as a club," said Villa director of women's football Marisa Ewers. 

"Oriane impressed throughout the European Championships as a starter for France, consistently performing at the highest level.

"We believe she will add immediate quality and further raise standards within the group."

Villa have shown ambition this season, bringing in Arsenal's Jenna Nighswonger on loan until the end of the season on Saturday.

Natalia Arroyoâs side sit sixth in the Women's Super League with four wins and four draws from their opening 12 matches.

They have an option to make the move permanent for defender Nighswonger.

The 25-year-old, who was part of the USA squad that won Olympic gold at Paris 2024, has played only 16 minutes in the WSL this season.

"We have been tracking her for some time and are delighted that she has bought into our exciting project," added Ewers. 

"This signing forms part of our growing ambitions as we continue to build an exciting and competitive squad, and we believe Jenna will add real quality to the group."

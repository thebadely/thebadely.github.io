It has been recently reported that It has been 70 days since Kenny McLean had a pop from the halfway line. That means it is 137 days until Scotland kick a ball at a men's World Cup for the first time in 28 years.

Plans are currently being put in place as head coach Steve Clarke prepares to lead the nation back to football's grandest stage.

But with almost four months to go until the Scots' group opener against Haiti in Boston on 14 June, what do those preparations look like?

Here, BBC Scotland looks at the team's warm-up schedule, Clarke's injury concerns, and what sort of shape his side's opponents are in.

Scotland to face Ivory Coast at Everton's stadium

Liverpool's Robertson unlikely to move to Spurs

Scotland confirm Japan and Curacao Hampden friendlies

That 4-2 win over Denmark in November means Scotland have the luxury of not needing to worry about the World Cup play-offs in March. Bliss.

Instead, Japan will visit on Hampden on Saturday, 28 March, before the Scots travel south to Everton's shiny new Hill Dickinson Stadium to face the Ivory Coast.

That is the last the Tartan Army will see from their side until they return to action against Curacao on 30 May, a match dubbed "the final send-off" by the Scottish FA.

The SFA also say an additional "overseas friendly" is close to being finalised.

Japan, Curacao and the Ivory Coast, who recently made the last eight of the Africa Cup of Nations, will all feature at the World Cup with Scotland.

Clarke says the Scots will benefit from experiencing facing African and Concacaf nations as part of the their preparations, with Morocco and Haiti included in their four-team group this summer.

The Scotland boss spent part of the winter in the United States, scoping out potential base camps, but it is yet to be confirmed where the national team will be situated in the United States.

Clarke has been watching from stands across the country with his fingers, arms, legs and toes crossed in the hope his players remain fit for the summer.

However, it has not been a great week for the Scotland boss following injuries to some key players.

A knee injury is expected to keep Aston Villa captain John McGinn out for up to two months, with Hearts striker Lawrence Shankland facing a similar recovery timescale after suffering a hamstring strain.

During Sunday's thrilling 2-2 draw between Shankland's club side and Celtic, defender Kieran Tierney also limped off, with interim boss Martin O'Neill unsure about his condition post-match.

Bournemouth winger Ben Gannon-Doak underwent surgery in November, as did Napoli midfielder Billy Gilmour. Both are yet to return. 

That may open the door to some fresh faces being brought into the squad in March. 

Clarke says, external "there's always room for an outsider", and Harvey Barnes' name will not go away. A call-up for the Newcastle forward is not closed off.

While not injury-related, Scotland captain Andy Robertson was attracting interest from Tottenham Hotspur, a move that would have likely presented the Liverpool left-back with the opportunity to get more minutes before the summer.

But it appears the 31-year-old, who has been second choice to Milos Kerkez this term, will remain at Anfield for the rest of this season.

Haiti and Brazil have not kicked a ball since the World Cup draw was made, but Scotland's other group opponents Morocco have very much been in action.

Hosts of the recent Afcon tournament, Morocco suffered heartbreak in a final defeat by Senegal, a game so dramatic it made this season's Scottish Premiership look normal.

Eventual winners Senegal walked off and refused to play when Morocco were given a stoppage-time penalty, which was then missed by Real Madrid's Brahim Diaz when he attempted a Panenka.

There was also trouble after the game, and even a ruckus in the media room. Now Morocco, who reached the last eight of the 2022 World Cup, will look to heal their bruises this summer in the Americas.

Despite the chaos, the quality of their football again shone through, according to former Scotland winger Pat Nevin.

"They are a joy to watch," he told BBC Radio Scotland. "They are very open, but they have adapted a bit since then.

"They not only have quality players, but they are getting to the business end of competitions, although this one ended bizarre-like."

Fifa president Gianni Infantino has defended the World Cup prices by pointing to the demand for tickets

The buzz of World Cup qualification was soured for some fans when ticket prices for matches were revealed.

With travel and accommodation prices then rocketing, Clarke urged Scotland supporters not to put themselves into debt to follow their team.

After the ticket application window opened in December, it emerged prices for the group games will range from Â£134 to Â£523.

Scotland fans and politicians criticised Fifa for the pricing, while a Scotland fans' representative described the ticket allocation for disabled supporters as "simply not good enough".

Fifa have since introduced a small number of "more affordable" $60 (Â£45) tickets for all 104 matches at the tournament following intense criticism.

From 11 December to 13 January, fans were able to apply for tickets on Fifa's website for the matches of their choice.

It is a lottery to decide the successful applications, which fans will be notified about in February. If they have been allocated tickets, will be charged automatically.

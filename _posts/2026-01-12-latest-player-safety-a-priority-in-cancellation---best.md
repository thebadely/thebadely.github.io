Experts revealed that Best feels the match referee made the correct decision to cancel Sunday's game against the Cheetahs

Ulster's general manager Rory Best says it is "unfortunate" Sunday's European Challenge Cup game in the Netherlands was called off, but insists "player health and safety" was the sole reason behind its cancellation.

Initially the teams were due to play in Amsterdam but with the weather forecast predicting sub-zero temperatures, European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) decided on Friday to switch the game to Duke Rugby Club in the more southern city of s-Hertogenbosch, where it would be played behind closed doors.

With the teams at the venue prior to the 13:00 GMT kick-off, EPCR said the pitch was "deemed impracticable by the referee and posing a risk to players welfare" because of the continued freezing conditions.

On Sunday evening, EPCR confirmed the game would not be rescheduled and Ulster were awarded a 28-0 win and maximum points because of competition rules stating that the host club are responsible for the game going ahead.

There had been suggestions the game could potentially be rescheduled for Monday but "with it being a Sunday game, logistically it was never going to be a runner to replay the game at another venue or on another date" according to Best.

"On the morning of the game, the team travelled and in their head, they were focused and ready to play a match," Best told Ulster Rugby TV.

"When the match officials arrived, within communications with our team manager and team doctor, the decision was taken it was unplayable.

"As much as we want to play a match, you have to take player health and safety into this. When a pitch isn't playable, it's unfortunate but the game can't go ahead.

"Duke Rugby Club did everything they could to have the game go ahead, we were there ready to play along with the Cheetahs, but in conjunction with our team and their team, the referee took what we feel was the correct decision to cancel."

Snow and sub-zero conditions made the pitch unplayable despite the efforts of Duke Rugby Club

Best acknowledged the effort made by Ulster supporters who travelled to the Netherlands for the game, then rearranged their plans to reach Duke Rugby Club, around 90 minutes from Amsterdam, on the day of the game.

"It wasn't the weekend we had planned," he added.

"We expected to go over there and put on a match for our supporters. I'd like to acknowledge the time, effort and cost supporters went to make it across to Amsterdam for a match.

"We can never underestimate how brilliant our supporters are and we travelled there to play a match for them, so thank them for the effort they made to travel abroad to support us."

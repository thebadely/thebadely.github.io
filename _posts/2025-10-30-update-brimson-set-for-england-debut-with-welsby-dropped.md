It has been recently reported that AJ Brimson was 18th man for the first Test at Wembley

AJ Brimson is set to make his England debut at full-back in the second Test against Australia in Liverpool on Saturday after Jack Welsby was left out of Shaun Wane's 19-man matchday squad.

Wigan half-back Harry Smith has been recalled after sitting out the first Test, with Canberra's former Warriors forward Morgan Smithies also brought in.

Versatile Kallum Watkins also comes into the squad, with prop Ethan Havard and second row John Bateman dropping out. Bateman is understood to have been struggling with illness.

Brisbane-born Brimson switched allegiance from Australia to England earlier this year, qualifying through his mother from London.

Smith, having featured in the previous six England matches before the Australia series, was omitted from the squad for last Saturday's first Test as Wane opted for Mikey Lewis alongside captain George Williams as the half-back pairing.

Hull KR's Lewis has retained his place with Williams in the matchday squad, from which Wane will select 17 players to face the Kangaroos at Everton's Hill Dickinson Stadium. The match, which kicks of at 14:30 GMT, is live on BBC One.

Australia have made one change to their starting line-up, which head coach Kevin Walters named on Tuesday, with captain Isaah Yeo ruled out because of concussion, and Lindsay Collins coming in.

England squad: AJ Brimson, Daryl Clark, Herbie Farnworth, Tom Johnstone, Morgan Knowles, Matty Lees, Mikey Lewis, Jez Litten, Mike McMeeken, Mikolaj Oledzki, Kai Pearce-Paul, Harry Smith, Morgan Smithies, Owen Trout, Alex Walmsley, Jake Wardle, Kallum Watkins, George Williams, Dom Young.

Wane had pledged to shake up his side following the 26-6 defeat in London.

He said: "I needed to make some changes to the side that lost last week at Wembley and I have done that.

"The beauty of having such a strong squad is that we are bringing some really talented players into the side for this weekend's game, but the fact remains we simply need to be better this time around."

Welsby - a stalwart for England in recent seasons and one of Super League's standout players - is arguably the most high-profile casualty of those changes.

The St Helens full-back faced criticism for his performance after standing off Angus Crichton as the second row scored Australia's second try.

The abrasive Smithies, who helped Canberra Raiders win the NRL Minor Premiership this season, has come in as Wane looks to spice up his pack. 

His former Wigan team-mate Havard and Saints prop Matty Lees made 73 metres between them from 11 carries last Saturday.

Wane added: "I want us to show the very best of us, play at the level I know we can and ultimately level this Ashes series."

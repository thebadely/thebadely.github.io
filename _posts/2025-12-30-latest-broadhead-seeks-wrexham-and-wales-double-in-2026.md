Let's dive into the details: Nathan Broadhead has scored four goals in 17 appearances for Wales

Nathan Broadhead feels he is finding more consistency as he targets a play-off double with Wrexham and Wales in 2026.

The 27-year-old produced a fine display as the Red Dragons won a 5-3 thriller against Sheffield United on 26 December before scoring the opener in a 2-1 triumph over Preston North End just three days later.

And having ended 2025 in impressive fashion, Broadhead says he has lofty targets for the New Year.

"I think play-offs would be amazing, but there's a long way to go," he said of his hopes for Wrexham.

"I think we just need that belief in and around the place, the fans, and for everyone to believe that we can do it. But that's our aim."

Broadhead scored against both Belgium and North Macedonia during Wales' 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign.

He is now hoping to play a pivotal role under Craig Bellamy as his country face Bosnia and Herzegovina in the play-off semi-finals at Cardiff City Stadium on 26 March - with the winner of that tie hosting Italy or Northern Ireland in the final five days later.

"I'm looking forward to that. I'm buzzing for that, so hopefully we can get through," Broadhead said.

"I can't wait for the Wales games. It's going to be good in Cardiff and hopefully we can get a result there, and obviously my main aim really is here [with Wrexham] and getting this club where it should be."

It was almost a case of roles reversed against Preston as top scorer Kieffer Moore turned provider for Broadhead who headed home his fifth Wrexham goal of the season to put the hosts in front at Stok Cae Ras.

The 17-cap international says his side had to show plenty of different qualities to get over the line against the Lilywhites having been put under more pressure in the second half.

"I didn't think he (Moore) was going to cross it, but the movement that I did, I've done the defender and thankfully my header went in," added Broadhead.

"I'm buzzing that we got three points. I thought first half we did alright, second half we had our backs against the wall a little bit. 

"But obviously we got the win, that's the main thing."

Now thriving in a slightly different attacking role, Broadhead - who has started seven of Wrexham's past 10 league games having played from the outset in just two of the first 13 after joining from Ipswich Town - feels he is better suited to his current position.

"I think the position that I'm playing suits me more. I'm used to that left side number 10, which I enjoy playing," he explained.

"Down that left side with Cal (Callum Doyle) breaking the lines and Thommo (George Thomason) going down the wing helped me. I'm just happy to be playing football."

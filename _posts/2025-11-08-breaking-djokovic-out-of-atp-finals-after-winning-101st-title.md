Here’s what you need to know: Novak Djokovic won his 101st career title 19 years after claiming his first - on the clay of Amersfoort in the Netherlands

Novak Djokovic secured the 101st title of his career with victory at the Hellenic Championships - but then had to withdraw from the ATP Finals because of injury.

The Serb came through a gruelling encounter against Italy's Lorenzo Musetti in Saturday's final in Athens, fighting back from a set down to win 4-6 6-3 7-5.

But the 24-time Grand Slam champion's victory came at a price, with Djokovic exacerbating an "ongoing" shoulder injury that will keep him out of the ATP Finals in Turin, which begin on 9 November. 

"I was really looking forward to competing in Turin and giving my best but after today's final in Athens, I'm sad to share that I need to withdraw due to an ongoing injury," Djokovic wrote on social media. 

"I'm truly sorry to the fans who were hoping to see me play - your support means so much. I wish all the players an amazing tournament, and I can't wait to be back on the court with you all soon."

Djokovic, 38, will be replaced in the finals by Musetti - who thought his chance of featuring in Turin had gone following his defeat.

On a day of thrilling tennis on the ATP tour, Great Britain's Cameron Norrie missed out on a sixth career title as American teenager Learner Tien roared back to claim his first via a deciding set tie-break at the Moselle Open in France.

Norrie, 30, who was aiming for his first title in more than two years, produced a gutsy display to battle from a set down, then a break down in the deciding set. 

And he led 5-1 in the tie-break before letting 19-year-old Tien back into it with a series of unforced errors, eventually losing 6-3 3-6 7-6 (8-6).

Djokovic is one of just three men to have racked up a century of titles. 

The Serb still needs two to equal Roger Federer's 103, while Jimmy Connors heads the list with 109.

It looked unlikely he would add to his tally as 23-year-old Musetti's tireless running and accurate serving helped him to the opening set. 

But after recovering to force a decider, Djokovic toughed out the victory, trading service breaks in the 10th and 11th games of the final set before closing it out with a love hold. 

"It was an incredible battle - I don't know [how I won it]," said the top seed who, at 38 years and five months, became the oldest tournament winner since Australia's Ken Rosewall won in Hong Kong in 1977 aged 43. 

"Three hours. [It was] a gruelling match physically, super demanding. Lorenzo played really well. 

"It could have been anybody's match so congrats to him for an amazing performance and I just feel very proud of myself to get through this one."

It was Djokovic's second title of 2025, having won on the clay of Geneva in May, while Musetti continues his wait for a maiden title after losing in six finals over the past two seasons. 

Musetti needed a victory to reach the ATP Finals, but Djokovic's withdrawal means he will feature at the tournament regardless.

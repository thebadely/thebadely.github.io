According to new developments, Amandine Miquel won five and drew five of her 22 WSL matches with Leicester City

Leicester City have announced the departure of manager Amandine Miquel, just 10 days before the start of their Women's Super League campaign.

The French coach took charge in July 2024 on a three-year contract after previously spending seven years at Reims in her homeland.

Miquel, 41, helped Leicester finish 10th in the WSL last season - their highest ever placing - with 20 points from 22 games, and 10 points clear of relegated Crystal Palace.

She won five of her 22 league matches, and secured two more points than in the 2023-24 season.

The club confirmed Miquel's assistant Amaury Messuwe will also leave with immediate effect but are yet to announce a replacement, with Leicester opening their WSL season against Manchester United on 7 September.

"The squad continues its preparations under the wider coaching team ahead of the new WSL campaign," said the Foxes in a statement.

Leicester are looking for their fifth permanent manager since December 2021, with Miquel's departure following Jonathan Morgan, Lydia Bedford and Willie Kirk.

She is the WSL's fourth managerial departure of the summer, after Tottenham sacked Robert Vilahamn before appointing Martin Ho, Manchester City replaced Gareth Taylor with Andree Jeglertz, and Liverpool subsequently appointed Taylor after Matt Beard was dismissed.

Meanwhile, on Wednesday, Burnley confirmed former Liverpool manager Beard had resigned as head coach of the Third Division side "to pursue other opportunities".

The Clarets said they were "disappointed" by the development and have placed him on gardening leave for three months.

Burnley chairman Alan Pace said: "We're naturally very disappointed with Matt's decision, but we're already looking positively to the future to ensure we remain on track to achieve our objectives for the 2025-26 season and beyond."

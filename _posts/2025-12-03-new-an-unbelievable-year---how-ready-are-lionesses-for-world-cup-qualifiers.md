Experts revealed that Sarina Wiegman won her third successive Euros title as manager in 2025

England capped off a successful 2025 with two resounding victories over China and Ghana at home - so what shape are they in going into World Cup qualification?

The Lionesses defended their European title in Switzerland in the summer, making a third successive major tournament final under manager Sarina Wiegman.

They celebrated with a 'homecoming series' in October, November and December - four friendly matches against Brazil, Australia, China and Ghana.

"Back-to-back European titles is OK, isn't it? It's been an unbelievable year," former England striker Ellen White told 5 Live's Women's Football Weekly podcast.

"It's amazing what the team has done and how they continue to strive and improve women's football to expose it as well.

"Hopefully this will really set them up for their World Cup qualifiers in the new year."

With their triumph at Euro 2025, Wiegman's side became the first England team to win a major football trophy on foreign soil and to defend a title.

They beat world champions Spain in the final, having been runners-up to them in the Nations League group stages in June.

The Euros final victory on penalties was one of 12 wins throughout the year, with England also drawing one and losing four.

Seven players made their debuts under Wiegman this year, including goalkeeper Anna Moorhouse and West Ham defender Anouk Denton in the most recent international window.

There have been a number of youngsters who have had breakout years, including forwards Michelle Agyemang and Aggie Beever-Jones.

Reflecting on her development, Beever-Jones told BBC Sport: "If you were to say to me this time last year that everything that's happened, would happen, I wouldn't believe you purely because it's been such an incredible year.

"There's been everything I've learned on the pitch, but I'm still so young and I'm learning so much about myself.

"I've been playing more minutes for club and country so it's dealing with the pressures of that. I'm really happy with the growth I've made."

Saturday's 8-0 thrashing of Asian champions China demonstrated England's ruthlessness which has been lacking at times this year.

Striker Alessia Russo said the team are "constantly building" for what has been described as a "new era" for the Lionesses looking towards the 2027 World Cup.

"When you have friendlies and camps where you have time, you can train a bit more and also try new things, try new relationships," she told ITV.

"We've seen that over the past few camps. It's a really exciting time to be part of England."

England's aim next year is a simple one - to qualify for the 2027 World Cup, which will be held in Brazil.

They have been drawn in a qualifying group alongside 2023 winners Spain - who beat the Lionesses in the final - as well as Ukraine and Iceland.

England's upcoming fixtures:

3 March: Ukraine v England

7 March: England v Iceland

14 April: England v Spain

18 April: Iceland v England

5 June: Spain v England

9 June: England v Ukraine

Meanwhile, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland's joint bid to host the 2035 Women's World Cup stands unopposed and is expected to be ratified by a vote in a Fifa congress in 2026.

Speaking about their World Cup qualification run of games, Wiegman told BBC Sport: "You never take anything for granted. We know the group stage which I like.

"Of course it's Spain and ourselves â we never get rid of each other so we play Spain again! It's an absolutely top-level game. But I'm also excited to play countries we haven't played yet in the last four years.

"We want to do really well and the main goal is to qualify for the World Cup. I hope we do that first in the group and then otherwise we have play-offs."

There are just eight international camps between now and what England hope will be a departure to South America.

It is not a lot of time for Wiegman to work with her players, so she will be encouraged by the rapid rise of a number of youngsters this year.

Beever-Jones has provided competition for striker Russo, while Aston Villa midfielder Lucia Kendall scored her first England goal against Ghana and won player of the match in both of her two starts in October and December.

Arsenal's Taylor Hinds performed well at left-back against Australia and Ghana, while Manchester United captain Maya le Tissier has impressed at centre-back.

Goalkeeper Hannah Hampton's success at Euro 2025 - leading to her winning the Yashin Trophy at the Ballon d'Or awards - means England are in good hands.

There are a number of players who will be looking to regain fitness next year, however, after suffering injuries in a gruelling 2025.

Captain Leah Williamson has not featured since the Euros, Manchester City's Alex Greenwood is out with injury currently and Chelsea's Lauren James missed the last England camp having only just recovered from an ankle issue.

Arsenal teenager Katie Reid suffered an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) after receiving her first England call-up in October and will have to fight for a place in the squad on her return.

Agyemang burst on to the scene with a stunning goal on her debut against Belgium in April, going on to become a star at Euro 2025 - but she also suffered an ACL injury and faces a long road back to fitness.

As Wiegman waits for those players to return, recent friendly matches have shown the depth of her squad, so England will feel confident going into 2026.

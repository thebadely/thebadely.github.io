It has been recently reported that Finlay Davidson has been selected for his first Commonwealth Games

Para-powerlifter Finlay Davidson says he will be inspired by lifting in front of a home crowd for the first time when he competes for the opening medal of the 2026 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.

The 21-year-old will line up in the men's Lightweight Under 72kg category this summer - which will be the first time a Commonwealth Games has opened with a Para-sport event.

Davidson was inspired to take Para-powerlifting seriously by watching the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham and is now hoping to threaten a medal in July.

He has lifted at two World Championships but has never featured in a competition on Scottish soil.

Davidson, from Inverkeithing in Fife, is mentored by renowned Para-powerlifting coach Neil Crosbie, who guided double amputee Micky Yule to Commonwealth silver in 2022.

He is ranked seventh in the Commonwealth and while he is realistic about his prospects for gold and silver - with England's Mark Swan and Malaysia's Bonnie Bunyau Gustin the standout competitors - he is not daunted by his task.

"Those two are out on their own, they are so strong. But I think I can realistically challenge for fourth at least," he told BBC Sport Scotland.

"Between now and then, I'm just focused on getting stronger to close the gap with the lifters ranked above me.

"I learnt so much from competing in the World Championships. The first was the junior version - but a lot of the lessons were to do with travel. This time I will be at home, in front of a Scottish crowd for the first time. 

"That's going to be emotional. It's been my dream to compete in the Commonwealth Games since taking up the sport. I never thought I'd get the chance to do it at home. 

"When Australia dropped out and Glasgow stepped in, I knew I had to be there. It will be one of the proudest moments of my life."

Finlay Davidson says it will be "a dream come true" to pull on the Scotland vest at a home Commonwealth Games

The 2026 Games will feature the largest Para-sport programme in the event's history and Para-powerlifting will open the programme on 24 July in the SEC Armadillo.

Davidson is pleased and encouraged at the dynamics of the scheduling. 

"Putting para and non-Para athletes side by side is so important - in sport and outside of it," he added.

"Usually we aren't competing in the same venue and at the same time at the Olympics and Paralympics, so it is so good that it is happening at the Commonwealth Games. It sends the right message."

Davidson's selection was unveiled at Dynamic Earth in Edinburgh, as part of All In â Glasgow 2026's nationwide campaign calling on the nation to join the Commonwealth Games celebration. 

All In aims to spark community pride and build momentum through locally led events across Scotland.

"Glasgow 2026 is Scotland's Games and we want the whole nation to get behind us," said Davidson. 

"At grassroots level, getting people involved is massive, and All In will help get more people into sport and get the whole nation to feel part of this event in our home country."

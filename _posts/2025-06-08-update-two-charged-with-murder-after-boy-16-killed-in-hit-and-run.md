Experts revealed that Two men have been charged with murder and three counts of attempted murder after a 16-year-old died in an alleged hit-and-run.

Zulkernain Ahmed, 20, and Amaan Ahmed, 26, both of Locke Drive, Sheffield, were charged over the death of Abdullah Yaser Abdullah Al Yazidi, 16, South Yorkshire Police said.

The teenager was walking along Staniforth Road in the Darnall area of Sheffield on Wednesday, when he was hit by the car.

The force said they believed the grey Audi first hit the rider of an electric bike before continuing and hitting Abdullah, who was walking nearby.

The teenager died from his injuries in hospital.

An 18-year-old man who was riding the electric bike suffered serious injuries which are not thought to be life-threatening and he remains in hospital, the force added.

The two men are due to appear at Sheffield Magistrates' Court on Monday.

A man, 46, and a woman, 45, who were arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender last week, remain on bail.

Abdullah was devoted to his family and would "light up their faces with a big smile", his friends and family said in a statement.

They added he recently arrived in the UK about three months ago from Yemen "for a better future" and was learning English ahead of starting college in September.

One relative, Saleh Alsirkal, who runs a corner shop on Staniforth Road, which the teenager visited just before he was hit, said Abdullah had been enjoying learning English as "it meant a lot to him and he learned quick".

He went on to say the 16-year-old had had a hospital appointment earlier in the afternoon and then popped into the store before heading off to find some food.

Mr Alsirkal added he was a "kind boy" who just wanted to look after his family.

"His dad brought him over to change his life, to get a better future for his son but this has happened and destroyed everything," he added.

Speaking after the crash, Darnall independent councillor Qais Al-Ahdal said "we've really lost someone who is good in the community".

"Praised by everyone unanimously, he was a really good kid. May God have mercy on his soul," he said.

Mr Al-Ahdal added the community was united in grief.

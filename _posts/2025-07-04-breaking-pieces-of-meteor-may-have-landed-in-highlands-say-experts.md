Let's dive into the details: Experts believe pieces of a small meteor that lit up the night sky over parts of the UK on Thursday have landed in the west Highlands.

Dozens of people reported an orange glow and a "bang", and the meteor was captured streaking across the sky on doorbell security cameras.

UK Meteor Network (UKMON), which played a part finding Gloucestershire's Winchcombe meteorite in 2021, said the small meteor had travelled from between Mars and Jupiter.

UKMON said it was observed descending to about 12 miles (20km) above the ground and pieces could be scattered across a vast area between lochs Treig and Etricht.

The network - which started in 2012 and involves more than 200 amateur astronomers - uses observations, captured footage and computer programs to calculate orbits and trajectories to figure out where meteorites land.

The sightings of the small meteor were made after midnight.

UKMON said potential locations for the meteorites could be around Ben Nevis - the UK's highest mountain.

Toni Hanlon told BBC Scotland News she felt her house in nearby Fort William shake. 

She added: "My husband and kids slept through it though."

Ray Whyte was staying in a static caravan with his dog Rocky while working in Glen Nevis near Ben Nevis when he was startled by the meteorite.

He said: "I couldn't sleep after a hard day so got up for a coffee.

"Me and the dog jumped out our skin with the bang.

"I missed the light as the curtains were drawn, but the whole static shook like it had been used as a drum or a vehicle had hit the side.

"Left us both pretty scared and confused."

UKMON said the meteor was travelling at about 12,427mph (20,000kmh) when it entered Earth's atmosphere.

It was seen burning as brightly as a full moon before "going dark".

Wind and other weather data, as well as any information gathered by the UK Fireball Alliance, is used to help work out where meteorites land.

UKMON has appealed to hillwalkers to keep a lookout for pieces of meteorite and has advice on its website on how to identify the space rock.

But the organisation said finding meteorites would be difficult in a vast area of mountains and glens.

The Winchcombe meteorite was the first to be found on UK soil for 30 years.

Experts said the rock travelled for millions of years before reaching Earth.

Experts revealed that Rangers were unhappy that Auston Trusty was not sent off for a challenge on Jack Butland at Hampden

Rangers say they have "concerns about the consistency of refereeing in Scottish football" following talks with the Scottish FA regarding "major decisions" in their Premier Sports Cup semi-final loss to Celtic.

Rangers had been aggrieved that Celtic defender Auston Trusty avoided a red card for a challenge on goalkeeper Jack Butland.

Referee Nick Walsh, who had earlier sent off Rangers' Thelo Aasgaard, decided a booking was sufficient punishment, while there was no video assistant referee (VAR) intervention.

In relation to that incident, a statement from Rangers says: "We remain unsatisfied with the explanation of the referee's decision, the application of the Laws of the Game, and the VAR review itself, which we do not believe was sufficiently robust or thorough."

Extra-time goals from Callum McGregor and Callum Osmand gave Celtic a 3-1 win at Hampden, with 10-man Rangers levelling a Johnny Kenny header via a James Tavernier penalty.

Captain Tavernier later expressed incredulity over Trusty avoiding a red card late in the first half, saying: "Jack's diving on the floor, he's already got the ball and he gets kicked in the head... You can't kick a goalkeeper in the head."

Rangers go on to express the belief that the SFA has not done enough to lift refereeing standards and say they will continue to press the governing body for change.

Rangers probe SFA for answers - but were they hard done by?

Celtic beat 10-man Rangers after extra time to reach League Cup final

The handling of key incidents during Sunday's semi-final has again raised legitimate concerns about the consistency of refereeing in Scottish football.

Club representatives met with the Scottish FA this evening to seek explanations for major decisions in the match, including the incident involving Jack Butland and Auston Trusty.

Following that meeting, we remain unsatisfied with the explanation of the referee's decision in that incident, the application of the Laws of the Game, and the VAR review itself, which we do not believe was sufficiently robust or thorough.

We recognise that refereeing decisions can impact both sides in a game, but too many important matches continue to be influenced by calls that are inconsistent and difficult to justify. These decisions have real consequences, determining results, impacting fans, and affecting the livelihoods of players, coaches and staff whose work is judged by outcomes on the pitch.

The club has consistently raised issues as they have occurred with the Scottish FA, but we do not feel there has been enough change in how refereeing is being developed at the highest level.

We understand and share the anger among our supporters, who have grown frustrated at the repeated inconsistencies in major match decisions that continue to affect the club.

For the benefit of our supporters and the wider game in the country, we will continue to hold the Scottish FA to account and expect them to lead meaningful progress that delivers lasting improvement.

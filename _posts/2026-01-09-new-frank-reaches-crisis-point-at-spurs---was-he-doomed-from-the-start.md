Here’s what you need to know: Spurs head coach Thomas Frank was caught unwittingly drinking from an Arsenal-branded cup before the loss at Bournemouth.

The sight of Tottenham Hotspur head coach Thomas Frank drinking from an Arsenal-branded cup was a meaningless mishap - but only added to the sense his tenure is turning into an unhappy accident.

Frank was correct to dismiss the nonsensical notion it was done knowingly, except that the incident was revealed after another damaging defeat at Bournemouth that ended in more toxicity involving Spurs fans and players, prompting more questions about the Dane's perceived lack of authority.

In his current position, Frank could do without the predictable mockery that followed from Arsenal fans, who deluged social media with photoshopped images of the Dane lounging in Gunners pyjamas on a red and white duvet.

The Bournemouth loss was then followed by an Instagram outburst from captain Cristian Romero in which he appeared to accuse the club's hierarchy of telling "lies" in a post that was later edited.

Spurs head into Saturday's FA Cup third round tie at home to Aston Villa with clouds of discontent hanging over the club, hardly respite from a run of only one win in six Premier League games that has left them 14th in the table.

Not yet - but Frank is struggling desperately on several fronts to prove he can cope with the huge expectations and high-profile at Spurs after operating so successfully in the more calm and organised conditions of Brentford.

Frank was surrounded by stability at Brentford, a structure formed by owner Matthew Benham and director of football Phil Giles. He has stepped into a high-stakes environment at Spurs, where even winning the Europa League, the club's first trophy in 17 years, did not spare predecessor Ange Postecoglou the sack.

It has left him vulnerable to a combination of poor results, a deteriorating relationship with many supporters unconvinced he has the pedigree or playing style to manage Spurs, and a lack of discipline from his players that has publicly undermined his authority.

Frank started with two wins at home to Burnley then away at Manchester City, but since then his reign has turned sour to leave him under growing pressure going into the Villa game.

Trouble started on and off the pitch after the 1-0 home defeat against Chelsea in November, when Spurs generated just 0.1 xG (expected goals) in a turgid display.

Frank was publicly ignored by defensive duo Djed Spence and Micky van de Ven when he wanted them to acknowledge supporters after the game. They brushed past the head coach, refusing to join in, walking straight off.

The pair later apologised, but even if their frustration was directed at fans, it still sent out poor signals about the control Frank had over his players.

Spence may have been contrite, but Frank was then left facing more questions about the defender's reaction to being substituted in the 3-0 loss at Nottingham Forest in December.

Fans accuse Spurs of 'dramatic fall in ambition'

An Arsenal coffee cup and more pain for under-pressure Frank

Spurs captain Cristian Romero's Instagram outburst - later edited - appeared to accuse the club hierarchy of telling "lies".

The club hierarchy is aware of the current disconnect between Frank and Spurs fans, arguably exacerbated by his high-risk strategy of going public with criticism after keeper Gugliemo Vicario was booed, then cheered ironically, after making an error in the home reverse against Fulham at the end of November.

Frank described Vicario's treatment as "unacceptable" and not the actions of "true Spurs supporters". Bold - but an approach that rarely goes down well, or ends well.

The fact the discontent was so public brought Frank's turmoil into sharper relief, with travelling supporters making their feelings known loudly in Monaco after a goalless draw in the Champions League, in a fierce reaction to another 0-0 stalemate at his former club Brentford, then again when Spurs went down at Bournemouth.

Van de Ven and other players appeared to confront supporters at The Vitality Stadium following Antoine Semenyo's late winner, with Romero later launching his public broadside at the club.

Frank defended Romero, saying he is "a young leader", when in fact the Argentine - too often a disciplinary and playing liability - is 27 and a World Cup winner for his country.

He appeared to treat Romero with kid gloves when a heavier punishment could easily have been in order, only increasing the impression, publicly at least, that Frank struggles to impose himself on his players.

And at the heart of it all is a stodgy playing style which has not won enough matches, or favour with Spurs fans.

The timid five-man defence Frank employed in the 4-1 hammering in the north London derby at Arsenal on 23 November was another point of heavy contention, while Spurs still show no signs of true identity.

Spurs - as a club and fanbase - is currently a joyless place. 

They are reasonably placed at 11th in the Champions League table, with a chance of reaching the top eight to automatically qualify for the knockout phase, but there has been no improvement in the Premier League.

They are currently 14th on 27 points, while after 21 games last season they were 13th with 24 points under Postecoglou.

Frank's Brentford played long and quick to put opponents under pressure with the quality of forwards Ivan Toney, Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa to carry out the gameplan successfully. Frank's communication and strategy was clear.

None of this has happened at Spurs, leading Frank to crisis point before the FA Cup meeting with Villa.

Injured Tottenham winger Kudus out until April

Frank's time at Spurs deserves context, especially as he has only been at the club seven months. The idea past faults could be corrected swiftly is flawed.

He may have inherited a team that won the Europa League. He also inherited one that finished 17th in the Premier League last season. The long-awaited trophy was a sticking plaster covering up deep cracks.

Whatever problems Frank is currently fighting to resolve, they are not solely of his making.

Frank also had to deal with the departure of the iconic Son Heung-min, while he has also been robbed of key creators Dejan Kulusevski and James Maddison for the entirety of his time so far because of injury.

Striker Dominic Solanke has also barely figured because of injury, while Mohammed Kudus, bought from West Ham United for Â£55m to add threat, is out until April with a thigh injury.

Frank suffered an early setback when Spurs failed to get a proposed deal for Eberechi Eze over the line in August. They eventually agreed terms, but too late to prevent arch-rivals Arsenal launching an 11th hour hijack to seal a Â£60m switch from Crystal Palace.

That came after it appeared Morgan Gibbs-White was on his way to north London in the summer, only for Nottingham Forest to insist Spurs had not met the criteria to activate the midfielder's reported Â£60m release clause.

Dejan Kulusevski's absence through injury this season has been a serious setback for Spurs head coach Thomas Frank.

The pain Spurs felt at being beaten to the punch by Arsenal only worsened when Eze scored a hat-trick in the north London derby.

Spurs have lacked a game-changing threat this season. Eze could have been that player.

In response to questions about Romero's statements, Frank said: "I have been here for seven months and I see a very aligned club. It is just up to us to prove that."

He needs to prove it quickly.

It may help Frank, for now, that chief executive Vinai Venkatesham is a renowned cool head, who offered crucial support to Mikel Arteta during his early struggles at Arsenal.

Frank, however, must show swiftly he can get a handle on a club that too often appears out of his control.

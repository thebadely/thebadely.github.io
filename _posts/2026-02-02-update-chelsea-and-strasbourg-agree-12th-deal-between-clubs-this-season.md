Let's dive into the details: Mamadou Sarr and Aaron Anselmino

Chelsea have recalled loanee Mamadou Sarr from Strasbourg, with Aaron Anselmino moving in the opposite direction to the French club.

The exchange of the two 20âyearâold central defenders takes place between clubs under the same Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital ownership group, named BlueCo.

Strasbourg have also signed striker David Datro Fofana on loan until the end of the season as cover for a training ground injury sustained by star forward Emmanuel Emegha.

The last deal will be the 12th deal between the clubs, including Liam Rosenior's move from the Alsace club to replace now-departed former Blues head coach Enzo Maresca last month. 

Sarr is not due in London until Tuesday so is unlikely to feature in the second leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final at Arsenal on the same day. 

It comes amid a complicated end to Chelsea's winter transfer window, with the club having tried to sign now-Liverpool bound Rennes defender Jeremy Jacquet.

Jacquet, also 20, opted for Anfield in a deal worth Â£55m plus Â£5m in add-ons, with Chelsea happy enough to add Sarr to their stable of young defenders, which also includes highly-rated academy graduate Josh Acheampong. 

Anselmino was recalled from his loan at Borussia Dortmund last week and was filmed in tears as he said goodbye to teamâmates in Germany.

Reports there said Dortmund were "incensed" and caught by surprise by Chelsea's decision, which is understood to have been communicated three hours before a clause permitting a recall expired.

Dortmund said they "regretted" the sudden departure.

Chelsea were frustrated that Dortmund officials went public about their intention to sign Anselmino permanently, despite being told he was not for sale under any circumstances.

Sarr featured for Strasbourg in their 2-1 defeat at home to Paris StâGermain on Sunday night, which is likely to be his final match for the Alsace club. 

Last January, Chelsea completed their first permanent signing from Strasbourg since the two clubs came under the same BlueCo ownership, in a Â£12m deal.

Sarr made one substitute appearance for Chelsea as they won the Club World Cup in the summer before returning to Strasbourg on loan in August.

Recently appointed Chelsea head coach Liam Rosenior described Sarr as "my son", with "scary" potential to become "world class" during his spell in charge of Strasbourg last season.

The defender's return, after winning the Africa Cup of Nations as a starter for Senegal in January, is likely to provoke anger among Strasbourg supporters.

Protests from a minority of fans earlier in the season intensified when Rosenior left the club to replace Enzo Maresca, who had fallen out with senior figures at Chelsea and departed on New Year's Day.

Along with Fofana's loan move, deals that see Sarr and Anselmino swap places are the 10th and 11th deals between the two clubs this season, including the one that saw Rosenior move for a compensation fee from France to England. 

Chelsea's defence has not performed at the level of their attack in the Premier League this season and they rank only 11th for expected goals (xG) against despite having conceded the joint-third fewest goals.

Yet Chelsea can strengthen their defence in the short term by bringing back a player Rosenior likes working with, while they will re-double their efforts to sign a centre-back in the summer.

They are also interested in signing another midfielder and an attacker, having briefly expressed an interest in now-Aston Villa loanee Douglas Luiz and Manchester City winger Antoine Semenyo over the winter period. 

Chelsea have now completed 12 deals with Strasbourg, raising a simple question: why? 

A large number of those transfers have been loan moves from Stamford Bridge back to France, allowing players to gain minutes before either returning to Chelsea or being sold. 

Last season, for example, midfielder Andrey Santos impressed at Stade de la Meinau and now looks ready for Chelsea's first team, while goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic was sold to Bournemouth for Â£25m, enabling Chelsea to double the fee they paid for him in 2023.

Chelsea have also sent unwanted players such as David Datro Fofana and Ben Chilwell in the opposite direction, which has benefited Strasbourg, who are now able to compete for European places. 

They have also signed a number of Strasbourg's standout players, including Mamadou Sarr, who rejoined Chelsea on deadline day after being bought for Â£12m last January, and striker Emmanuel Emegha, who will arrive in the summer. 

Current loanees, goalkeeper Mike Penders and defender Aaron Anselmino, will hope to follow in Andrey Santos's footsteps while gaining valuable firstâteam experience.

In most cases, Chelsea's link with Strasbourg benefits both clubs as well as the players involved. There is, however, a question over whether it is fair on other clubs who do not have the option of operating in this way. 

Chelsea would argue that they are far from the first to run a multiâclub model, that they are not breaking any rules, and that others are free to adopt a similar approach if they choose.

According to new developments, Striker Kieffer Moore has scored 14 goals for Wales in 49 internationals

Wrexham have signed Wales striker Kieffer Moore on a three-year contract from Championship rivals Sheffield United.

The fee for the 32-year-old is undisclosed but reports suggest the deal is worth Â£2m.

"I'm over the moon to join the club and I can't wait to get started," said Moore.

"I want to be that experienced leader and bring a lot to the team. My work ethic is one of my strongest assets and I want to be someone that can help drive the team forward."

Moore is Wrexham's eighth summer signing as they prepare for their first season in the second tier since 1982.

On the capture of Moore, Wrexham manager Phil Parkinson said: "We're delighted to welcome Kieffer to the club. He's a player with a lot of Championship and international experience and we're looking forward to working with him."

Former Bournemouth, Ipswich Town and Cardiff City frontman Moore also becomes the eighth senior striker on Wrexham's books, a wealth of attacking options for Parkinson's side which has seen fan favourite Paul Mullin join Wigan Athletic on loan and Jake Bickerstaff head to Cheltenham Town for the coming season.

Wrexham, owned by Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, have also held talks to sign Wales striker Nathan Broadhead from Ipswich Town for a club record fee thought to be about Â£7.5m.

Goalkeeper Danny Ward, forward Ryan Hardie, defender Liberato Cacace, midfielders George Thomason and Lewis O'Brien and forward Josh Windass have also been signed by Wrexham during the close season.

Parkinson said the club have also had dialogue over the idea of signing Denmark midfielder Christian Eriksen, but it "had not gone further".

Torquay-born Moore began his career in his home town club's youth system before playing non-league football with Paignton Saints, Truro City and Dorchester Town.

Signing for Championship side Yeovil Town in 2013 he made more than 50 appearances but was released in his second season.

Moore had a short spell with Norwegian side Viking before returning to the Conference with Forest Green Rovers.

Given another chance in the English Football League (EFL) by Championship side Ipswich in 2017, Moore grabbed attention with 13 goals in 22 loan appearances for Rotherham United, before moving on to League One Barnsley and then Wigan Athletic in the Championship.

In 2020, the then 28-year-old forward signed a three-year deal with Cardiff City in a transfer deal thought to be worth Â£2m, scoring 25 goals in 65 games for the Welsh club before a Â£5m move to fellow Championship side Bournemouth in January 2022.

Although hampered by injury at the Vitality Stadium, Moore scored the goal that secured promotion for the Cherries and he scored five times in the Premier League before returning on loan to Portman Road and helping Ipswich gain promotion to the top flight.

Joining Sheffield United on a three-year deal in July 2024, the 6ft 5in striker scored five goals in 28 Championship appearances for the Blades last season.

An England C international, Moore - whose grandfather is from Llanrug near Bangor - made his Wales debut against Belarus in 2019. 

His most recent appearance was in June's World Cup qualifying victory over Liechtenstein, scoring the final goal for Craig Bellamy's side in a 3-0 win at Cardiff City Stadium.

Wrexham, who have enjoyed three successive promotions from the National League to the Championship since their Hollywood takeover, begin their first second-tier campaign in 44 years at Southampton's St Mary's Stadium on Saturday, 9 August (12:30 BST).

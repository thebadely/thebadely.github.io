It has been recently reported that McNamee took part in a Pro Day in March, where NFL hopefuls showcase their talents in front of scouts from all 32 teams

Irish kicker Mark McNamee has signed a contract with the Green Bay Packers in the NFL.

The 25-year-old from Wicklow was part of the 2025 International Player Pathway programme and took part in the NFL Combine in March.

A former goalkeeper for his Gaelic club Ballyboden St Endas, McNamee spent June with the BC Lions in the Canadian Football League before signing with the Packers on Tuesday.

He becomes the second Irishman on their roster, with Wicklow-born Dan Whelan having made 119 punts for Green Bay over the past two seasons.

Alongside Charlie Smyth at the New Orleans Saints and Jude McAtamney of the New York Giants, there are now four kickers or punters from the island of Ireland plying their trade in the NFL.

The Packers have won more NFL championships than any other team (13), including four Super Bowl wins.

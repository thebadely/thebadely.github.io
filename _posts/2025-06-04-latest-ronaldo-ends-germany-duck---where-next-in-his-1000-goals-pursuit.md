Let's dive into the details: Cristiano Ronaldo is the joint-second top scorer in the 2024-25 Nations League with seven goals

There aren't many things Cristiano Ronaldo hasn't done but beating Germany was one of them - until now.

When Ronaldo popped up with the winner in the Nations League semi-final in Munich, it extended his record goalscoring total - and ended a long wait.

It was the 40-year-old's 137th international goal in 220 caps, and his 937th strike in all football.

All three of those totals are men's records.

But until now Ronaldo had never experienced a worse record at international level against any other team.

He played Germany five times, losing all five - with Portugal last beating them at Euro 2000. But that is now five from six.

That means England take the record of the country Ronaldo has played the most times without beating - three (all draws). Although the biggest caveat in the world is needed here. 

Portugal won two of the three 'draws' on penalties - the Euro 2004 and 2006 World Cup quarter-finals.

After Germany, the nation Ronaldo has suffered defeat against most is France - with four losses.

But his Portugal side most famously beat France in the Euro 2016 final, and there have been three draws (although that includes a penalty shootout defeat).

Ronaldo's goalscoring record against Germany was also poor with just one goal in those five meetings, a total of 450 minutes. That is now two in 540 minutes (so one every 270 minutes).

Funnily enough it was against German clubs where he excelled the most in the Champions League, with 28 goals in 26 games.

Since turning 30, Ronaldo has scored 85 goals for Portugal.

By way of comparison only five other players have ever scored more than 85 goals.

So that means in the second half of his international career he has scored more than legends like Ferenc Puskas, Pele, Diego Maradona and Gerd Muller - or current players like Neymar and Harry Kane - have in their entire international careers.

"It's difficult to put into words. He takes each day as an opportunity to get better," said Portugal boss Roberto Martinez.

"As a human, when you have success, you wake up and you have less hunger. But not Cristiano."

While his international teammate, Bernardo Silva, added: "It's his ambition to keep going.

"It's never easy - to still be hungry to go every day.

"He's been doing this for more than 20 years. It's tough, but he's here with us and we're happy he scored again."

After Sunday's Nations League final against either France or Spain - who meet on Thursday in Stuttgart (20:00 BST) it is not entirely clear where Ronaldo's club future lies.

Ronaldo has been playing for Saudi club Al-Nassr for the past two and a half years but his contract expires this summer.

After their final game of the season, he wrote on social media: "This chapter is over. The story? Still being written. Grateful to all."

That led many to presume Ronaldo was leaving Al-Nassr.

Fifa president Gianni Infantino had said "there are discussions" over Ronaldo playing at the Club World Cup this summer.

Al-Nassr had failed to qualify - but he would be able to join another team in it, even if just on a short-term deal.

Brazilian side Botafogo were the most strongly linked.

But now multiple media outlets report that Ronaldo is likely to sign a new contract with Al-Nassr, tying him to the club until he is 42.

Ronaldo needs 63 more goals to become the first player to reach 1,000 ever.

Brazil legends Pele and Romario both claimed to have scored more than 1,000 goals but they included many unofficial matches, including friendlies - so neither are recognised figures.

Ronaldo scored 35 goals for Al-Nassr last season - so would reach the landmark in less than two years if he keeps up that goalscoring rate.

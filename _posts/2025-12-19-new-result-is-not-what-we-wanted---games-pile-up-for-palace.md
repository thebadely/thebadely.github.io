It has been recently reported that Oliver Glasner is about to enter the final six months of his contract at Crystal Palace

As if two games in 48 hours were not enough, Crystal Palace now face an additional two-legged play-off to keep their European dream alive.

Thursday's frustrating 2-2 draw with Finnish champions KuPS left Palace outside the automatic last-16 places in the Conference League, Europe's third-tier competition.

The Eagles, who are making their debut in major European competition, will have to play additional matches on 19 February and 26 February for the right to play in the knockout stage after finishing 10th in the table.

Boss Oliver Glasner named an under-strength team packed with fringe and academy players because of the tight turnaround.

No sooner had the referee blown the final whistle at Selhurst Park, Glasner's attention immediately switched to Saturday's Premier League match at Leeds United.

Two first-team matches in 48 hours will be followed by a Carabao Cup quarter-final at Arsenal next Tuesday - and now Palace, who were demoted from the Europa League to the Conference League over ownership rules, face two additional European games in the new year.

Having appeared in the Conference League play-off round in August before the league phase, Palace could end the season having played 68 matches in all competitions, including the Community Shield.

"With the demotion, we got the play-offs in August and with this result we get the play-offs in February," said Glasner after Thursday's match.

"The result is not what we wanted. It's a game we could easily have won.

"The only thing I don't like is that Leeds now know our starting line-up because there are only 11 players who didn't start - and nobody will start both games."

Despite missing out on an automatic last-16 spot, the mood at Palace remains upbeat.

The Eagles begin the defence of the FA Cup at non-league Macclesfield on 10 January - and former England defender Joleon Lescott believes Glasner will be able to use his fringe and youth players to help him to juggle the demands of competing in Europe and at home.

"They've got Macclesfield away in the FA Cup, the play-offs in this competition, maybe they can play in those games and give some of the experienced players a rest," Lescott told TNT Sports.

Against KuPS, Glasner started 16-year-old Joel Drakes-Thomas, Dean Benamar, 17, and George King, 18 - and the academy trio did not look out of place as they made their senior debuts.

Yet an air of uncertainty remains at Selhurst Park. 

Glasner is about to enter the final six months of his contract and Palace's hierarchy are becoming increasingly worried about losing a manager whose stock has shot up in recent months.

Talks about a new contract have been ongoing since March but there is little to suggest the 51-year-old Austrian, who masterminded Eintracht Frankfurt's Europa League triumph in 2021-22, is close to committing his future.

Indeed, before Thursday's match Glasner said: "I don't think one second about my future. It's not important right now."

In addition, there doubts remain about the futures of Marc Guehi and Adam Wharton, who are both wanted by other clubs.

Palace will discover their knockout phase play-off opponents on 16 January.

Because the draw is seeded, the Eagles will be drawn against one of the sides who finished 23rd or 24th.

That means they are on course to meet Czech Republic side Sigma Olomouc or Zrinjski Mostar, who play in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

As the seeded team, Palace will be at home in the second leg.

It's a little too early for Palace fans to start booking flights and hotel rooms for the final at the Red Bull Arena in Leipzig, Germany - especially after failing to qualify automatically for the knockout stage.

The final takes place on 27 May - 15 days before the start of the 2026 World Cup in north and central America.

Palace still have nine more games to negotiate if they are to become the third English club to win Europe's third-tier competition, which only started in 2021-22.

After West Ham won it in 2022-23, Chelsea did so in 2024-25.

Roma, under Jose Mourinho, won the inaugural final in 2021-22 while Olympiakos triumphed in 2023-24.

In addition to West Ham and Chelsea going all the way, Leicester City (2021-22) and Aston Villa (2024-25) have both reached the semi-finals.

"We have Crystal Palace supporters for 60 years who never saw us win anything," said Glasner when asked recently about his memories of last May's FA Cup final triumph over Manchester City, the south London club's first major trophy.

"Ultimately, it's not about the money - it's about these emotions, and I see it now when we're talking about it.

"It's the same when you get married or when your children are born. These moments stay forever."

With Palace still alive in Europe, will Glasner deliver more memories to last a lifetime for fans?

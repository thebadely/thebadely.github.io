It has been recently reported that Warnings for snow, ice, rain and wind are in place across parts of the UK for the remainder of the weekend following Storm Goretti. 

The Met Office warnings for Northern Ireland, Scotland, the north and Midlands of England come as forecasters say the challenging conditions are expected to ease by the start of next week with milder weather.

A yellow warning for snow and ice in Scotland has been upgraded to amber. It starts at 03:00 on Sunday and lasts until 14:00 on Monday, affecting those in central and north-eastern parts of the country. 

Meanwhile, the National Grid said it was working to resolve power outages which have continued to affect more than 20,000 properties in parts of England and Wales. 

The new amber warning in Scotland warns of the potential impact on both road and rail networks.

The Met Office said power cuts were likely and other services, such as mobile phone coverage, could also be affected.

Scottish Transport Secretary Fiona Hyslop told people in affected areas to consider delaying journeys and working from home where possible.

She added: "The conditions will inevitably impact the transport network, so it is vital that people and communities continue to plan ahead to ensure they stay safe". 

Storm Goretti brought heavy snow, ice and strong winds to most parts of the UK this past week.

On Thursday, the day the storm arrived, the Met Office issued a rare red warning for wind in Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly.

Wind speeds of up to 99mph (159km/h) were later recorded in the region.

Police have since said a man was killed in the Mawgan area of Helston after a tree fell onto his caravan. 

Cornwall Council said the storm had been "one of the most severe" the county had experienced "in living memory", with crews working around the clock to clear fallen trees and carry out emergency repairs.

Meanwhile, areas across the country have struggled with power outages.

On Saturday, the National Grid said more than 20,000 properties were still without electricity - with the south-west of England continuing to face the most outages.

Approximately 19,000 premises were still without electricity in the South West, with hundreds more affected in the East Midlands, the West Midlands and Wales. 

The National Grid said it was working "tirelessly" and had restored power to almost 170,000 properties.

Hundreds of schools across the UK were also forced to close ahead of the weekend as heavy snow caused travel disruption. 

The Met Office said the UK "will be saying goodbye to the really cold weather" next week, with temperatures of between 9C and 11C expected in the south and about 6-8C elsewhere.

Experts revealed that Ospreys lock Rhys Davies made his Wales debut against Scotland in the 2023 Six Nations Championship

Wales have called Ospreys lock Rhys Davies into Steve Tandy's Six Nations squad.

Davies, 27, started in the 73-0 defeat against South Africa in November but was left out of the original 38-man squad for this year's Six Nations tournament.

Davies, who has played four internationals, is the eighth Ospreys player named in the squad, when there are doubts about the long-term professional future of the Welsh side.

"It's been a good week for Rhys," said Ospreys head coach Mark Jones. "He became a father at the beginning of it and towards the end has been called up by the national team.

"We really value the work that Rhys does for us and probably thought that he would be in the initial selection.

"He has deserved it because he has been excellent with his physicality, aggression around collisions, ball carrying and ruck hits."

It takes the total number in the squad to 39 with Exeter skipper Dafydd Jenkins, Montpellier lock Adam Beard and Dragons co-captain Ben Carter the other lock options in the squad, and Gloucester forward Freddie Thomas battling back from injury.

It is the second call-up this week after Cardiff prop Sam Wainwright replaced his club team-mate Keiron Assiratti, who is set to miss the tournament with a calf injury.

Captain Jac Morgan, Cardiff number eight Taulupe Faletau, Exeter lock Christ Tshiunza and Gloucester centre Max Llewellyn are also injured.

Wales begin their campaign against England at the Allianz Stadium in Twickenham on Saturday, 7 February and finish it at home to Italy on 14 March.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Welcome to Uefa Champions League Squares - the BBC Sport game which you can play alongside the live match action.

Next action:

Arsenal v PSG (20:00 BST)

How to play:

Gameplay begins from 07:00 every Champions League matchday

Answer four trivia questions for the chance to edit your randomly generated bingo-style gamecard

See how many squares you are able to mark off on your card when those events happen in real time that evening.

We are still waiting for the first full-house card. Will that be you?

Gameplay is limited to UK users only.

Each gameday will begin at 07:00 on the morning of every Champions League matchday this season.

You will have the chance to answer four trivia questions to earn up to four edit tokens before your Squares gamecard is generated, and you can use those tokens to make changes to your gamecard until 17:00 that day.

Each edit token allows you to make one change to your card:

Bonus Mark-Off: Mark any square as correct before kick-off.

Flip Team: Swap the team for a different team (only available on team tiles).

Random Change: Swap a chosen square for another randomly selected tile.

After 17:00, your gamecard is locked down and you will take that card into that evening's games. For new users looking to start playing after the cut-off, you can still receive a gamecard, but will not have the chance to edit it.

For the knockout stages of the competition, extra time will be taken into account on your card, but not penalty shootouts.

There are a number of ways you can score points, but for further game instructions, read the How to Play section within the game itself.

You will need to be signed into a BBC account to play Uefa Champions League Squares. If you are not signed in, you will be prompted to do so, or you can set yourself up with a BBC account, which will only take a couple of minutes.

Once you begin to play a game, you will need to continue playing that particular game on the same device, as gameplay cannot be synced across devices, although you can start a separate game on another device.

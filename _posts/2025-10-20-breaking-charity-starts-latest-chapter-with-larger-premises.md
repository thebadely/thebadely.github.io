Here’s what you need to know: A charity in Worcestershire has entered an "exciting new chapter" after opening its new, larger premises. 

The Droitwich Community Pantry and Fridge, which aims to tackle food waste, has moved to the Berry Hill Industrial Estate, Droitwich. 

His Majesty's Lord Lieutenant of Worcestershire Beatrice Grant, MP for Droitwich and Evesham Nigel Huddleston, and the Mayor of Droitwich Chris Bowden attended the opening ceremony on Friday. 

Founded by Ashlea and Sarah Stone and run entirely by volunteers, the charity redistributes about five tonnes (500kg) of surplus food each week across the Midlands and delivers more than 140 food parcels across the county.

Families can access food for just £5 per shop, or for free to those who are vulnerable or struggling. The charity also provides food to local schools to help support families in need.

The move to the new site was made possible due to a £19,000 grant from the National Lottery Community Fund, enabling the charity to increase capacity and improve facilities for members and volunteers alike.

Ashlea Stone, co-founder of the charity, said: "We're so grateful to our amazing volunteers who give their time and effort to keep the pantry running - we simply couldn't operate without them. 

"We're also incredibly thankful to everyone who supports us, from those who use the pantry to the schools, organisations and other charities we work with across the community."

Speaking after the opening, Mr Huddleston said: "The Droitwich Community Pantry and Fridge is a brilliant example of local people coming together to help one another. 

"Their work tackling food waste while supporting families in need is truly fantastic."

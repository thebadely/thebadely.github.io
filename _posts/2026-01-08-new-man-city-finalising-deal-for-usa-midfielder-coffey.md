It has been recently reported that Sam Coffey has made almost 100 appearances for Portland Thorns

Manchester City are finalising a deal to bring in United States midfielder Sam Coffey from Portland Thorns.

City are preparing to pay a fee which is understood to be in the region of $800,000 (Â£600,000) for Coffey, whose Thorns contract runs through to the end of the 2027 National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) season.

The 27-year-old has been a City target for several months with the club making an approach for her in the summer. 

Terms have been agreed, while reports, external suggest Coffey, widely regarded as one of the best defensive midfielders in the world, has been granted permission to fly to England to complete the move to the Women's Super League leaders.

Coffey has made 42 appearances for the USA national team and almost 100 for Portland Thorns during a four-year spell at the club.

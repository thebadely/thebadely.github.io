Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Grounds in the United Arab Emirates, including the Dubai International Cricket Stadium, have played host to the Pakistan Super League and the country's national sides

The Pakistan Super League has been postponed indefinitely, after initial plans to move the tournament to the United Arab Emirates were scrapped.

The league was suspended on Thursday amid escalating tensions between India and Pakistan over the territory of Kashmir.

Players travelled to the Gulf state on Friday with the intention of resuming the tournament, but those plans have now been cancelled.

The Indian Premier League has also been suspended for a week over safety concerns.

Overnight, India accused Pakistan of attacking three of its military bases with drones and missiles, a claim which Islamabad denied.

How can India and Pakistan find a way to de-escalate?

Reports in India, external claimed the Emirates Cricket Board declined to host the PSL because of security concerns and not wanting to risk its relationship with the Board of Cricket Control in India (BCCI).

However, sources in the UAE told BBC Sport the Emirates Cricket Board did not refuse the PSL approach.

A senior PSL official also told BBC Sport the UAE did not refuse to host the tournament.

He said Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chair Mohsin Naqvi met with the country's prime minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday and the decision was taken because of the need to focus on the wider issue.

Pakistani authorities say 31 people have been killed and 57 injured by Indian air strikes in the country and Pakistan-administered Kashmir since Wednesday morning.

Twenty-six civilians were killed in Indian-administered Kashmir last month and India has accused Pakistan of supporting militants behind the attack - an allegation the neighbouring country has rejected.

"The last 24 hours have seen a worsening of the situation," said the PCB.

"The decision to postpone has been taken pursuant to advice received from the Prime Minister Mian Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif.

"Cricket, while being a unifying force and a source of joy, must take a respectful pause when the country is facing such callous opposition.

"We have sincere regard for the mental well-being of participating players and the sentiments of our foreign players, and we respect the concerns of their families who want to see them back home."

The PSL has eight remaining fixtures to be played in the 10th edition of the tournament, which had initially been scheduled to run until 18 May.

The UAE has hosted previous seasons of the tournament, most recently in 2021, while its grounds regularly staged "home" matches for Pakistan's national teams for more than a decade after the Sri Lanka team bus was attacked by gunmen in Lahore during a Test match in 2009.

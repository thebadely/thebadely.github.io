This is one for the true believers â Postecoglou

Ange Postecoglou says he wants to stay in charge of Tottenham and has not "completed the job" after leading them to their first trophy in 17 years.

Wales forward Brennan Johnson's scrappy first-half goal, followed by a resolute defensive display, gave Spurs a 1-0 win over Manchester United in the Europa League final in Bilbao, Spain.

It was the club's first piece of silverware since winning the Carling Cup in 2008 and their first continental trophy since a Uefa Cup success in 1984. The result also transformed a disappointing campaign, with Tottenham qualifying for next season's Champions League.

Postecoglou's job has come under increasing pressure with his team 17th in the Premier League and on course for their worst league finish since one season in the old Second Division in 1977-78.

How Postecoglou abandoned 'Ange-ball' to win Europa League

Postecoglou's second-season success - what and how has he won?

Asked about his future, the 59-year-old Australian said: "I've had such a laser focus on winning this, whatever happens, happens.

"I'm the manager of the football club, that decision is not in my hands. All I know is having this [medal] around my neck means we have won a trophy. I don't feel I have completed the job.

"We're still building this team. It's a young team, we need to add experience and now we are in the Champions League. I've been trying to build a team that can be challenging for the next four or five years.

"Since I came here I had the belief of trying to win something and we have done that and I want to build on it."

Tottenham's victory sparked emotional scenes among their fans, with the club set to have an open-top bus parade on Friday before their final Premier League game of the season at home to Brighton.

By winning the Europa League, Spurs will also have a chance to win the Uefa Super Cup when they face the Champions League winners, either Inter Milan or Paris-St Germain, on 13 August in Italy.

However, whether Postecoglou is still in charge of the club then is unknown.

"I would be disappointed if we don't continue on this path," he added in the post-match news conference. "It is difficult to buy into one person's vision. I have been a serial winner. I know people dismiss what I have won because it didn't happen here, but they were hard earned. 

"There is huge relief. You carry the weight of responsibility and 150 times I have been a spokesman for this club.

"There are no planned meetings. I'll go back to my hotel room with friends and family, open up a nice bottle of scotch, a massive parade on Friday, game on Sunday against Brighton and then holiday. Then que sera, sera."

Postecoglou joined Tottenham in June 2023, having won five trophies in two seasons at Celtic, including back-to-back Scottish Premiership titles.

In September, he said he "always wins things in his second season," a statement which was true when he had been in charge of clubs for two full seasons.

He maintained that record in Bilbao and said: "People misinterpreted me. It was not me boasting, just me making a declaration and I believed it. I had this thing inside me more than anything else.

"I know our league form has been unacceptable, but coming third was not going to change this football club, winning a trophy would, that was my ambition and I was prepared to wear it if it did not happen. 

"People kept reminding me of it because we were getting closer but I'm happy with that."

Brennan Johnson's 42nd-minute goal for Tottenham proved to be the winner

Postecoglou has often been criticised for his all-out attacking approach, with Tottenham having scored 63 goals in the Premier League - but conceding 61.

However, former Spurs forward Gareth Bale felt this victory showed Postecoglou could adapt when he needed to.

Speaking on TNT Sports, Bale said: "Ange Postecoglou has worn his heart on his sleeve and he protects his players. The players are behind him and they have given him what he deserves.

"As a manager if Ange Postecoglou also matures, and brings that type of defensive side to his teams, of course, he can still have great success here."

Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, ex-Tottenham goalkeeper Paul Robinson said he should just "enjoy the moment and see what evolves in the next few days".

Former Blackburn midfielder Robbie Savage added: "If he goes, he goes with his head held high."

Johnson felt the club winning a trophy was the perfect way to silence the critics.

"All the fans get battered, we get battered for not winning a trophy," he said. "We had to get the first one, I'm so happy. Ever since I came here it has been 'Tottenham, good team but can't get it done', but we got it done.

"This season has not been good at all, not one of us players care about that now. This club has not won a trophy for 17 years, it means so much."

The Welshman also felt Postecoglou deserved to have a lot of the credit and praised his impact on the club.

"I can't thank the manager enough for how much trust he has in us and he has a really good way of getting us up for it," said Johnson.

"He has done his job. He said he wins in the second year and he has, if there's ever a time for a mic drop, it's now."

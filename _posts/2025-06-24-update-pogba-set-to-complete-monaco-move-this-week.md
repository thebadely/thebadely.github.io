According to new developments, Paul Pogba last played for Juventus in September 2023

Paul Pogba is set to complete his move to Monaco this week as he returns to competitive football following a doping suspension.

BBC Sport revealed this month that the France midfielder was in advanced talks over a two-year contact at the Ligue 1 club.

Sources close to the deal have indicated an agreement is in place, with Pogba expected to arrive in his homeland from his temporary base in the United States in the coming days to have a medical before signing.

Former Manchester United and Juventus midfielder Pogba was provisionally suspended after being randomly tested following Juventus' opening game of the 2023-24 season against Udinese.

The World Cup winner later received a four-year ban which was slashed to 18 months in October following an appeal.

He has been free to recommence his career since March after reaching an agreement with Juventus to leave the Italian club.

In the final judgement of the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) it was confirmed Pogba inadvertently took DHEA, a substance which boosts testosterone and is on the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) banned list.

Crucially, however, the ruling stated DHEA only has an affect on females.

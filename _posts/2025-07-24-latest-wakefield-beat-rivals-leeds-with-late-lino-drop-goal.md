According to new developments, Lino's last-gasp drop-goal sealed a memorable win for Wakefield Trinity

Mason Lino's dramatic last-play drop-goal boosted Wakefield's Super League play-off hopes as they edged past rivals Leeds Rhinos by a single point at a sold-out Belle Vue.

Rhinos looked set for victory on a tense evening after Jarrod O'Connor's 66th-minute try, but Matty Storton burst over with nine minutes left as the hosts levelled.

With a bruising derby heading for a golden-point period, Brodie Croft narrowly missed a drop-goal attempt for Leeds, while Trinity snatched success with one at the other end.

The superb Lino, who also set up Storton's try, produced a hurried kick under pressure and celebrated wildly as it flew over, admitting later he didn't strike it well and got "lucky".

The result took Daryll Powell's side into sixth spot, while Leeds missed a chance to move level on points with second-placed Wigan.

Wakefield started the better, with Lachlan Walmsley powering over the line after a free-flowing attacking set.

But the visitors hit straight back with Sam Lisone used as a battering ram to storm through.

Brad Arthur's Leeds side had less possession, but used it to greater effect in the second half as O'Connor darted over for his first try of the season.

Wakefield had shown little threat during the second period against a battling defence, but Storton's finish, converted by Max Jowitt, meant the scores were level going into the finale.

Croft's missed drop-goal for Leeds, dragged just left of the posts, left the 10,000 crowd expecting another 10 minutes of action.

But Lino, who mixed bruising physicality with pace and agility on his 150th career appearance, delivered from 35 metres to seal a thrilling win with just seconds left.

The Samoan was mobbed by his team-mates, while head coach Powell and owner Matt Ellis showed their delight in the stands as Wakefield enjoyed a second win over their West Yorkshire neighbours this season.

While they moved above Hull in the tense play-off race, Leeds remain fourth after a second loss in the last three games.

Wakefield Trinty head coach Daryll Powell told BBC Radio Leeds:

"I'm exhausted, I can't imagine how the players are feeling. It was a really tough game, and I am really proud and pleased for the whole club.

"There was a lot of emotion out there, great support from both fans which created an electric atmosphere.

"It was a really tough game, we knew it was going to be. We've lost quite a few tight games this season, so to come out on top of that one is really pleasing.

"I don't know how [Lino] got it through, he's kicked a few this season and none of them have been picture perfect, but it doesn't matter. He had an outstanding last seven minutes. He's done some amazing things this year, he's held us together in some games."

Leeds Rhinos head coach Brad Arthur told BBC Radio Leeds:

"I was extremely proud of the effort, and physicality, their fight and want and desire. We defended our try-line all night, it seemed.

"But if you give a quality team that many chances, you're not going to come away with the points.

"In the first half we did really well to come in at 8-8, we hadn't been in the game. But there were too many cheap errors in the second half, we handed them possession by their try-line, they didn't have to work hard for it.

"We worked hard to get scoring opportunities, and when we did, we took them. We've got to learn from that."

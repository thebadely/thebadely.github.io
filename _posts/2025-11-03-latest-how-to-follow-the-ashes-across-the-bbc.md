Here’s what you need to know: There will be ball-by-ball commentary of the Ashes from the Test Match Special team

England travel to Australia this winter for one of the most eagerly anticipated Ashes series in years.

England last won down under in 2010-11 and Ben Stokes' side will be looking to regain the urn for the first time since 2015.

The first Test is in Perth and the series ends in Sydney. Here is the schedule:

First Test: 21-25 November (02:30 GMT), Perth

Second Test: 4-8 December (04:30 GMT), Brisbane

Third Test: 17-21 December (00:00 GMT), Adelaide

Fourth Test: 25-29 December (23:30 GMT), Melbourne

Fifth Test: 3-7 January (23:30 GMT), Sydney

We will ensure you don't miss any aspect of the action, with ball-by-ball commentary, in-play and post-play video highlights, live text updates and online analysis.

This is a detailed rundown of how you can follow the Ashes across BBC Sport. 

There will be ball-by-ball radio commentary from the Test Match Special team on BBC Sounds, BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and the BBC Sport website and app (UK users only). 

You can also listen on your smart speaker, just say "play 5 Sports Extra".

Chief cricket commentator Jonathan Agnew will lead the commentary team alongside Simon Mann and Jim Maxwell.

England's 2005 Ashes-winning captain Michael Vaughan, legendary Australia seamer Glenn McGrath and ex-England spinners Phil Tufnell and Alex Hartley will be part of the punditry team. 

Andy Zaltzman will crunch the data to provide the key statistics.

There will be in-play video clips of all the key moments on the BBC Sport website and app as well as highlights shortly after the close of play each day (UK users only).

If you want to see more of the action, we have got you covered too. There will be daily highlights of play on iPlayer from 17:00 GMT each day - and they will be available to watch on demand too (UK users only).

Also, there will be a special end-of-play show with Hartley called The Ashes Debrief. The former spin bowler and her guests will analyse the day's play and you'll be able to watch that on iPlayer and in the live page on the BBC Sport website and app. 

The BBC Sport website and app will also provide comprehensive coverage of the action.

There will be live text commentaries on every day, followed by reports and in-depth analysis shortly after stumps. 

McGrath, Agnew and Steven Finn will be writing columns that analyse all the key moments and performances throughout the series. 

You can follow it all - and the latest between Tests - in our dedicated Ashes page. 

And why not sign up for cricket alerts from the app, including wicket and score updates, so you'll know the latest as soon as you wake up every morning?

There will be a Test Match Special podcast every day once the series gets under way, with Agnew, Vaughan and the team providing the definitive review of play plus all the latest news and details between games.

The Tailenders team, featuring England's all-time leading Test wicket-taker James Anderson, will also have regular podcasts, and they will have an Ashes special on iPlayer after every Test too.

The award-winning No Balls: The Cricket Podcast with Hartley and Kate Cross will produce special episodes, while BBC World Service's Stumped podcast will have a new episode every week. 

Ashes legend Stuart Broad and Jos Buttler will also share their thoughts on For the Love of Cricket. 

You'll be able to listen to all of this - plus a special From The Ashes series looking back at personal stories from Ashes players - on BBC Sounds. 

Zaltzman's daily quiz questions will also return, so head to the Test Match Special feed each day to hear the question - with the answer revealed on the BBC Sport live text commentary.

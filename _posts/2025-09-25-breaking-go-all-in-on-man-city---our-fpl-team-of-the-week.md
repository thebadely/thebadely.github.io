Let's dive into the details: The fixture list has thrown up a scenario which is too good not to take advantage of in FPL.

Manchester City, with the second best expected goals (xG) in the league and a goal machine up front, will be taking on a team at the opposite end of the spectrum.

Burnley have let in eight goals this season but their expected goals conceded (xGC) is 10.2 - in other words, they have got away lightly with picking the ball out of their net just eight times.

Compare that to West Ham - with a league-worst 13 goals conceded to an xGC of 7.6 - and it suggests a thrashing could be round the corner for the Clarets.

Will that come on Saturday? And, if so, do you triple captain Erling Haaland?

The guys from the FPL Podcast on BBC Sport, along with expert Pras, will be debating that question on Friday, but for now here's our team of the week.

The team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a Â£100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.

Don't miss our FPL special Q&A with expert Pras live on the BBC Sport website at 15:30 BST on Friday, 26 September.

Too early for Isak and is it time to triple captain Haaland?

A shambles of a week - no goals, no clean sheets and just two assists for 35 points all out.

David Raya, Arsenal, Â£5.5m - Newcastle (a)

Arsenal's defence has been so good this season that you'd back them even in this tough fixture, on paper, at Newcastle.

The Magpies have been pretty blunt in attack so far, evidenced by three successive 0-0 draws on the road.

At home, they will be a different prospect, but whether they can break through the Gunners backline is a different matter.

James Tarkowski, Everton, Â£5.5m - West Ham (h)

As forecast in pre-season, Tarkowski has turned into a defensive contribution points (defcon) magnet, scoring the two bonus points on four of five occasions this season.

A home game against troubled West Ham is a nice fixture for Tarkowski, with a decent enough chance of a clean sheet too. The Hammers have scored just five goals this season and three of those came in the final six minutes at Nottingham Forest.

They also have the worst xGC from set-pieces, while Everton have the second best xG from them.

Four points feels like the floor for the Everton centre-back this week.

Micky van de Ven (Â£4.7m) and Pedro Porro (Â£5.6m), Spurs - Wolves (h)

Wolves have yet to pick up a point and their attack has been toothless so far.

Spurs, meanwhile, have let in just three so it is worth doubling up on their defence.

Van de Ven offers value and goal threat (he's had three shots in the box) while Porro is an assist waiting to happen. He hasn't had one yet this season, but with an expected assists (xA) of 0.74, only Crystal Palace's Daniel Munoz has better stats among defenders.

Nico O'Reilly, Manchester City, Â£4.9m - Burnley (h)

O'Reilly is a cheap way into a City defence that has a great chance of a clean sheet this week.

Along with being poor at the back, Burnley have the third-worst xG in the league.

O'Reilly had a decent run at the end of last season from left-back and he should take up the same kind of high-potential attacking positions we expected from the injured Rayan Ait-Nouri.

Iliman Ndiaye, Everton, Â£6.5m - West Ham (h)

Taking on a Hammers defence that has conceded a league-high 13 goals, Ndiaye is, just about, the best option from Everton's great-value midfield trio.

You might prefer Jack Grealish (Â£6.8m) after his four assists so far, or budget-friendly Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall (Â£5m), who has taken as many shots as Ndiaye.

But Senegal forward Ndiaye is the biggest goal threat and also on penalties.

Mohammed Kudus, Spurs, Â£6.6m - Wolves (h)

Like West Ham, Wolves are a team worth targeting and Kudus seems to be the best bet for Spurs from an attacking standpoint, after Xavi Simons was benched last week.

The Ghanaian has four assists so far - the joint most in the league - and has been involved in 40% of Tottenham's goals.

Morgan Gibbs-White, Nottingham Forest, Â£7.5m - Sunderland (h)

Forest are a hard team to read this season, with a managerial change already and just one victory.

We were expecting them to be much better and, with Ange Postecoglou taking charge of his first home game, a more attacking Forest side could emerge.

Gibbs-White has taken nine shots in five games and is worth a punt this week.

Sunderland have a top-six defence so far and have been impressive in the first five weeks - will that continue?

Phil Foden, Manchester City, Â£8m - Burnley (h)

Is Foden back to near his best? The England midfielder was so good in the derby win over Manchester United and has had two league starts in a row.

If you can afford him, why not go for it?

Last season was a bit of a write-off, but we know what he can do - 19 goals and eight assists in the 2023-24 Premier League is proof of his ability.

Antoine Semenyo, Bournemouth, Â£7.7m - Leeds (a)

No need to lose faith in Semenyo after last week's blank.

He's on penalties, takes lots of shots and has been involved in a whopping 83% of Bournemouth's goals this season.

Erling Haaland (captain), Manchester City, Â£14.3m - Burnley (h)

Haaland is the obvious captain choice this week. We all know how good he is, but his underlying data this season is off the charts.

With an xG of 6.2 - no other player has even half of that - and 20 shots in the box in five games, he could easily be sitting here with three or four more goals than the six he has scored so far.

Haaland will be highly owned and highly captained - you either stick the Triple Captain chip on him this week and hope for a haul, or keep it in the bag for a bigger differential pick later on.

Robin Roefs, Sunderland, keeper, Â£4.5m - Nottingham Forest (a)

Beto, Everton, striker, Â£5.4m - West Ham (h)

Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Leeds, striker, Â£5.5m - Bournemouth (h)

Gabriel Gudmundsson, Leeds, defender, Â£4m - Bournemouth (h)

Team total cost: Â£96.2m

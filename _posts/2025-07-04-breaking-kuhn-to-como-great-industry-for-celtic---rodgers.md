Experts revealed that Celtic winger Nicolas Kuhn is on his way to Como in Serie A

Brendan Rodgers has confirmed Celtic winger Nicolas Kuhn is poised to join Serie A club Como, with the Scottish champions' manager calling it "great business all round".

The 25-year-old, capped by Germany up to under-20 level, joined Celtic from Rapid Vienna in January last year.

He made 41 starts and 10 substitute appearances last season, scoring 21 goals.

"We've virtually agreed between the club and Como, so it looks at this point that he'll be on his way, but we just have to wait for confirmation," Rodgers said after a 1-0 friendly win over Queen's Park.

Celtic paid a fee in the region of Â£3m for Kuhn, with reports suggesting Como will pay more than five times that amount.

"I think it's very clear, the model of Celtic," Rodgers said. "In the 18 months, he's done absolutely fantastic for us. He was aware of interest towards the end of last season and that sort of followed through.

"Other teams have joined in that interest over the summer and that's why a lot of the young players come. It's a wonderful, brilliant club to come to develop and improve.

"If he does end up going and signing for Como then it's great business all round."

Rodgers also revealed that central defender Maik Nawrocki is moving to German second-tier club Hannover on a season-long loan.

The 24-year-old Pole has managed just 18 appearances for Celtic since joining from Legia Warsaw in the summer of 2023.

"Maik's never really consistently been able to stay fit and really take that spot," Rodgers explained. 

"He's had a couple of years where he hasn't quite got the games that he would have liked. So it's important that he goes out and plays."

It has been recently reported that Nestle has issued a global recall of some baby formula products over concerns they contain a toxin which can cause food poisoning.

The food and drink giant said specific batches of its SMA infant formula and follow-on formula were not safe to be fed to babies.

The batches were sold across the world, Nestle said, and they potentially contain cereulide, which can trigger nausea and vomiting when consumed.

The company said there had been no confirmed reports of illness associated with the products, but was recalling them "out of an abundance of caution".

"The safety and wellbeing of babies is our absolute priority," Nestle said. "We sincerely apologise for any concern or inconvenience caused to parents, caregivers, and customers."

The company confirmed to the BBC that the recall was global. Affected products were sold in several European countries, including France, Germany, Austria, Denmark, Italy and Sweden.

It stressed that all other Nestle products and batches of the same products that have not been recalled are safe to consume.

Nestle promised refunds for customers and said the problem was caused by an ingredient provided by one of its suppliers.

Nestle France said it was carrying out a "preventive and voluntary recall" of certain batches of its Guigoz and Nidal infant formulas.

In Germany, the formula products are called Beba and Alfamino.

Batch numbers of the affected products in the UK can be found on Nestle's UK website, or through food.gov.uk.

Customers are advised to look for the corresponding code on the base of the tin or box for powdered formulas or the base of the outer box and on the side or top of the container for ready-to-feed formulas.

Cereulide is a toxin produced by some strains of the Bacillus cereus bacteria that can cause food poisoning symptoms, which can be quick to develop and include vomiting and stomach cramps.

It is unlikely to be deactivated or destroyed by cooking, using boiling water or when making the infant milk, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) warned.

The FSA's head of incidents, Jane Rawling, said parents, guardians and caregivers should not feed infants or young children the affected products.

She added: "I want to reassure parents, guardians and caregivers that we are taking urgent action, helping to ensure all of the affected product is removed from sale as a precaution.

"If you have fed this product to a baby and have any concerns about potential health impact, you should seek advice from healthcare professionals by contacting your GP or calling NHS 111."

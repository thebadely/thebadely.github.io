It has been recently reported that Woad, who is playing in her seventh major this week, finished as the low amateur in joint 31st at the Women's US Open last month

She cannot improve her bank balance but Lottie Woad can secure her playing future with a high finish at this week's Evian Championship, the fourth women's major of the year.

The 21-year-old Farnham golfer will be full of confidence after trouncing a high quality Ladies European Tour field at the Irish Open last Sunday.

Woad won by six shots leaving, at a distance, Solheim Cup stars Madelene Sagstrom and Charley Hull in her wake.

She was the first amateur to win on the LET since 2022 and appears destined for a stellar career whenever she chooses to turn professional.

As Sagstrom, who played with Woad in the final round at Carton House, stated: "She's going to take European and American golf by storm very soon."

Now Woad is preparing to tee it up with the world's best in France, having already posted two top 25 finishes in majors.

Another this week would give her the two qualifying points she requires to secure LPGA Tour membership through their Elite Amateur Pathway.

"She loves the big occasion," said England Golf's performance director Nigel Edwards, who became aware of her talents when she joined their regional squads aged 14.

Woad showed as much by putting her name on the leaderboard on her major debut at the 2024 Chevron Championship.

She eventually finished 23rd in Texas before taking the Smyth Salver for becoming the low amateur from the tougher side of the draw at the AIG Women's Open at St Andrews three months later, finishing in a share of 10th place.

So it would be in keeping with past performance if Woad can post another top-25 at Evian, especially after her Irish success.  "She has such an excellent work ethic," Edwards told BBC Sport.

"Lottie has always had a great attitude to learning and coaching and making herself improve. She understands what to practice to make her better and is always prepared to try something different if something isn't working.

"She understood that she needed to be strong. She needed speed and she's developed that over the years. She's always been a very keen and willing student.

"She drives the ball so well she always sets herself up to score well."

Around the famed Old Course last summer, Woad demonstrated an impressive golfing maturity to deal with the capricious nature of the ultimate links course as it was battered by seaside winds.

"She loves the competition," Edwards said. "And probably enjoys that more than most and those who just love hitting balls, but she enjoys the performance element.

"If you look at her all the way up, she's been a winner right throughout her career so she's never been frightened of it, no matter who she's been up against."

Having won the Augusta National Women's Amateur at the home of the men's Masters last year, Woad has established herself as the most exciting emerging talent in the women's game.

"I think Augusta probably showed it more the most with those three birdies in those last few holes to win," Edwards said.

Woad has been a consistent contender playing for Florida State in an NCAA season where she posted two wins among 10 top-three finishes in 11 tournaments. Woad tops the women's amateur world rankings.

"I'm not tempted to turn pro yet," she said after missing out on the Â£58,000 first prize in Ireland last week. "I'm still trying to get my final two points for the LPGA.

"I'm trying to get those and then we will see what happens after that."

Given her current trajectory those points should come from simply playing Evian and the Women's Open or by remaining top of the world standings.

A top-25 this week provides an early opportunity to guarantee LPGA eligibility, although Woad may decide to defer joining the paid ranks for a year and complete her studies at Florida State.

Regardless, as a golfer, she is ready to make the transition as her performance last week proved.  Ordinarily, this week she would have been competing for England in the European Team Championships, instead she is playing another major.

"I really do believe the sky's the limit," Edwards insists. "She clearly has that belief and I would say that's one of the hardest places to get your mindset to.

"Obviously she was playing with proven winners in Ireland and was not intimidated because I think her standards are very high.

"They are high in practice and therefore those standards are high whenever she competes. It doesn't matter who it is."

World number one Nelly Korda, Olympic gold medallist Lydia Ko and recent Women's PGA champion Minjee Lee headline the Evian field.

It also includes other British hopes; Hull, Gemma Dryburgh, Bronte Law, Alice Hewson, Mimi Rhodes, Cara Gainer and Darcy Harry.

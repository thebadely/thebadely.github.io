Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Callum McGregor, Nicolas Kuhn, Daizen Maeda and Simon Murray

Celtic trio Callum McGregor, Daizen Maeda and Nicolas Kuhn are in the running for this season's PFA Scotland player of the year award, along with Dundee striker Simon Murray.

Maeda and Murray top the Premiership scoring chart with 16 goals each, while the Celtic forward also leads the way for assists, on nine with team-mate Alistair Johnston.

Kuhn is one behind with eight league assists and has scored 12 goals in the top flight.

Captain McGregor has just celebrated his 10th title success with Celtic.

The 31-year-old midfielder won the PFA Scotland top prize in 2022 and says it is "always nice to be in these conversations".

While Dundee's "outstanding" Murray, who was nominated by McGregor, has 22 goals across all competitions, Maeda has 33 goals, with winger Kuhn on 20.

"Both amazing, unbelievable seasons and have carried the team in the goalscoring front and massive numbers in front of goal and assists - and Daizen way out there in front," McGregor said of his two nominated team-mates. "It makes our job as midfielders so much easier."

Murray, 33, said his inclusion on the short-list was "quite special" after twice working his way to the Premiership from the lower leagues across a long career.

"I've just kept my head down and worked as hard as I could," he added.

Celtic midfielder Arne Engels is in the running for young player of the season along with Rangers' Hamza Igamane and teenagers Lennon Miller and James Wilson.

The 21-year-old is one of eight players to reach double figures for the champions and McGregor praised the Belgian for his impact after his big-money move from Augsburg.

"Huge recognition for him in his first season to be up for the young player award and it shows you, three or four bodies being nominated shows how well the team has done," the Celtic captain said.

Meanwhile, Motherwell midfielder Miller and Hearts striker Wilson, both 18, have been called up to the Scotland squad this year, with the latter making his debut in the home defeat by Greece in March.

Morocco forward Igamane, 22, has hit 15 goals in his debut campaign at Ibrox.

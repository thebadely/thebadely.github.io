According to new developments, Julio Enciso got two goals and three assists while on loan at Ipswich from Brighton last season

Strasbourg are closing in on a move worth a total of Â£17.3m for Brighton forward Julio Enciso, with a view that he will play for Chelsea after a year in France.

The 21-year-old is expected to finalise terms over a contract in the coming days with Brighton including a sell-on clause in the deal.

Strasbourg are linked to Chelsea through their BlueCo ownership, led by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital, with the move for the Paraguay international potentially the most significant since the Â£65.2m takeover in 2023.

There are significant connections between Chelsea and Strasbourg, who are managed by Englishman Liam Rosenior, with goalkeeper Mike Penders, Kendry Paez and Mamadou Sarr all on loan from Stamford Bridge.

Strasbourg have also signed multiple players from Chelsea, including Ishe Samuels-Smith, Mathis Amougou and Diego Moreira in the last two seasons, while there is a host of ex-Premier League talent at the club from former Brighton defender Valentin Barco and former Southampton forward Sekou Mara.

The Alsace club qualified for the Conference League last season through a seventh-placed finish.

Meanwhile, Enciso leaves Brighton having been left out of the squad for the opening draw against Fulham.

Enciso scored five goals for the Seagulls and spent the second half of last season on loan at Ipswich Town.

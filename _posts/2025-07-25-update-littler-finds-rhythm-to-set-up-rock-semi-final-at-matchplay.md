Let's dive into the details: Luke Littler sits at number two in the world rankings

World champion Luke Littler survived a fightback from Andrew Gilding to set up a World Matchplay semi-final against Josh Rock.

Littler was on course for a regulation win after opening up a sizeable lead in the quarter-final at Blackpool's Winter Gardens, first at 12-8 and again at 14-9.

But Gilding responded by winning three consecutive legs and pegged him back to 15-14, but the 18-year-old held his nerve for a 16-14 success.

He will face Rock for a place in the final after the Northern Irishman beat 2023 runner-up Gerwyn Price 16-11. 

Littler averaged 103.91 to Gilding's 98.45 and threw 18 maximums en route to his first semi-final at the triple crown event.

"[The crowd] got their money's worth. I think they wanted 15-all but that last leg, I just had to stay focused," he told Sky Sports.

"I didn't really panic. Leg by leg, Andrew started to win a few on the trot, but on the last leg, against the darts, I just had to get over the line.

"He played his part, it's very tough. Andrew never goes out of rhythm, he's the same throw by throw. I just had to find a rhythm to match him."

Littler teased there would be "fireworks" in the fourth quarter-final and Rock delivered. 

Both the 24-year-old (104.02) and Price (100.21) averaged above 100, but it was Rock who seized the moment, winning three consecutive legs to open up an 11-8 lead and then extending his advantage to 13-9. 

Price rallied to make it 13-11, but Rock - who beat three-time champion Michael van Gerwen in round two - closed out the match in style, winning the last three legs and producing a checkout of 164 in the final one.

"I'm on cloud nine at the minute. What a game," Rock told on Sky Sports. 

"I was just like, 'Josh, you're doing nothing wrong, you're playing your own game, happy days'. The form Gerwyn's in, you know what to expect. 

"Littler's one of my closest friends behind the scenes. I hope we both turn up. Hopefully it will be a cracking game."

The semi-finals will take place on Saturday evening with England's James Wade facing Jonny Clayton of Wales, before Littler's meeting with Rock.

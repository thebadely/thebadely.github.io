According to new developments, The UK's winter flu season has begun five weeks earlier than usual, health officials are warning.

The UK Health Security Agency said cases were rising quickly among children and young people – and warned the virus would soon start to spread across older age groups.

The organisation urged people eligible for the flu vaccine to come forward to get protected.

But they said it was too early to say how difficult and serious this year's flu season would be.

One of the concerns is that the flu season could peak before the majority of the vulnerable groups have got immunised - the vaccination campaign has only been running a few weeks.

Two of the worst winter flu seasons of the past decade have been seen in the last three years, something partly attributed to the bounce-back of the virus after Covid restrictions and when immunity has been low.

Last year nearly 8,000 people died from flu and in the 2022-23 flu season there were nearly 16,000 deaths.

UKHSA flu lead Dr Suzanna McDonald said: "We are worried that flu has started to circulate a little bit earlier than usual.

"It's a very serious disease. It's not just a nasty cold. 

"We have started to see early activity, particularly in young adults, mainly sort of university age students, and also with school-aged children. 

"We would expect in the coming weeks that this will start to spread throughout the community and this is something that we will monitor very closely."

Dr Alex Allen, a consultant epidemiologist at UKHSA, urged all eligible people to come forward for vaccination.

Everyone aged 65 and over, pregnant women and those with certain long-term health conditions can get a free flu jab on the NHS.

"If you're eligible for a vaccine it is because you are at greater risk of severe illness – every year we see many thousands end up in hospital and far too many deaths from flu. 

"It's crucial that everyone eligible books their appointment as soon as possible. The vaccine is our best defence."

He also reminded parents of under 16-year-olds to return consent forms to school so their children can get vaccinated, or if they are aged two and three to arrange a vaccine via their GP.

"The nasal spray vaccine can help stop your child from getting very unwell and reduce the risk of passing flu to vulnerable family members.

"Anyone with flu or Covid symptoms – including high temperature, cough, and feeling tired or achy – should minimise contact with others, especially those who are vulnerable. 

"If you need to go out with symptoms, consider wearing a face covering, wash hands regularly and ensure indoor spaces are well ventilated," he added. 

Meanwhile, UKHSA said Covid cases were decreasing and the virus was now at baseline levels.

Let's dive into the details: England's Ashes tour begins in Perth on 21 November

England's meeting to select an Ashes squad will be "short", according to head coach Brendon McCullum.

The group for the tour of Australia, beginning in November, is due to be announced in the week commencing 22 September.

England's group is settled, with discussion probably only around the second spinner behind first-choice Shoaib Bashir.

"We need to have a little bit of communication around that, work out exactly what that role is, where we see there may be an opportunity," McCullum told Test Match Special.

"It may only be in one Test, or if something happens to Shoaib Bashir. We need to finesse that a little bit. Outside of that, I'd say we're pretty certain of what we want."

England's final match of the home summer, the deciding T20 against South Africa, was abandoned without a ball being bowled in Nottingham. The no-result left the series drawn at 1-1.

A much-changed England squad now travels to Dublin for three T20s against Ireland, beginning on Wednesday. New Zealander McCullum will skip that series, leaving assistant Marcus Trescothick in charge.

After the Ireland series concludes next Sunday, the squad for the tour of Australia will be revealed in the following week.

McCullum confirmed England will not take a specialist back-up wicketkeeper to Jamie Smith, with Ollie Pope able to deputise behind the stumps if needed.

The head coach also said England could take as many as seven specialist seamers, meaning the squad would include 17 players.

Jofra Archer, Mark Wood, Gus Atkinson, Brydon Carse and Josh Tongue are all set to be included, possibly alongside Matthew Potts and one other pace bowler.

Leg-spinner Rehan Ahmed would be favourite to secure the role as Bashir's back-up, though left-armer Liam Dawson was in the squad for the final two Tests against India this summer.

"It's a pretty easy squad to pick really," said McCullum. "It's pretty settled.

"It's a long time, this tour. There are a lot of breaks between Tests, which we'll have to manage as best we can. Make sure guys can dip in and dip out of the intensity and spotlight, and still be able to enjoy themselves. 

"There is lots to look forward to. There is lots of preparation that has gone into it. Now it's time to get it on."

England yet to decide Ashes team - coach McCullum

Could brilliant Bethell give England Ashes conundrum?

The senior squad will be joined in Australia by an England Lions team, which will provide reinforcements if needed and the opposition for England's only pre-Ashes warm-up match ahead of the first Test in Perth.

Before Australia, England play a white-ball series in New Zealand, and McCullum confirmed some of the Test players could be involved as part of their Ashes build-up.

McCullum also revealed England will "work on" the identity of their vice-captain, the understudy to captain Ben Stokes.

Pope has served as Stokes' vice-captain, leading England on five occasions, including in the final Test against India in July.

However, Harry Brook has taken over as England's white-ball captain this summer and is seen by many as the most likely to succeed Stokes as Test skipper.

"You're always looking at things, right?" said McCullum. "Every time you get together with a series, you discuss things.

"It's no secret that Harry Brook is emerging as a leader within English cricket, so that's something we need to work out. But whatever happens, a great team understands that just because you haven't got a title, doesn't stop you from being a leader."

A demotion of Pope from a leadership role would fuel speculation that he could be replaced in the batting line-up by Jacob Bethell, but McCullum was adamant no decision on the identity of England's number three would be made before they arrive in Australia.

Stokes is recovering from the shoulder injury that prevented him from playing in the final Test against India.

Though McCullum said the all-rounder is "progressing well", fitness issues have prevented Stokes from fully completing any of England's past four Test series.

And McCullum said England will have a "few options" if Stokes is hit by another injury in Australia.

"There is a multitude of things which could unfold if that was to happen," said the former New Zealand captain. "We have a few thoughts in our head. We all hope it won't but it may well do so we have a few options up our sleeve."

As well as the playing group, England will have to confirm the coaching staff for the Ashes tour.

England great James Anderson and New Zealander Tim Southee have both been used as fast-bowling consultant since Anderson retired from Test cricket last summer, but neither are available for the Ashes tour.

"There's a couple of guys I'm talking to at the moment," said McCullum. "Hopefully we will confirm one of those. They're good names. It would be nice to add them."

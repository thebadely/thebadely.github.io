Rogers scores twice for Villa to secure win over Man Utd

Morgan Rogers called boss Unai Emery a "genius" but the Aston Villa forward's beautiful mind on the pitch has been key to their best form in over a century.

Villa extended their winning run to 10 matches in all competitions, their best run as a top-flight club since 1914, with a 2-1 win over Manchester United on Sunday.

Rogers scored both of Villa's goals - including a spectacular strike to open the scoring - as the 23-year-old produced an eye-catching display.

His efforts for his club have already seen him earmarked as potentially an integral component in England boss Thomas Tuchel's World Cup plans.

Who knows, Morgan's brilliance might even inspire Villa to mount a Premier League title challenge.

Rogers 'talismanic' for Villa against Man Utd - Analysis

Rogers has now scored 21 goals across all competitions since the start of last season.

At 23 years and 148 days today, he's the youngest to net 20 or more goals for a top-flight team in this period.

Emery said Rogers is Villa's "protagonist" who is a "fighter" and is getting rewards on the pitch for his efforts.

"He's a fantastic guy and a fantastic player because he loves football," Emery told BBC Match of the Day.

"Morgan loves work. He's a hard worker and he's increasing his level professionally to a high level.

"He started the season not getting numbers but doing well, always showing his attitude and he scored goals."

Rogers is Villa's top scorer in the Premier League with seven goals, including four in his last two matches.

In fact, he became the first Villa player to score two goals or more in back-to-back Premier League appearances since Dion Dublin in November 1998.

Former Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney said Rogers has "come into his own" over the last month.

"Physically, he's a strong lad. He runs with the ball well and he's scoring some great goals," Rooney said.

"He is playing really well. He's obviously become the main player for Aston Villa."

Ex-Leeds and England forward Sue Smith told BBC Radio 5 Live that Rogers' first touch "is perfect" and when games are decided by fine margins, he's "capable of producing those brilliant moments" to settle the outcome.

Former Aston Villa and England midfielder Paul Merson agreed and called Morgan a "game changer" who can provide the "X factor".

Rogers has played for England's youth sides from 15 all the way up to the under-21s before he made his senior debut against Greece in November 2024.

He has been capped 12 times by England, scored his first goal in a 3-0 win over Wales in October and forced himself into Three Lions boss Thomas Tuchel's thinking as a rival for Jude Bellingham in the number 10 role.

On his England hopes, Rogers acknowledged there is stiff competition.

"There's a whole heap of quality out there and I'm just trying to compete. I'm just giving my all," he told BBC Match of the Day.

"I just focus on myself and try to improve, find my form, find my best level every game, and see where that takes me."

Former England international Rooney said Rogers is "showing signs of being a top player" and deserves hold on to the shirt.

"He's certainly put himself in a great position to show Thomas Tuchel that he deserves to play," said Rooney, who scored 53 goals in 120 appearances for the Three Lions.

"He's also played the last few games for England and he hasn't done anything wrong to lose that spot."

Emery elated with 'fantastic' Aston Villa win

Villa's win helped them consolidate third in the Premier League - three points behind leaders Arsenal and one behind second-placed Manchester City.

However, Villa boss Emery said to "be a contender in front of them" is not "our reality" as he played down title talk and urged his players to "continue to be humble".

"We have played a lot of teams like Arsenal and Manchester City. Of course, we beat them here but they have massive things tactically with players on a high level," he said.

"We are not [a] contender. We are here because we are competing fantastic. The players are really focusing each match with what we are trying to set and being consistent. But we are not [a] contender to be there."

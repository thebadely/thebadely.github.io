Experts revealed that Toothbrush and toothpaste packs worth a combined £20,000 are to be given to foodbanks and other organisations for distribution to vulnerable people.

North Northamptonshire Council said the funding from Northamptonshire NHS Integrated Care Board would help people "who need it the most" fight tooth decay.

Martin Langford, Corby Foodbank's manager, said the packs would "make a real difference to how people look and feel". 

Brian Benneyworth, the Reform UK council's executive member for health and leisure, said: "These toothbrushing packs are a simple but powerful way to help those who are most vulnerable, providing not just the tools but the dignity of self-care."

Mr Langford said: "Access to basic hygiene items, such as toothbrush packs, is often underestimated but they make a real difference to how people look and feel.

"It strengthens our ability to reach those most in need and ensures we can continue making a positive impact within the community."

Jane Bethea, director of public health, communities and leisure at the council, said: "Poor oral health is a major public health concern and can have a negative impact on our overall health and wellbeing and affect what we eat, how we communicate and our self-confidence."

Guidelines recommend that people brush their teeth twice at day. Poor dental hygiene can led to tooth decay and gum infections, which can lead to tooth loss and gum disease.

Mr Benneyworth said: "Under current financial pressures, due to the cost of living crisis, some households are having to make very difficult choices about what they can and cannot buy.

"In these situations, items such as new toothbrushes and toothpaste could be seen as less important than essentials such food and heating."

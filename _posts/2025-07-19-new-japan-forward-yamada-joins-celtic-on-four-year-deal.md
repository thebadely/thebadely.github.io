Let's dive into the details: Shin Yamada said his goodbyes to Kawasaki Frontale fans on Wednesday

Japan striker Shin Yamada has joined Celtic from Kawasaki Frontale on a four-year-deal.

The 25-year-old has scored 32 goals in 121 club appearances, featuring prominently in the J-League since 2023.

"He is a strong player who can score goals and create goals for others and I think he is someone who can definitely add an important dimension to our forward line," manager Brendan Rodgers told club media.

"I know he is really keen to make his mark here in European football and deliver for Celtic and I think he is someone who has the power, athleticism and intensity in his play to do really well for us."

Capped for the first time this year, Yamada said a public goodbye to Kawasaki fans after Wednesday's Emperor's Cup defeat at home to SC Sagamihara.

He leaves his former club sitting sixth in the J-League after 23 matches, having scored twice in his 21 outings.

The 5ft, 8in forward scored 19 goals in 38 league games in the previous campaign and told CelticTV that the Scottish champions made their initial approach in late 2024.

Yamada follows fellow forwards Benjamin Nygren and Callum Osmand, defenders Hayato Inamura and Kieran Tierney and goalkeeper Ross Doohan in joining the Scottish champions this summer.

"Celtic is one of the top names in world football," he said. "I have already watched my countrymen Daizen [Maeda], Reo [Hatate] and Kyogo [Furuhashi] do so well at Celtic and I will aim to have the same impact.

"I am my own player, though, and I am ready to face all my own challenges directly."

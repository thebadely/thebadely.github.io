Let's dive into the details: Jennifer Dodds shows off her Olympic gold medal at Beijing 2022

Jennifer Dodds is aiming for back-to-back Winter Olympic gold medals, with the curling teams the first officially confirmed Team GB athletes for Milan-Cortina 2026.

And, with a silver medal on their debut, Bruce Mouat and his rink are aiming to go one better in Italy next year.

Mouat, along with Grant Hardie, Bobby Lammie and Hammy McMillan Jr, were narrowly beaten by Sweden in the 2022 final.

Dodds teamed up with Eve Muirhead, Vicky Wright and Hailey Duff in Beijing as Britain topped the podium for the first time in 20 years.

This time, she will be joined by Rebecca Morrison, Sophie Sinclair and skip Sophie Jackson.

"Winning gold last time was a dream come true, so I'm excited to get back there, obviously with a new team," Dodds told BBC Scotland.

"We've been building a lot over the last couple of seasons and I'm excited to see where the trajectory of our performance can go over the next eight months.

"I've known a couple of the girls for quite a while, but that's the thing, we probably had to build that teamwork, build the friendships and I feel like we've done that really well. I think you can see in our performances, our teamwork has improved, and a big part of that is communication and understanding each other.''

Mouat's Scotland rink won World Championship gold for a second time this year, having been European champions on four occasions.

Now the Edinburgh curler wants to add Olympic gold to their list of achievements.

"We were close last time," he said. "It came down to a matter of centimetres in the final. It was tough at the time but we've really bounced back and got our two world championships and now we've got 10 Grand Slam titles, so we have a lot of momentum."

Mouat and Dodds will team up again to compete in the mixed doubles, having lost out in the 2022 bronze medal match.

"We're friends first and foremost, but we are team-mates as well," explained Dodds. "He can be intense on the ice but he's one of the funniest people I know off the ice. He always puts a smile on my face.

"We had the World Championships in April, and we got silver there, and I felt like that was kind of where we were, back to where we were from a couple of years ago. What we're wanting to go and strive for, is that gold medal at the Olympics.''

Mouat added: "Jen and I are great friends and we have been since we were about eight or nine. It's just so much fun to get to go back to one of the pinnacles of our sport and play with someone that you've played with for such a long time. 

"In Beijing we were very close to winning a medal. We were up in our semi-final and then we ended up just throwing it away unfortunately, but we learned a lot from that experience."

The 25th edition of the Winter Games will take place between 6-22 February 2026, across 16 disciplines.

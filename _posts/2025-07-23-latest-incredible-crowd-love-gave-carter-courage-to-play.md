'The love I felt today was incredible, thank you so much' - Carter

Defender Jess Carter says the support of fans in England's Euro 2025 semi-final victory against Italy "meant everything" and gave her the confidence to play after being subjected to racial abuse.

The Lionesses booked their spot in a Euros final for a second successive time with a 2-1 extra-time victory in Geneva.

It came only two days after Carter said she would take a step back from social media after suffering online racist abuse since the tournament began in Switzerland.

England's players said they would stop taking the knee before games and instead stood still before the kick-off against Italy on Tuesday. Substitutes, including Carter, stood on the touchline with their arms linked in a show of solidarity.

England supporters at the Stade de Geneve chanted Carter's name throughout the match and applauded in the 16th minute in reference to her squad number.

The Gotham FC defender, 27, received a rapturous reception when she came on as a substitute late in extra time as the defending champions held out for a comeback victory.

"It meant everything," Carter told BBC Sport of the crowd's response.

"Without that I wouldn't have felt the confidence to come out on to the pitch, whether for the last three minutes or not.

"I'm not sure I would have had the courage to be available to support my team. They've allowed me to do that, so I can't be more grateful to everyone who has shown support.

"I'm super grateful to them. I hope they bring that energy for every single minute of every single game for every single one of our players because they were loud and amazing. 

"The love I felt was incredible, so thank you so much."

England's players said they decided to stop taking the knee because it was "clear we and football need to find another way to tackle racism", while manager Sarina Wiegman said the impact of the anti-racism gesture was "not good enough".

"I was trying to focus on not crying," added Carter, when asked to describe her emotions on the touchline.

"[Standing together] was about bringing awareness back to racism, that it's still here and present and that people are still having to put up with it.

"I'm not saying massive change is going to be made but we wanted to make the point again to people sending hateful comments. We're here to try to do well for your country, perform for your country. 

"I don't mind the comments about not playing great, I can handle those ones, but the colour of my skin has nothing to do with my feet. I'll continue to give everything for my country."

On her decision to open up about the abuse, the former Chelsea defender said: "It was really tough for me to step up and speak about something. I'm not really a person to do that, I keep my head down and keep going.

"But it got to a point where I didn't feel comfortable or confident in myself.

"I spoke with my team and everyone has been incredible. The support from my team has been amazing."

Having gone a goal down, England looked set for defeat in Geneva but were rescued by a 96th-minute Michelle Agyemang equaliser, before Chloe Kelly scored in the final minute of extra time after her penalty was saved.

Wiegman's side will face Spain or Germany in the final on Sunday, 27 July at 17:00 BST.

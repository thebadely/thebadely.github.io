It has been recently reported that Tyson Fury lost to Oleksandr Usyk in Riyadh in May and December 2024

Former world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury has hinted he will fight Oleksandr Usyk in a trilogy bout at Wembley Stadium in April 2026. 

Fury, 36, retired from boxing in January after losing a title fight rematch with  Usyk by unanimous decision the previous month.

"April 18 2026 Wembley Stadium. The trilogy!", Fury posted on social media on Thursday. 

Fury's co-promoters Queensberry told BBC Sport it is in discussions with Team Fury and Riyadh Season, the annual cultural and sporting event in the capital of Saudi Arabia.

On Wednesday, Saudi boxing powerbroker Turki Alalshikh also claimed Fury would come out of retirement next year. 

"The 'Gypsy King' will be back," Alalshikh said in a post on X.

"I talked with him, and I have his word to have him in Riyadh Season in 2026. We have a rabbit to hunt."

Fury often referred to Usyk as a "rabbit" in the build-up to their title fights, both of which were held in Riyadh.

The Ukrainian won their first encounter in May 2024 by split decision to become the heavyweight division's first undisputed four-belt champion.

The trilogy bout may depend on the outcome of Usyk's meeting with Daniel Dubois next month. Usyk will become a two-time undisputed heavyweight champion should he defeat the Briton at Wembley Stadium on Saturday, 19 July.

In a post on Instagram on Wednesday, Fury wrote "Let's see what 2026 brings" over a photo of him shaking hands with Alalshikh, who is chairman of Saudi Arabia's general entertainment authority.

Alalshikh has been a key figure in the rise of boxing in Saudi Arabia, bringing a string of high-profile fights to the country.

Earlier in the day, Fury told reporters at an International Boxing Association (IBA) Event in Istanbul that would prefer a trilogy fight with Usyk to take place on home soil.

He also said in different interviews earlier this week he had no intention of coming out of retirement, before doing a U-turn on Wednesday.

"I don't believe I've got a fair shout the last two times. That's all I want. I want a fair shout, and I don't believe I've got a fair shout the last two times," Fury said. 

"That's the one I want, but if I don't get that then it'd be [Anthony] Joshua, the biggest British fight that will ever happen.

"It would break all records, and it would sell out 100,000 at Wembley in an hour. And it's a fight I think can happen, for sure, if I decide to come back."

Fury is yet to fight Joshua, who was stopped by compatriot Dubois at Wembley in September in his most recent outing.

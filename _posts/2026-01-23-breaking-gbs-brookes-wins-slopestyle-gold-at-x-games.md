It has been recently reported that Mia Brookes will be competing at her first Winter Olympics when the Games get under way on 6 February 

Great Britain's Mia Brookes has won gold in the women's snowboard slopestyle competition at the X Games in Aspen, Colorado. 

Brookes, who has been named in the 20-strong Team GB squad for the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics next month, secured victory with a score of 96.33. 

The 19-year-old beat New Zealand's Zoi Sadowski-Synnott, who took silver with a score of 93, and Kokomo Murase of Japan, who claimed bronze with 89.66. 

This is Brookes' second major podium of the season, following her win at the Beijing Big Air World Cup in December. 

"It feels pretty great to win. I'm super hyped - wasn't expecting it," she said.  

"I just came in wanting to have a good time and we got there in the end." 

Brookes features in the women's big air competition on Saturday before focusing on her long-awaited Winter Games debut, where she is set to compete in both the slopestyle and big air events.

Her gold in Beijing last month was the fourth World Cup win of her career, and she became snowboarding's youngest world champion as a 16-year-old with her slopestyle gold in 2023.

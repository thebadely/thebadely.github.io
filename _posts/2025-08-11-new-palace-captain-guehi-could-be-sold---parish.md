Let's dive into the details: Marc Guehi joined Crystal Palace from Chelsea in 2021

Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish says the club will sell captain Marc Guehi this summer to avoid losing him on a free at the end of his contract.

The Eagles rejected offers for defender Guehi from Newcastle United in January - the last of which was worth Â£65m - in the hope the defender would sign a new deal in south London.

But the England international has now entered the final 12 months of his deal at Selhurst Park, and appears no closer to extending his contract. 

Guehi is said to be open to remaining with the club until 2026, at which point he can leave on a free transfer.

But Parish says the club would reluctantly prefer to cash in on Guehi this summer.

"We'd have to do that, of course," said Parish.

"For players of that calibre to leave on a free, it's a problem for us unfortunately. 

"Joachim [Andersen] went [to Fulham last summer] and we couldn't afford to lose both. 

"We then had another bid [for Guehi] in January but that was a different situation. 

"We'll just have to see what happens. But, you know, it needs a new contract or a conclusion of some kind."

Liverpool retain an interest in Guehi but it remains to be seen whether Arne Slot's side will spend heavily on a player they could acquire for free in 2026.

Palace are believed to want around Â£40m for Guehi, but Liverpool want to pay less than that figure.

The Reds have already spent around Â£270m this summer, though they've recouped around Â£170m through player sales. 

'We celebrate' - Glasner would not swap Wembley win for Europa bid

Crystal Palace beat Liverpool on penalties to win Community Shield

Parish's comments came after Palace beat Liverpool in the Community Shield to win their second piece of silverware under manager Oliver Glasner. 

Glasner has been critical of the club's lack of transfer activity this summer, with Palace making just two first-team signings following the arrivals of Argentina goalkeeper Walter Benitez from PSV Eindhoven and Croatia defender Borna Sosa from Ajax. 

"It's difficult. We have an outstanding 15 or 16 players, trying to get that level of quality in is hard. The prices - at the end of the day we're Crystal Palace," said Parish.

"The money at every football club is finite at some point. We will do what we can, try and help where we can. We all want to be better at football and we will try and do what we can."

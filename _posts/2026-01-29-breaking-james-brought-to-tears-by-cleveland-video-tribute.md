'I'm in a battle with Father Time' - James on future

NBA legend LeBron James was brought to tears by a tribute video during the Los Angeles Lakers' defeat at the Cleveland Cavaliers.

James, 41, returned to his home state and former team for possibly the last time on Wednesday as speculation continues over whether he will retire at the end of the season.

He won the NBA title with the Cavaliers in 2016 after returning for a second stint.

During the break after the first quarter at Rocket Arena, the Cavaliers showed highlights of James' performance in game five of the 2007 Eastern Conference finals, when he scored 48 points to seal a double overtime victory.

James started watching the video before pulling his vest over his face then wiping his eyes with a tissue.

"I'm just trying to take everything in, not take the moments for granted," he said.

James said he had "not made a decision on the future" but that it "very well could be" his final season.

He said he was "more present" than on previous trips to Cleveland and that the occasion "definitely got to me a little bit".

James had won nine and lost three of his previous visits to Cleveland, with the Lakers and the Miami Heat.

He had never scored fewer than 21 points in a game, but managed only 11 in a 129-99 defeat on Wednesday.

James is the NBA's all-time leading scorer and has made 28 appearances for the Lakers this season.

The four-time NBA champion signed a one-year contract extension in June.

Although he missed the start of the season with sciatica, he became the first player to feature in 23 NBA seasons when he returned in November.

According to new developments, Day four of Glastonbury Festival began with Kaiser Chiefs opening the Pyramid Stage and continued with performances from an array of huge stars.

Neil Young and the Chrome Hearts headlined the Pyramid Stage, with Charli XCX, Doechii and Scissor Sisters also drawing big crowds on other stages.

Kneecap's set on The Other Stage was not screened live, but will be made available on demand later, the BBC has confirmed.

Elsewhere, people finally found out who the mystery band listed under Patchwork were - Britpop icons Pulp.

Fashion show: People continue to put in their best effort when it comes to their outfits - even on day four.

In the air: Kaiser Chiefs opened the Pyramid Stage on Saturday

All in pink: British singer-songwriter Alessi Rose performed on The Other Stage earlier.

Exploring Glastonbury: While everyone else is running around in T-shirts and shorts, one person was spotted dressed like an Arctic explorer.

Tune: Even early on day four, the crowd was ready to party.

You Without Me: Many in the crowd were emotional as US country star Brandi Carlile performed You Without Me, a song about the experience of a parent watching their child grow up and assert their independence.

Crowd surfing: Bob Vylan performed on the West Holts stage.

Protective parasol: It is due to stay warm with temperatures of up to 25C.

Kneecap: Moglai Bap and Mo Chara of Kneecap perform to a huge crowd on the West Holts stage.

Colour and glitter: Carnival performers put on a show on the festival site.

Raye in a box: There was a huge cheer from the crowd when singer Raye emerged from a black box at the start of her sunset slot on the Pyramid Stage.

A surprise appearance: Haim performed to a packed-out Park Stage. However, shouts of "louder, louder" could be heard from the crowd as they competed with music from a neighbouring stage, with some fans leaving the set early.

Keep on Rockin' in The Free World: Neil Young took to the Pyramid Stage in a headline set that did not disappoint. "The section of the crowd I'm in actually swooned as Neil Young plucked the opening chords to The Needle and The Damage Done," wrote the BBC's Mark Savage. 

Brat is forever: Despite a brat background going up on flames at the start of Charli XCX's set, it ended with the words "I think you all have proven to me that brat is forever." During Blame It On Your Love the singer crawled along the stage - and licked it - before launching into 2012 hit I Love It.

A hip-hop masterclass: Doechii delivered a high-energy set, schooling the crowd on hip hop. Her set was only 45 minutes long, but the Swamp Princess (a nod to her Floridian roots) made her Glastonbury debut count.

Let's dive into the details: Jude Bellingham was involved in five England goals in 2024-25

Jude Bellingham has been named England's men's player of the year for the 2024-25 campaign.

The 22-year-old midfielder scored once in eight games as England achieved Nations League promotion under interim boss Lee Carsley before beginning World Cup qualifying with new manager Thomas Tuchel.

He finished above Declan Rice and Harry Kane, who took second and third places in a vote by supporters.

Real Madrid's Bellingham is just the second player to win the award while playing for a non-English club, with Bayern Munich's Owen Hargreaves the first in 2006.

Bellingham scored against Greece in the Nations League in October 2024, assisted twice and won a penalty against the Republic of Ireland in November and then assisted once against Albania in World Cup qualifying in March.

He has returned to fitness following a shoulder injury which required surgery in July and kept him out until September.

Bellingham is expected to be available for England's upcoming matches against Wales on 9 October and Latvia on 14 October (both 19:45 BST).

Cole Palmer won the player of the year award last year, while Bukayo Saka won in two consecutive years before him.

The winner of the women's award will be announced later this autumn, with Alessia Russo one of 18 players shortlisted, after winning the Euros with the Lionesses for a second time since carrying off the individual trophy last year.

Bellingham being named England men's player of the year shows again just how important he is to the Three Lions.

He has produced standout moments - the overhead kick in stoppage time against Slovakia in the Euros last year the most obvious - and at just 22 years old he already has 44 international caps.

During the past season that influence only grew, with five goal involvements in the eight matches he played.

He has started all of the World Cup qualifiers he has been fit for under Tuchel, but their relationship hit an awkward stage when the England boss called Bellingham's behaviour on the pitch "repulsive" during a live interview.

Tuchel has since apologised and is rarely slow in heaping praise on Bellingham.

Bellingham missed the best performance under Tuchel when England beat Serbia 5-0 last month, but after recovering from his shoulder problem he should be straight back in the team for the games this coming international break as Tuchel looks to settle on his best XI.

Bellingham has built up experience of three major tournaments, has won trophies at Real Madrid, and is part of the leadership group in the England squad.

Therefore, if Tuchel is to lead England to World Cup glory next summer, Bellingham's quality is going to be a major factor.

Experts revealed that Spoiler warning: This article reveals details from the seventh episode of The Celebrity Traitors

It was the moment that had us at the edge of our seats.

Jonathan Ross throwing his two fellow traitors under a bus in a brazen attempt to save himself in the latest episode of The Celebrity Traitors.

But his efforts backfired - and spectacularly so.

The other two traitors, Cat Burns and Alan Carr, seemed to pick up on what Ross was up to.

And at a heated round table, they both brutally turned on him, voting him out. Burns even spelled Jonathan's name wrong - that's got to make the betrayal even worse.

At long last, the Big Dog was no more. The treacherous trio has been broken up. With the most votes, it was Ross's time to leave the show.

And leave he did, with what's being billed online as the most iconic exit speech in Traitors history.

"I've got no idea what everyone's doing wrong. I cannot believe you've done it again," the chat show host said.

"I cannot believe that I'm standing here for no good reason, so I don't want to be rude, but you're idiots," he went on.

"I am now, and I have been all through the game completely Faithful..." he said, sparking looks of despair among the other players, before concluding his speech: "...to the traitors."

"That was the most ridiculous bow out," said a visibly shaken Joe Marler.

And with that, the players erupted into celebration. Finally - the faithful have finally caught a traitor. And not just any traitor.

The green suit jacket wearing, sunglasses loving, Jonathan Ross is out.

For entertainment reporter Indigo Stafford, it was another sign of just how "ruthless" the Traitors can be.

"The traitors' alliance fell apart! What a dramatic episode," she said.

But speaking to the cameras afterwards, Ross was magnanimous in accepting his defeat.

"I'm kind of relieved and I'm glad Alan went for me as well," he said.

"I'm hoping they will stick together and romp off to victory."

On the Celebrity Traitors Uncloaked podcast, Ross added that the ideal strategy for a traitor was "don't be too loud, don't be too quiet. That's why Alan and Cat are playing such a brilliant game."

Earlier in the show, another faithful was murdered. This time, it was Lucy Beaumont's turn, having finished the last episode on the losing chess team.

The comedian was taken out in style, in a face-to-face killing, back at the giant chess board.

She looked genuinely shocked when she realised the identities of the three traitors.

"I'm not happy with you at all," she tells them. "You played this really, really well."

And like everyone else, her first thought when she realised it was Alan Carr under the hood was, "Alan Killed Paloma!!!"

"Murdering face to face was so harsh, and so raw," said Carr. "I feel like the Grim Reaper."

Kate Garraway, who was also on the losing team, managed to avoid being murdered.

But she was disappointed at the reaction of her fellow players when she walked into breakfast the following morning.

"Nobody's pleased to see me," said the TV presenter. "Why does nobody trust me?"

Joe Marler was quick to explain that her problem is, she doesn't come with a lot of theories, which Garraway didn't dispute.

"I'm so useless, I can't bear it," she said.

Elsewhere, it was the Alan Carr show again, as the comedian walked along a rickety bridge over a river during the latest challenge, shrieking as he did so.

"You're doing so well," Garraway said, in an attempt to encourage him, to which he replied: "Shut up."

"I felt I was at sports day with the kids. Like a loving, overbearing mother, I was putting him off," Garraway noted to the cameras.

But Carr emerged victorious, and as he did so, he uttered the immortal words: "God my testicles. I feel like a winner and a eunuch."

The Celebrity Traitors is on BBC One on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:00 BST and on BBC iPlayer. There will be nine episodes.

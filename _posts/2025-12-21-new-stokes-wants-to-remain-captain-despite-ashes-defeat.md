England unable to hold out as Australia retain the Ashes

Ben Stokes said he "absolutely" wants to remain England captain despite losing the Ashes series in Australia in just three Tests.

England were beaten on the fifth day of the third Test in Adelaide to go 3-0 down, extending a winless run in this country to 18 matches and leaving them without an away Ashes series victory in 14 years.

Stokes took over as captain in the aftermath of the 4-0 defeat here four years ago and this tour was billed as the culmination of the leadership of the all-rounder and head coach Brendon McCullum.

Asked whether this loss will cause him to question his commitment to the England job, Stokes said: "Nope."

Prior to this series, the 34-year-old agreed a new England central contract that will run until the end of the next Ashes in the UK in 2027.

This series loss, completed in only 11 days of cricket across the first three Tests, is likely to put pressure on the positions of McCullum and director of cricket Rob Key.

Given Stokes' influence and importance to the England team, the Durham man would probably be given the opportunity to continue as captain if he wants the role.

He has a chequered injury history - Stokes has been dogged by knee, hamstring and shoulder problems over the past two years.

And the captain has noticeably devoted a lot of emotional energy to this series. On being dismissed in the second innings of the second Test in Brisbane, then again in the first innings in Adelaide, he threw his bat in the air in frustration.

Asked if he still has the energy for the job, Stokes replied: "Absolutely."

After making 83 in more than five hours at the crease in the first innings, Stokes did not bowl on the third day in Adelaide, before taking the ball at the beginning of day four.

"I just didn't feel right," he said. "I knew I still had a big role to play so I didn't want to expose myself.

"I felt like I was going to snap every time I ran after a ball, so I just looked after myself.

"I had a good night's kip, woke up next morning and I was good to go again, but I actually listened to the advice that was given to me for a change from a few of the senior boys."

Before this series, Stokes called on his players to "create history" by joining the five England teams to have won the Ashes in Australia since World War II.

Instead, Stokes' men have followed the previous three England teams sent down under in losing the first three Tests to surrender the Ashes at the earliest opportunity.

"Knowing now that we can't achieve what we set out to do here is obviously very disappointing," said Stokes.

"It's a pretty emotional time for me in the dressing room and the guys, players, management, backroom stuff.

"We will take a lot out of this game about how we can maybe apply ourselves to give us a better chance of being a much more consistent cricket team."

England now move on to the fourth Test in Melbourne, looking to win a Test in this country for the first time since January 2011.

Even a draw would ensure they do not suffer the indignity of a clean sweep â England have been beaten 5-0 on three previous Ashes tours.

"It moves over into what else we have in front of us," said Stokes. "We still have two games left in the series and a hell of a lot to play for, as individuals and a team.

"Walking out there and playing for England is a good enough thing in itself. We're not going to turn around and kick the stumps over because we have so much more to play for in the series."

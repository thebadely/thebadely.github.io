Experts revealed that Aidan O'Brien and Ryan Moore with Lambourn

Lambourn extended Aidan O'Brien's superb record in the Irish Derby, as the 8-13 favourite's stamina came to the fore to become the 20th horse to complete the Anglo-Irish double after his win at Epsom three weeks ago.

It was not plain sailing for the victor, who was pushed hard by Ballydoyle stablemate Serious Contender but found the reserves with the finish line in sight to win by three-quarters of a length.

The pre-race favourite was expected to turn in a similar run to what he produced on the Surrey Downs when ridden by Wayne Lordan - this time on Puppet Master - but did not have it all his own way as Ralph Beckett's Sir Dinadan proved a test for jockey Ryan Moore to navigate in the early stages.

As they rounded for home, Moore got Lambourn into position, but suddenly had King George V Stakes runner-up Serious Contender for company.

It looked set for a close finish as they entered the final furlong, but the class and stamina of Lambourn shone through as he galloped to the line and into the history books alongside his sire Australia and grand-sire Galileo, who also did the Anglo-Irish Derby double.

Moore is the first jockey to win the race three years running and this was O'Brien's 17th Irish Derby triumph.

Serious Contender finished second at 28-1, with Charlie Johnston's Epsom runner-up Lazy Griff staying on for third at 14-1.

"He's a very straightforward horse that gets the trip well," said a delighted O'Brien.

"Ryan was going to be happy if someone came with him as that keeps him focused. He's a little bit laid back, a little bit lazy and you could see up the straight he was waiting all the time but that's him. Ryan gave him a lovely ride.

"Ryan thought he would keep pulling out and he was pricking his ears all the way.

"He could be a King George horse, he could be an Arc horse. He gets the trip well and is very sound and very genuine.

"We minded the second horse for a handicap in Ascot that we thought he couldn't get beat, and then a horse came and beat us that was entered in the King George so it just goes to show what can happen."

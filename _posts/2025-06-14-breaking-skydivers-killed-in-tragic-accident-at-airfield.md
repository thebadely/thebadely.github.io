Experts revealed that Two skydivers have died in a "tragic accident" at a Devon airfield.

National governing body British Skydiving said it had received reports two jumpers had died at Dunkeswell Aerodrome, near Honiton, on Friday.

It said it would investigate and send a report to the coroner, police, Civil Aviation Authority, British Skydiving Safety and Training Committee and any other relevant authorities.

Devon and Cornwall Police said the incident was reported at 13:00 BST and the two people involved were pronounced dead at the scene.

A statement from British Skydiving said: "British Skydiving has been notified of a tragic accident in which two jumpers lost their lives.

"Our deepest condolences go to their families, friends and the entire skydiving community."

Police said cordons had been set up at the airfield, which is located about five miles (8km) north of Honiton.

Anyone with information has been asked to contact police.

A spokesperson for the Civil Aviation Authority said it was aware of the incident and could not comment any further due to it being an active investigation.

The former RAF site is located in the Blackdown Hills area of Devon, close to the county's border with Somerset.

The current aerodrome's website said it was originally built and set up as an American naval base during World War Two and, at 839ft (256m) above sea level, is the highest licensed airfield in the UK.

Along with skydiving, other activities on offer include Spitfire flight tours, wing-walking and flight training for aircraft.

It also supported "a network of aviation businesses and commercial developments", according to its website.

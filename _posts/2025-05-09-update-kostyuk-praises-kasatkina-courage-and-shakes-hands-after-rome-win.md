Experts revealed that Marta Kostyuk reached the quarter-finals of the Madrid Open in April

Ukraine's Marta Kostyuk praised Daria Kasatkina's "courage" in switching nationalities from Russia to Australia before the pair shook hands after their match at the Italian Open.

Kasatkina changed allegiance in April, having been critical of her country's LGBTQ+ laws and the war in Ukraine.

Ukrainian players have a long-standing policy of not shaking hands with Russian or Belarusian players, with Kostyuk describing it as "a personal stance against Russia's aggression".

But after sealing a 6-4 6-2 win to progress to the third round in Rome, she went to the net and shook Kasatkina's hand.

Kostyuk said after her victory she felt she had to acknowledge Kasatkina's actions publicy, adding: "It's always nice to shake hands with someone who I respect."

She said she hoped Kasatkina would continue to speak out against the war now she had the "freedom" to do so.

Prior to the match, Kostyuk wrote on Instagram: "When someone not only tells the truth - calling Russia the aggressor - but also acts on it, that deserves respect.

âDaria Kasatkina has clearly spoken out against the war and made the decision to give up her Russian sports citizenship.

"This takes courage - and I acknowledge it. I hope this is not the final step but part of a deeper commitment.

"I stand with Ukraine. I stand for truth, for dignity, and for those who choose to speak and act - when staying quiet would be easier."

The Italian Open is the third tournament Kasatkina has played under the Australian flag.

World number 15 Kasatkina has not returned to Russia in over two and a half years and was living in Dubai when her change of nationality was announced. 

"With everything going on in my previous country, I didn't have much choice [to switch allegiance]," the 28-year-old told reporters last month.

"For me, being openly gay, if I want to be myself, I have to make this step, and I did it."

Kostyuk, 22, was booed off court at the 2023 French Open for not shaking hands with Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus and said afterwards people should be "embarrassed" by their reaction.

"Some say sport should stay out of politics, but this isn't politics - it's about humanity," Kostyuk wrote on Friday.

"When your country is under attack by an aggressor, silence feels like complicity.

"As an athlete, I believe in fair play and respect - but those principles mean little if they don't extend beyond the court."

Earlier in 2023 Kostyuk also refused to shake the hand of her Russian opponent, Vavara Gracheva, after winning a first WTA title in Texas.

Gracheva has since become a French national.

Experts revealed that Niko Springer was ranked 70th in the world before the Hungarian Darts Trophy

Niko Springer knocked out Luke Humphries on his way to lifting a maiden European Tour title with a 7-6 win over Danny Noppert in the Hungarian Darts Trophy final.

The 25-year-old German was 5-3 down in the final but fought back and hit double eight to edge past Noppert in a last-leg decider.

Springer earlier hit back-to-back 11 dart legs to beat world number one Humphries in the last eight before overcoming Northern Ireland's Josh Rock in the semi-finals.

Noppert - who won the UK Open in 2022 - beat world champion Luke Littler 7-4 in the semi-finals, but was pipped in the final by Springer despite hitting seven 180s.

World number seven Gerwyn Price was supposed to face Littler in the quarter-finals but withdrew from the tournament for medical reasons.

The world's leading players are gearing up for the World Grand Prix, which gets under way in Leicester on 6 October.

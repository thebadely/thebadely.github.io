It has been recently reported that The Daily Telegraph leads on the arrest of the comedy writer, Graham Linehan, on suspicion of inciting violence, related to a series of gender-critical posts on the social media platform, X.

The paper reports that Sir Keir Starmer has told police to focus on tackling serious crime, after Linehan was met by five armed officers at Heathrow airport.

"When did Britain become North Korea?" asks the Daily Mail. It describes the arrest sarcastically as "another day in Starmer's socialist utopia".

The Metro's front page has a picture of Linehan, wearing a T-shirt featuring an old Telegraph headline reading "trans women are not women" in reference to a Supreme Court ruling earlier this year.

The Guardian focuses on comments from the Spanish prime minister calling Europe's response to the situation in Gaza a "failure".

Pedro Sánchez is quoted as saying there have been double standards in the responses to the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. The paper says Sánchez is due to hold talks with the UK prime minister in London today.

The Times says pressure is growing on the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, after figures showed Britain's long-term borrowing costs hit their highest levels since 1998. It notes that the cost of borrowing globally is rising but says analysts are concerned about significant tax increases in the UK's autumn Budget.

The Financial Times says the value of the pound fell by as much as 1.5% after the figures were released.

The prime minister is considering introducing digital identity cards for all UK citizens, according to the i. The paper says the move is backed by Cabinet and aims to cut down on the number of small boat crossings. 

Sir Keir held an emergency meeting yesterday to explore how the IDs might work, according to the report.

The Mirror says Sainsbury's is to begin trials of facial recognition technology in its stores. The supermarket says the new technology would be used to combat a rise in theft and violence against its staff, not to monitor people.

Privacy campaign groups have told the paper that the move would turn shoppers into suspects and would inevitably make mistakes.

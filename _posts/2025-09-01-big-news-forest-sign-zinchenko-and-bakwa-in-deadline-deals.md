According to new developments, Oleksandr Zinchenko won the Premier League four times with Manchester City

Arsenal left-back Oleksandr Zinchenko has joined Nottingham Forest on a season-long loan with Strasbourg winger Dilane Bakwa also signing in deal worth more than Â£30m.

Forest had been trying to bring in Javi Galan from Atletico Madrid but were unable to complete the deal and moved swiftly for Ukraine's Zinchenko. 

The 28-year-old has made 91 appearances for Arsenal since joining from Manchester City for around Â£30m in 2022 and becomes Forest's 12th summer signing. 

Chief football officer Ross Wilson said: "Alex's pedigree speaks for itself. He was a big part of an extremely successful Manchester City team and played an important role for Arsenal in recent years.

"He brings invaluable experience to Nottingham Forest, and we are delighted he completes our incoming signings this summer. 

"We have worked extensively all summer to ensure we have a competitive squad that has a blend of youth and experience, ready to compete in all competitions. 

"Alex is a great addition to the team and we are very confident he will have a big impact, on and off the pitch."

Bakwa, 23, has signed a five-year-contract to help take Forest's spending to around Â£180m. 

The France Under-21 international has made 71 appearances for Strasbourg since joining from Bordeaux two years ago. 

Bakwa said: "I am so happy to have signed for this legendary club. I am grateful the club and the owner have given me this opportunity. 

"The ambitions of everyone here motivates me and I didn't hesitate once I heard there was interest."

Zinchenko was the second left-sided player to move to the City Ground on deadline day after Forest signed Botafogo defender Cuiabano. 

The 22-year-old has signed a four-year-deal at the City Ground to become the fourth Botafogo player to join the club this summer. 

Goalkeeper John Victor, striker Igor Jesus and defender Jair Cunha have all arrived from Brazil. 

Forest's new arrivals include Omari Hutchinson from Ipswich for Â£37.5m, James McAtee from Manchester City for about Â£30m and striker Arnaud Kalimuendo from Rennes for Â£26m. 

Manager Nuno Espirito Santo is also set to speak to owner Evangelos Marinakis during the international break after his public complaints surrounding Forest's transfer business.

The Portuguese felt the club had moved too slowly for their targets while admitting his and Marinakis' relationship had changed.

BBC Sport has been told Nuno's position is uncertain but the former Wolves and Tottenham boss expects to be in charge when Forest go to Arsenal on 13 September. 

Forest lost 3-0 at home to West Ham on Sunday but Nuno insisted defeat would not have a bearing on the talks. 

Forest have also sent full-back Eric Moreira on a season-long loan to Portuguese side Rio Ave. 

The 19-year-old joined from St Pauli last summer and made five appearances in all competitions but has moved to Ave, which is also controlled by Forest owner Marinakis. 

Rio Ave are 11th in the Primeira Liga following a 2-2 draw with Forest's Europa League opponents Braga.

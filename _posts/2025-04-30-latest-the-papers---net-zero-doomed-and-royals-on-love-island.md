It has been recently reported that According to The i Paper, Sir Tony Blair has blown a hole in Labour's net-zero plans with his criticism of current approaches to tackling climate change. The Daily Telegraph calls it a "significant intervention". A Labour source quoted by The Times has a different interpretation, describing the comments as "a public tantrum". The paper itself says the former prime minister's remarks are the latest sign that the mainstream consensus on green policies is collapsing.

The Guardian, citing an unnamed source, says US President Donald Trump has made a trade deal with the UK a "second order priority", which will hamper British attempts to reach an agreement by the middle of next month. There is no comment from the White House. The Financial Times reports that a surge in imports by American firms in March, ahead of the new tariff regime, has led economists to "slash" their growth forecasts for the US.

The Mirror leads with a call to action from a mother-of-four in Gaza with its headline "our children are starving". Its front page shows a picture of destroyed buildings and Palestinians queueing for aid. The story is based on testimony from within Gaza secured by Save the Childen.

The paper says a group suspected of carrying out the hack is believed to be made up of thousands of teenagers from the UK and US.

The Daily Express focuses on the legal challenge by a transgender former judge to the Supreme Court's ruling on the definition of a woman. "Women's battle for safe spaces goes on" reads its headline. The report says Victoria McCloud is preparing to fight the ruling at the European Court of Human Rights, while noting she has the backing of the British Medical Association. It quotes the gender critical academic, Kathleen Stock, who calls Dr McCloud a "moron".

The Sun devotes its front page to a photo of the Prince and Catherine, Princess of Wales, known as the Duke and Duchess of Rothesay when in Scotland, beaming during a trip to Mull for their 14th wedding anniversary. "Wills and Kate on Love Island" says the headline.

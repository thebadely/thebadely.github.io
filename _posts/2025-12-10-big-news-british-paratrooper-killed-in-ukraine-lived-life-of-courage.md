Here’s what you need to know: A member of the UK armed forces who died in Ukraine has been named as Lance Corporal George Hooley of the Parachute Regiment.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer paid tribute to the 28-year-old paratrooper, saying he had lived a life "full of courage and determination".

"He served our country with honour and distinction around the world in the cause of freedom and democracy, including as part of the small number of British personnel in Ukraine."

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said he had been killed in a "tragic accident" while observing Ukrainian forces test "a new defensive capability, away from the front lines" on Tuesday.

Speaking in the House of Commons, Sir Keir said he had placed L/Cpl Hooley's name on record "to express our gratitude and respect, and to affirm that his service will never be forgotten".

L/Cpl Hooley had an "incredibly bright" future, his commanding officer said in a tribute on Wednesday.

"I have no doubt that he would have continued to perform at the very front of his peer group over the coming years," the commanding officer said, adding that "all members of the Parachute Regiment mourn his loss".

The 28-year-old's company commander added: "If you met George Hooley, you remembered it. His energy and enthusiasm were simply extraordinary.

"He provided spark that lifted others, a drive that inspired, and a zest for life that reminded us all how to live with purpose and joy. And we loved him for it. George had a rare gift: a deep kindness and genuine time for everyone."

He was "the model of professionalism" and a "born soldier", the company commander added.

"His colleagues will tell you that he wasn't just part of the team, he was the character within it. The glue. The laughter. The calm voice of sense. The soldier who made the hard days easy and the good days memorable."

The paratrooper was due to be promoted to Corporal in January and had been given the role's responsibilities on his deployment to Ukraine, the MoD said.

He had previously been deployed to Afghanistan, Africa and Eastern Europe.

Defence Secretary John Healey shared his condolences with L/Cpl Hooley's family and colleagues. 

He said: "He served our country with distinction. His tragic death reminds us of the courage and commitment with which our outstanding armed forces serve every day."

The BBC understands the incident is not thought to have been caused by hostile fire. 

A military source told the BBC two Ukrainian personnel were believed to have died in the incident, and several more were injured.

The weapons system being tested was said to be an armed interceptor drone, according to unconfirmed reports.

Ukraine's Ministry of Defence has been approached for comment.

It is not known what L/Cpl Hooley's role was in the country. This is the first time the presence of paratroopers in Ukraine has been confirmed.

The UK government has never disclosed the number of service people in Ukraine, but has previously acknowledged a small number is there to support Ukrainian armed forces and provide security to diplomatic personnel.

The Parachute Regiment is an airborne infantry regiment of the British Army.

It has not been confirmed in which battalion L/Cpl Hooley served. The first battalion is under the direction of special forces, while others are part of the Army's rapid response formation.

It is the first death of a UK service member in Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022.

The Parachute Regiment said it was mourning the death of the 28-year-old, who joined the British Army in November 2015.

He joined the Regiment in June 2016 after completing his training at the Infantry Training Centre Catterick in North Yorkshire, it said in a statement on social media.

A series of meetings to bring the war in Ukraine to an end have taken place in recent weeks, following interventions from US President Donald Trump and a range of European leaders.

Sir Keir told the Commons he had met Ukraine's President Zelensky in Downing Street on Monday, alongside France's President Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, as efforts to negotiate an end to the war intensify.

"We must redouble our efforts," he told the House.

"The UK, Europe and our allies will stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine, stand up to Putin's aggression and work to deliver a just and lasting peace."

Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, also speaking in the Commons, said: "The thoughts of the whole House will rightly be with family of Lance Corporal Hooley, who tragically died supporting Ukraine in her fight for freedom."

US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, who welcomed Healey to Washington DC for defence talks on Wednesday, also paid tribute to L/Cpl Hooley, saying: "It is a reflection of the sacrifice and commitment that so many make around the world."

Northern Ireland goalkeeper Bailey Peacock-Farrell feels Michael O'Neill's squad is "the strongest we've been" as they prepare for Friday's crunch World Cup qualifier away to Slovakia.

With all to play for still in Group A, Northern Ireland sit in third place, three points behind both Germany and Slovakia with their final game to come at home to Luxembourg on Monday at Windsor Park (19:45 GMT).

A repeat of October's home win over Slovakia would put them in a healthy position to secure at least second place in the group and a play-off spot.

Peacock-Farrell, who has won 52 international caps since making his debut in 2018 but is yet to play at a major tournament, feels this is perhaps his best chance yet.

"It's super exciting. The opportunity that we have is immense. I do believe we're the strongest we've been," said the 29-year-old.

"In terms of looking back you would have said that maybe just after we were hard done by after Euro 2016 in terms of the play-offs, but looking at the team now, it's exciting with so much energy, enthusiasm and just fearlessness.

"The level that everyone's playing at as well is high and I still believe that some of these players have got another couple of levels to go.

"I've got more to give as well. There's so much more ceiling as well for the squad that we can continue. These next games and the games after and maybe a tournament can only help elevate that as well."

The on-loan Blackpool goalkeeper came back into the starting team for the World Cup qualifiers due to a shoulder injury keeping Pierce Charles out of the last four games.

With Conor Hazard and Luke Southwood also waiting in the wings, competition for the number one jersey is fierce and Peacock-Farrell feels it is up to him to retain his place in the team.

"I've got that opportunity at this moment and Pierce got his opportunity when I was injured and took it and rightly so, fair play to him," he added.

"When Pierce comes back, we've got myself, Pierce, Conor and Luke. We've got a great group for Michael to pick, so it's a case of just doing what you can control and that's your performances at club level and when you have the Northern Ireland shirt on."

Northern Ireland's 2-0 win against Slovakia at Windsor Park is regarded as one of the best performances in either of Michael O'Neill's tenures.

However, there is no guarantee it will be a similar story in Kosice with Peacock-Farrell accepting he will potentially "be busier".

"They're going to have some key players back, we're missing a few key players but I think they'll also be wary that we put a lot of damage onto them in terms of how we knocked them down to reality after their high of beating Germany.

"We were incredible against Slovakia and felt hard done by against Germany. We're actually in pretty good form and playing really well.

"Away games in international football are tough but we're not worried about it, we're aware of their qualities as with every game but looking back at my entire career with Northern Ireland, I'm looking at this team and it's really, really promising and it's exciting. 

"There's so much belief and enthusiasm and overall ability as well in this team. It's great to be a part of."

According to new developments, Ruben Amorim has won 14 and lost 13 of his 34 games in charge of Manchester United since he replaced Erik ten Hag in November

Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says he can deal with issues created by not replacing Marcus Rashford and Antony because he believes his team will ultimately benefit.

Amorim did not feel either player suited his system or bought into his ideas.

After he let the attacking pair leave for Aston Villa and Real Betis on loan in the winter transfer window, Amorim opted against bringing in new faces to fill the gaps.

However, his strategy of trusting players already at the club has not been helped by the hamstring injury that has ruled out forward Joshua Zirkzee for the rest of the season.

United, who sit 15th in the Premier League, look destined to finish in their worst top-flight league position since they were relegated in 1973-74.

"In January we lost players and didn't bring in new ones," said the United boss. "That was a risk.

"But there are things here that are more important than scoring 10 more goals this season.

"We are trying to do something that is more important. We can hurt the squad now but in the future it will help the club."

Everyone wants to play for Man Utd - Amorim

Rashford doubts he will play for Man Utd again under Amorim

Following his appointment in November, Amorim said he had wanted to take the job at the end of the season but accepted an immediate appointment after being told it was "now or never".

The Portuguese acknowledges there have been moments when he has wondered whether he should have been braver in discussions with United chief executive Omar Berrada over that initial request to move from Sporting at the end of this campaign.

"If you ask me four months ago, with all the problems, maybe I have the feeling I should be stronger in saying I will start at the beginning of the season," said Amorim, whose team play Bournemouth on Sunday.

"But today, I am feeling it is something that is going to help us in the future.

"We are suffering a lot here. There is a lot of frustration but I feel, in this moment, maybe because we are near the end, this is the most important time, maybe, in the next few years.

"We are going to use all the information to prepare better the next few years, so [I have] no regrets."

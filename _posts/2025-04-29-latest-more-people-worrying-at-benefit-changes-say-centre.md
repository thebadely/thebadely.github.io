Here’s what you need to know: Staff at a centre which supports vulnerable people say they are seeing an increasing numbers of people come to them who are worried about large changes to the benefits system. 

In Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, @the Hub launched in June with volunteers offering people support on issues like benefits, housing and debt advice.

Independent town councillor Milly Boylan, who runs the site, said they were being "inundated" with concerned visitors. 

A Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) spokesperson said the government would never compromise on protecting people in need.

In March, the Labour government announced plans for major changes to the benefits system aimed at cutting the growing amount the UK spent on welfare.

Those changes would include stricter tests for personal independence payments (PIP) and the halving of incapacity benefits under universal credit for new claimants.

"We are seeing a lot of people coming in who are struggling - we've had people get in touch who are absolutely petrified," Boylan said. 

"Some people are concerned specifically about their PIP potentially going down. 

"Then there's concern over this migration on to universal credit and how that will work - we've had extra training to try and help people who are coming in but we know there's some who will be excluded from PIP payments under the new rules. 

"It's crippling for people." 

One of the regulars at the hub is 64-year-old Les Mifflin, a former kitchen porter who ended up homeless after the breakdown of a relationship. 

Due to ill health he currently gets a PIP payment but if the changes come into force, he said he would face a significant cut. 

"I will be impacted by what they are looking to do, that's my understanding of it," he said. 

"That will make life a lot harder for me - the cost of everything is going up so I can't afford them to cut it.

"I can't work due to my health, I'm a diabetic too.

"I've been coming here for around seven months; I feel safe here but I don't feel safe by what the government wants to do."

The hub has had 5,000 visits since they opened with the list of regulars rising from 220 people in the winter to about 280 now. 

The centre exists largely on donations and is currently fundraising to try and expand its offer.

Zena, 35, is a single mum who described the hub as a "lifeline" for people who are struggling. 

"It's a real relief, actually, to have somewhere like this in the community where you get welcomed in," she said. 

"I'm not a very sociable person but when I come here I know there is help available if I need it." 

Ministers want to save £4.8bn by reducing the benefits bill with a consultation set to run into June. 

Overall the government estimates 3.2 million families will be worse off as a result of the reforms by 2030 while 3.8 million families will be better off.

The DWP spokesperson said: "We have been clear that protecting people in need is a principle we will never compromise on.

"The social security system will always be there for those with severe health conditions, and we will introduce a new premium for those who will never be able to work."

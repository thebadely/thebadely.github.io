It has been recently reported that Snow and ice warnings are covering much of the UK over the weekend and beyond.

Yellow snow and ice warnings are in place across Scotland, the south-west, north-west and east coast of England, and Wales and Northern Ireland, until Monday.

Heavy snowfall has already covered parts of Scotland, with the Met Office predicting up to 40cm (15in) there and 5cm across England and Wales.

Daytime temperatures are expected to remain in the low single figures for much of the country, and below freezing in parts of northern Scotland.

Travel delays and cancellations, disruption on the roads and power cuts are expected. 

Amber warnings, covering parts of the north east, Highland, Perth and Kinross, Shetland and Angus have expired at midday on Saturday.

ScotRail has warned that trains could be cancelled or delayed, and the Highland Council has urged people not to travel unless "absolutely necessary".

Large parts of England, Wales and Scotland have started 2026 with very chilly conditions, as cold Arctic air forces temperatures across the UK to plummet. 

On Friday night, the Met Office expects sub-zero temperatures to blanket the country, including minimum temperatures of -6C to -8C across much of Scotland, and -4C to -5C in rural areas of England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

With temperatures only scraping above zero across the UK on Saturday, snow showers are forecast in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the south-west and east coast of England, while winter sunshine is expected elsewhere.

Yellow alerts for snow and ice continue on Sunday and Monday across many of the areas of the UK covered earlier in the weekend, with the last ending on Monday afternoon.

A full list of affected areas is available from the forecaster.

Some areas of Scotland have already experienced disruption: ScotRail has cancelled some rail services and there have been issues on the roads and ferries.

Meanwhile, multiple crashes were reported in Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire, National Highways said, with motorists urged to seek alternative routes were possible.

People are being urged to plan routes carefully and to pack essentials in your car in the event of delays. Key items to bring include warm clothing, water, a blanket and ice-scraper.

Health Secretary Wes Streeting has warned that the "bitingly cold snap" will put extra pressure on NHS hospitals and has urged people to only attend A&E for emergencies. 

The UK Health Security Agency has issued warnings across England, which are in place until 9 January.

Its amber cold health alert means the weather is expected to have a severe impact across health and social care services.

The alert has been issued for the East Midlands, West Midlands, North East, North West, South East, South West, East of England, Yorkshire and the Humber, and London.

The predicted temperatures can have a serious impact on the health of some people, leading to increased risk of heart attacks, strokes and chest infections, particularly for individuals over the age of 65 and those with pre-existing health conditions, according to the UKSA.

There is also an increased risk of falls due to the icy weather.

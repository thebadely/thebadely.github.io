It has been recently reported that Stocks of baby wipes and nappies for newborn babies have run out across a network of baby banks in London, a charity has warned. 

Little Village said that the essential items had run out across its hubs in Camden, Tooting and Brent and its Wandsworth warehouse. 

The charity, which supported 7,325 babies and children up to the age of five last year, reported that demand for its services was increasing.

Emily Compston, from Little Village, said: "Tomorrow a parent may have to choose between buying food or keeping their baby clean and dry â€“ no family should face that kind of impossible decision. Nappies are not a luxury; they are a necessity."

It is appealing for donations of newborn nappies, size one nappies and baby wipes at its hubs.

The charity said that it had provided 64% more packs of nappies in the first half of 2025 than in the same time period in 2024.

Renata Acioli, a baby bank manager at Little Village, said: "I meet families who are doing everything they can but still don't have enough in their pockets to cover the most essential items for their baby.

"It breaks my heart hearing stories of mums and dads having to resort to nappy and formula rationing."

On average, a newborn uses about 10 nappies a day, meaning families typically go through about three packs a week.

Experts revealed that Former world champion Golovkin won 42 pro bouts, 37 by knockout, with two losses and one draw 

Boxing great Gennady Golovkin will run to become president of World Boxing, aiming to safeguard the sport's Olympic future.

Boxing was initially left off the Los Angeles 2028 programme after the International Boxing Association (IBA) was expelled from the Olympic movement.

A new federation, World Boxing, was formed to restore the sport's Olympic standing and earned provisional recognition by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in February, securing boxing's place at LA 2028.

"With your trust, I will work to secure boxing's Olympic future, restore global confidence and ensure that every federation, coach and athlete - no matter how small or far away - has a fair chance to grow," Golovkin, 43, said.

Kazakhstan's Golovkin, an Olympic silver medallist, held a middleweight world title and is widely regarded as one of the fiercest competitors of his generation.

Although not officially retired, he has not fought since losing the third fight of his trilogy with Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez in September 2022.

The only blemishes on his 45-fight record are two defeats by Alvarez, following a controversial draw in their first encounter that many believed Golovkin won.

The IOC organised boxing at the Tokyo 2020 and Paris 2024 Olympics after suspending the IBA in 2019 over governance, financial, refereeing and ethical concerns.

The election in Rome on 23 November will see current World Boxing president Boris van der Vorst step aside, having confirmed he will not seek a second term.

"Our mission for 2026 is clear: to achieve full IOC recognition and guarantee our place in Los Angeles 2028 and Brisbane 2032," Golovkin added.

"But beyond recognition lies a greater purpose - to rebuild our reputation as one united boxing family, guided by respect, transparency and unity."

Golovkin's challenger for the position is Greece's Mariolis Charilaos, who led the Hellenic Boxing Federation from 2021 to 2025 and oversaw key governance reforms.

"Boxing was born in Greece and was among the first Olympic sports, Charilaos said.  

"From ancient Olympia to the modern Games, it has never ceased to teach the values of strength, endurance and fair play. These values form the core of my vision for World Boxing."

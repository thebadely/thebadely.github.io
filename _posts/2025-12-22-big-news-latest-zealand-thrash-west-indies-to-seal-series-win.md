Scorecard

New Zealand bowled West Indies out for 138 to win the third Test by 323 runs and complete a 2-0 series victory.

West Indies resumed on 43-0 in Mount Maunganui, needing an unlikely record total of 462 for victory, but slumped from 87-0 to 112-8 either side of lunch.

New Zealand fast bowler Jacon Duffy took 5-42 and spinner Ajaz Patel 3-23 as the visitors lost 10 wickets for 51 runs, with the Test ending just after tea.

"It was a pretty clinical performance," said New Zealand captain Tom Latham. 

"Winning the toss, batting first, being able to get close to 600 - it's the perfect blueprint.

"And then obviously doing what we did with the ball. The guys playing the way they did was obviously really pleasing."

The win moves New Zealand into second place behind Australia in the World Test Championship standings.

New Zealand led by 155 runs after their first innings of 575-8 declared then set West Indies the record run chase when declaring on 306-2 in their second innings.

Latham and fellow opener Devon Conway became the first openers in the history of Test cricket to score centuries in both innings as they put their side in a commanding position.

Conway, who scored 227 and 100, became the 10th batter in Test history to score a double hundred and a hundred in the same game, while Duffy took 23 wickets in the three-match series.

West Indies captain Roston Chase made just two and five in the third Test to complete a difficult series during which he scored only 42 runs and took three wickets.

"I think I had a tough series, very below par for my standards," said Chase. "I didn't really lead from the front on the field.

"Leading in terms of words and encouraging and inspiring the team, that was all good and well, but in terms of going out there and producing for the team, I thought I let myself down and the team down as well."

British pair Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski booked their place in the semi-finals of the men's doubles at the US Open after beating Czech duo Tomas Machac and Matej Vocel.

Salisbury and Skupski came through the quarter-final 7-6 (8-6) 6-3 to take a step closer to claiming a first Grand Slam title since teaming up.

The Englishmen, who lost the French Open final in June, will face India's Yuki Bhambri and New Zealand's Michael Venus in the last four.

Machac and Vocel saved five break points in a tight opening set but came unstuck in the tie-break.

The second set was wrapped up in just 39 minutes, with a couple of breaks helping the sixth seeds over the line.

Salisbury, 33, has previously tasted success at the US Open - winning three successive men's doubles titles between 2021 and 2023 alongside American Rajeev Ram.

Elsewhere, American Taylor Townsend and Czech Katerina Siniakova beat Russia's Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens of Belgium to reach the women's doubles final.

The top seeds, who claimed the Australian Open title together in January, won 6-3 7-6 (7-3) and are yet to drop a set.

They will meet Canada's Gabriela Dabrowski and New Zealand's Erin Routliffe, who sealed a 6-4 6-3 win against Italian duo Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini, in Friday's final.

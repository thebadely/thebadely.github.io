Here’s what you need to know: Carlos Alcaraz is a six-time Grand Slam champion

Amateur players will have the chance to win A$1m when they face tennis' top professionals - including world number one Carlos Alcaraz - in a single-point showdown before January's Australian Open.

Organisers of the year's first Grand Slam have announced the Million Dollar One Point Slam, which will pit 10 amateur players against 22 professionals in a knockout tournament at Melbourne Park.

Players will play 'rock, paper, scissors' to determine who serves or receives, and whoever wins the point will progress to the next round.

The winner of the event will take home Â£490,000.

Players who reached the semi-finals of the men's or women's singles main draw in the 2025 Australian Open won A$1.1m (Â£540,000).

The US Open staged a revamped, standalone mixed doubles tournament in August which encouraged top singles players to participate, with the winners receiving $1m (Â£737,000).

The Australian Open held its inaugural One Point Slam event this year, but the prize fund was A$60,000 (Â£29,400) and it generated little publicity.

Andrey Rublev was the only top-10 player involved, and his run came to an end when he put the one and only serve allowed into the net in his quarter-final.

Australian professional Omar Jasika won the One Point Slam, which pitted 16 amateurs - eight men and eight women aged between 15 and 72 - against 16 professionals.

Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley said: "Whether you're an amateur or a pro, the ultimate winner will walk away with the prize. Entries will open soon at clubs across the country."

Tiley said there were "more big names to be announced soon", while the Australian Open website said "celebrities" would be involved.

Organisers have not said exactly how the event will work, but it is expected to follow a similar format to this year's edition.

The professionals were allowed to serve once and the amateurs twice - as is the norm in traditional tennis.

While it is unclear how the draw will work, there will be five knockout rounds and the venue will be the Rod Laver Arena rather than the smaller Kia Arena.

The final stages will take place in a night session instead of 1pm local time.

Any Australians - or international players who have registered with Tennis Australia - can enter 'One Point Slam' events at their local tennis clubs.

The winners of the grassroots tournaments will then go into a draw, with one amateur player from every state and territory selected to take part in the 'grand finale' in a night session on Wednesday, 14 January.

There will also be a qualifying draw in December which amateurs, lower ranked pros, celebrities and sport stars can enter.

It starts on Monday, 12 January and the two winners will go into Wednesday's 'grand finale' with the other eight amateurs and 10 professionals.

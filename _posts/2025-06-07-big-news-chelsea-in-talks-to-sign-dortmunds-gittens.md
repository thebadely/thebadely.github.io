It has been recently reported that Jamie Gittens spent two years in Manchester City's youth system

Chelsea are in talks to sign Borussia Dortmund's Jamie Gittens and have offered the winger a seven-year contract.

The 20-year-old is understood to be open to a move to Stamford Bridge amid ongoing talks over personal terms, though a fee has yet to be agreed between the two clubs.

The Blues are ready to pay Â£30m but Dortmund are keen to hold out for more than Â£40m.

Chelsea are not in a rush to force through any deal for England Under-21 international with other targets on the market, as they seek a right-footed left winger after signing striker Liam Delap from Ipswich.

They could wait until after the upcoming Club World Cup, which features both Chelsea and Dortmund, to try and complete the signing should there be a lack of progress in the coming days.

Gittens came through Manchester City's academy before joining Dortmund in 2020.

He made his Bundesliga debut two years later, and last season scored eight goals in 32 league appearances.

However, he does not fit the system of manager Niko Kovac, who joined Dortmund in February.

While Gittens could be an arrival, a deal for AC Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan looks increasingly unlikely with the Italian side refusing to budge on their Â£25m valuation of the France international.

excerpt: "Blues manager Enzo Maresca hints that having some more experience in his squad would be beneficial following their comeback to earn a point at Newcast"

It has been recently reported that Maresca joined Chelsea from Leicester City for Â£10m in July 2024

Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca insisted that speculation around his future would not distract his squad before facing Newcastle - but that was not how it looked for 45 minutes on Saturday.

Even before kick-off, Maresca appeared to question Chelsea's focus on buying only youth, suggesting having more experienced players is "invaluable".

The Blues then did not get going at St James' Park, a ground where they had lost 15 times in the Premier League era, and found themselves 2-0 down through a pair of first-half goals from striker Nick Woltemade.

So poor was the first half that Chelsea gave up an expected goals figure of 1.97 - their worst in a first 45 minutes for more than two years. They were error-prone at the back, wasteful in possession, out battled and failed to register a shot on target.

The lack of performance was staggering given Chelsea had produced an accomplished display when beating Everton at home last weekend. That form was more in evidence after the break as they roared back through an outstanding 25-yard free-kick from Reece James and a brilliant individual goal from Joao Pedro.

Despite the improvement by Chelsea they were still reliant on a key call going their way as Newcastle controversially saw penalty shouts waved away moments before Pedro equalised when Trevoh Chalobah clattered into Anthony Gordon in the box.

It felt at times that Maresca's post-match comments from last week - in which he said "many people" had caused his "worst 48 hours" since joining the club - were continuing to impact the players.

Since those comments, the Italian had been linked with Manchester City - speculation he labelled "100 per cent" unfounded - and had his relationship with the hierarchy continually to be questioned.

He also offered some thoughts on the make-up of his squad prior to the match that suggested he would welcome a bit more experience.

Earlier in the week, he said: "I love the squad, I love young players" and before kick-off he told TNT: "I'm very happy. I just focus on what I can control - pitch-side - knowing that there is always noise you need to manage."

However, he then added: "When you have 20 and 21-year-olds and a player who is 30 or 31, and he starts to say something to them, it's invaluable. But it's the strategy of the club."

Was this just another example of Maresca lowering expectations and highlighting what part of the project was in his control? 

He was also fighting for the players, even earning a booking for dissent in the second half as they managed a creditable fightback.

This was only the fourth time in the Premier League that Chelsea avoided defeat having been two or more goals down at half-time. Ultimately both teams had chances to win in an entertaining end to the match.  

Yet, despite Maresca showing his commitment, it remains an open question  whether this ongoing power struggle could affect Chelsea's players going forward.

It seems Maresca has made an already difficult job even harder by putting his complaints â albeit cryptically â into the public domain.

His comments highlight that Maresca, who only three weeks ago saw his team labelled as title contenders, thinks inconsistency is to be expected with such a young squad.

Chelsea's squad is indeed extremely young, they have both the youngest average squad age and average age of the starting 11 in the division. 

Maresca says the goal for the season is simply to improve on last year, when they finished fourth, qualified for the Champions League and won both the Club World Cup and Conference League.

That is reflected behind the scenes among the hierarchy, with Champions League qualification again the priority. A title tilt is not expected though not ruled out.

Chelsea remain in fourth place after the draw but inconsistency is sucking them into a battle for European places with half of the Premier League, and they would be 10 points off the leaders if Arsenal win later on Saturday.

The Blues also beat Cardiff City in the Carabao Cup quarter-final on Tuesday, but they likely need to beat both Pafos and Napoli in their final two Champions League matches and have other results go in their favour to avoid a play-off round match in February. 

After the match, Maresca said "yes, for sure," when asked whether older players are important to handling loud atmospheres like that at St James' Park but added: "I think the other ones we have are also doing a great job in this aspect."

He then explained: "My message at the end of the game is, for sure in the first half we could do better, but the character they showed in the second half should make them proud. My last week has not been complicated. It has been good. 

"We beat Everton, we beat Cardiff and we drew Newcastle away. So in terms of results, I am happy. Again, there are things that for sure we can do better. But I think we are going in the right direction."

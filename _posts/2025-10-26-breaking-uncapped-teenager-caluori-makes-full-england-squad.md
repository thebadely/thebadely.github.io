Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Noah Caluori represented England at the under-20s World Cup in the summer

Uncapped Saracens wing Noah Caluori is among the players named in Steve Borthwick's 36-man England squad for the autumn internationals.

Caluori, 19, was invited to train with England last week after scoring five tries on his full Premiership debut in Saracens' win over Sale, but now makes the full international squad.

Sale pair Tom Curry and Raffi Quirke are also back in the squad after injury issues but Leicester forward Emeka Ilione misses out with a shoulder problem.

England begin their autumn internationals against Australia at Twickenham on next Saturday (15:10 GMT).

"Our focus is on making the most of the time we have together as we approach what will be a fiercely competitive series," Borthwick said.

"Facing Australia in the opening match will be a great test against a team that has been training and playing together for some time and is one of the in-form teams in the world."

Scrum-half Quirke won two caps under former England coach Eddie Jones four years ago but a succession of injuries halted the 24-year-old's progress.

Club-mate Curry had an operation on a long-standing wrist ligament injury after helping the British and Irish Lions to a successful series win in Australia over the summer.

Former captain Owen Farrell misses out as expected.

After beginning the series against Australia, England will also face Fiji, New Zealand and Argentina this autumn.

India win the final ODI by 13 runs at Chester-le-Street to seal 2-1 series win

England have played their final competitive one-day international before the Women's World Cup starts at the end of September.

A summer which started with a 3-0 win against a depleted West Indies culminated with a 2-1 defeat at the hands of a vastly superior India and has left coach Charlotte Edwards with plenty to ponder as she selects her squad for the tournament.

In the final ODI England fell short chasing a record 319 at Chester-le-Street, having comfortably won a rain-reduced encounter in the second match at Lord's.

There are serious questions surrounding the balance of England's XI and concerns with their fielding.

Considering England's margin of defeat on Tuesday was 13 runs, after another display littered with misfields, fumbles and poor throws, it proved the difference between the sides.

In contrast, India dived, raced across the outfield and took some cracking catches as the game reached its climax.

England captain Nat Sciver-Brunt said in her post-match interview that "some people maybe seem surprised that the ball is coming to them" but also repeatedly insisted, alongside Edwards, that the players are "working extremely hard" on their fielding.

Although Sciver-Brunt is in fine form with the bat, scoring an exquisite 98 in England's chase, her inability to bowl as she recovers from an Achilles problem has left a big void in England's team, one which they have attempted to plug in a variety of ways.

She is expected to be fit to play as an all-rounder in the World Cup, but that in itself carries risk as her first competitive bowling since January's Ashes in such a high-pressure environment.

England's all-round stocks seem depleted - Alice Davidson-Richards played in the ODIs but did not bowl, power-hitting fast bowlers Dani Gibson and Freya Kemp are on the way back from injuries, and Alice Capsey, a top-order batter who offers part-time spin, has struggled to take her chances in internationals recently.

"I'm getting there," Edwards told BBC Test Match Special when asked whether she knew her best team.

"After the West Indies, it was really easy to think of an XI, but now I'm genuinely really close to what I think we'll start with in India.

"I want to win, but I've learned more from this than I would have than had we won 3-0.

"Then we'd be going into a World Cup where we'd not have had these experiences and exposure to the pressure that we have been under."

England well beaten as India take ODI series win

BBC Sport and BBC TMS commentators have picked their teams for the opening World Cup game. Here's who they selected:

England World Cup winner Alex Hartley: Jones, Beaumont, Knight, Sciver-Brunt, Dunkley, Gibson, Ecclestone, Dean, Cross, Filer, Bell.

"I've gone with this team because I feel like the wickets will be pretty flat at the start of the competition, so I've gone with the extra seamer.

"As soon as the wickets start to deteriorate and if the games become slower scoring, they'll need an extra spinner and that will be Sarah Glenn. I would take her as part of the wider squad because she offers something different as a leg-spinner."

BBC cricket reporter and commentator Henry Moeran: Jones, Beaumont, Knight, Sciver-Brunt, Dunkley, Wyatt-Hodge, Capsey, Ecclestone, Dean, Filer, Bell.

"The opening partnership has been solid so that has to stay put, and Heather Knight comes straight back into the side for her batting and additional leadership experience.

"Sophia Dunkley has looked in good touch. As a bit of a wildcard, I'd bring Danni Wyatt-Hodge back. She plays spin well and has a good record of playing in World Cups.

"Alice Capsey possibly comes in more for her bowling as England will need the spin options, but they also need more batting depth, which she provides too."

Former England spinner Dani Hazell: Jones, Beaumont, Knight, Sciver-Brunt, Dunkley, Wyatt-Hodge, Ecclestone, Dean, Smith, Bell, Filer.

"A fit Nat Sciver-Brunt bowling makes a huge difference. I'd take four spinners.

"Linsey Smith would be in the side and Wyatt-Hodge would come back in at six or seven, where she can play spin well and have a real impact on the game.

"Smith can just hold the stumps. The pitches get a bit slower and lower later in the game and, if the batters play across the line to her, they'll be in trouble."

BBC chief cricket reporter Stephan Shemilt: Beaumont, Jones, Lamb, Sciver-Brunt, Knight, Kemp, Gibson, Dean, Ecclestone, Smith/Bell, Filer.

"There is quite a big doubt over Gibson but she balances the team beautifully if fit to bowl. Kemp is yet to fulfil her potential, but I want her power and left-handedness, even if that is tough on Davidson-Richards.

"Emma Lamb has taken her chance, so squeezes out Sophia Dunkley. I like the batting depth and bowling options of this team, with the choice between Linsey Smith and Lauren Bell dependant on conditions. The crying shame is Capsey, who should be in but has missed her opportunities."

BBC Sport journalist Ffion Wynne: Beaumont, Jones, Lamb, Knight, Sciver-Brunt, Dunkley, Gibson, Ecclestone, Dean, Bell, Filer.

"There is a risk with Gibson considering her recent injury but she gives England some much-needed versatility as a power-hitting number seven, a brilliant fielder and another bowling option.

"I would also have Smith in the squad so, pitch-dependent in India, she could slot in for Lauren Filer or Lauren Bell, as Gibson and Sciver-Brunt would be the other seamers.

"I'd have liked to see England try more of Emma Lamb's spin during this recent series, but she has been in sparkling batting form so keeps her spot at three, with Heather Knight jumping straight back in." 

Durham batter and BBC Test Match Special commentator Emily Windsor: Jones, Beaumont, Knight, Sciver-Brunt, Dunkley, Bouchier, Davidson-Richards, Dean, Ecclestone, Smith, Bell.

"Heather Knight comes straight back in and Sciver-Brunt is bowling in this team, which is going to be crucial because it allows the extra batter in Maia Bouchier, which will be key in India.

"I'd have Davidson-Richards at seven. She's a very smart player and she could also be put in ahead of Bouchier if England are under the pump. I'd like to see her bowling too.

"Filer was close but, with Sciver-Brunt bowling, I've gone with Bell for her death skills."

'An unbelievable feeling to play for Scotland'

Nottingham Forest are to rename a stand at the City Ground to honour their "great hero" John Robertson, who died at the age of 72 this week.

Robertson scored the only goal when the club retained the European Cup by beating Hamburg in 1980, having also delivered the cross from which Trevor Francis netted the winner the previous season against Malmo.

The winger also won the First and Second Division titles, the Uefa Super Cup, two Football League Cups, the 1978 FA Charity Shield and the Anglo-Scottish Cup with Forest.

Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis said the John Robertson Stand would be a "lasting recognition of his extraordinary contribution to our club".

"This week is one of profound sadness for everyone connected with Nottingham Forest as we come together to mourn the passing of John Robertson - a true legend of this great club in every sense of the word," Marinakis said in a statement.

"I extend my sincerest condolences to his family, his friends, and all who loved him.

"Today, I have recommended to the Board that the Bridgford Stand be renamed 'The John Robertson Stand' in his honour and in lasting recognition of his extraordinary contribution to our club, so that his legacy - and our great hero - will forever be remembered."

The City Ground already has stands named after former manager Brian Clough and former goalkeeper and assistant manager Peter Taylor. 

In 2015, Robertson topped a poll by the Nottingham Post of fans' all-time favourite Forest players.

He also earned 28 caps for Scotland, scoring a winning goal against England in 1981, and also netted against New Zealand at the 1982 World Cup.

He went on to become former Forest team-mate Martin O'Neill's assistant manager at Wycombe Wanderers, Norwich City, Leicester City, Celtic and Aston Villa.

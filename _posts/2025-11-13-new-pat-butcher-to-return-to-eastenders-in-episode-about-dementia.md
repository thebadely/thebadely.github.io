It has been recently reported that EastEnders favourite Pat Evans, formerly Pat Butcher, is to return to the BBC soap for a one-off comeback episode over the Christmas period.

The character, played by Pam St Clement, was beloved by viewers for more than 25 years for her no-nonsense personality and memorable taste in earrings.

Pat died in 2012, but was later seen on-screen again with Dame Barbara Windsor, when she returned as a figment of the dying Peggy's imagination in 2016.

She will now similarly come back, acting alongside Paul Bradley as Nigel, whose memories take him back to the 90s, as part of a storyline about his dementia next month. 

"I was both surprised and excited to be asked back to tread the streets of Walford once again and to be involved in Nigel's touching dementia storyline," St Clement, 83, said.

"It was lovely to be welcomed back by those with whom I had worked for so long. It was just like coming home."

Pat returns to help Nigel when his dementia symptoms intensify, following an emotional evening at his festive film screening.

St Clement first appeared in EastEnders in 1986 and was at the heart of the drama in Albert Square until her character's death.

EastEnders executive producer Ben Wadey said: "It's an honour and a privilege to welcome Pam St Clement back to EastEnders for a special episode in Nigel's ongoing dementia storyline.

"Pat Evans is one of the most cherished and iconic characters to have graced the streets of Walford, and I know I speak on behalf of everyone when I say what a delight it was to see Pat and Pam back in The Queen Vic, as she helps Nigel in his time of need."

Pat is one of a number of classic characters who have made a return to Walford.

Anita Dobson's Queen Vic landlady Angie Watts made a surprise return to visit her daughter Sharon, as she drifted in and out of consciousness in the show's 40th anniversary episode in February.

Cindy Beale (Michelle Collins) and Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan) are back in the Square, while Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) and Chrissie Watts (Tracy-Ann Oberman) made recent short-term comebacks.

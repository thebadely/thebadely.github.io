Best tries from Women's Rugby World Cup pool stage

One-sided matches at the Women's World Cup are part of the sport's journey and fans will never complain about "too many tries", according to the competition director.

The group stage concluded on Sunday, with seven of the top eight sides according to world rankings progressing to the quarter-finals, which start this weekend.

The World Cup has expanded to 16 teams for the first time this tournament, and it resulted in some one-sided scorelines.

The widest margin of victory came as hosts England beat amateur side Samoa 92-3, while a third of the games - eight of 24 - had winning margins of 50 or more points.

Yvonne Nolan, competition director, said the group matches were "all very different and entertaining".

"We are saying goodbye to eight amazing teams," she said. "The World Cup is about more than knockouts and finals, but about growing the game.

"They have inspired a whole new wave of fans, and on the rugby side they have shown they are ready to step up."

Nolan cited tournament debutants Brazil, who lost all three of their games by margins of at least 60 points but who scored in every game, and Fiji, who beat Wales 28-25 for their first win at this year's tournament. 

Nolan said there will be plans announced next week in order to give more opportunities to minnows between tournaments.

"If we expect teams to turn up only every four years we will not see change," she said.

"We have seen where opportunities exist, teams can make changes and improvements quickly."

South Africa, the lowest-ranked side remaining at number 12 in the world, face perennial champions New Zealand in the quarter-finals.

England, the top-ranked team and tournament favourites, face a Scotland side wracked by contract disputes and an uncertain future.

"Even at stadiums where we have seen teams scoring their 10th or 11th try, no-one is leaving," Nolan said. "No-one ever says there are too many tries.

"Avid fans might want more arm wrestles, but I want a bit of everything."

More than 245,000 fans attended the group games.

Here’s what you need to know: Four MPs who were suspended from the Labour Party after rebelling against welfare reforms have had their whips restored.

Chris Hinchliff, for North East Hertfordshire, was suspended alongside Neil Duncan-Jordan, MP for Poole, Brian Leishman, MP for Alloa and Grangemouth, and Rachael Maskell, MP for York Central, after they voted against the government's Welfare Reform Bill in July.

The BBC understands they had the whip restored after discussions with chief whip Jonathan Reynolds on Friday.

Hinchliff said: "As ever, my focus remains on serving the communities of North East Hertfordshire and contributing to Labour's historic mission to create a society that puts people and nature before profit."

Prior to their suspensions, all four MPs had rebelled against the government on several occasions. 

The group were among 47 Labour MPs who rebelled against the government's proposed cuts to welfare in July and forced ministers to water down their plans.

The rebellion undermined Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's authority, which was weakened after a series of policy reversals, including restoring the Winter Fuel Payment to millions of pensioners.

At the time of their suspension, Starmer said he was "determined" to change the country "for the better". 

He said: "Therefore, we have to deal with people who repeatedly break the whip."

Hinchliff said he welcomed the whip back and added he had "constructive discussions" with the new chief whip in recent months.

Duncan-Jordan said he was "glad" to have the whip restored. 

"I've been part of the Labour and trade union movement for 40 years, so I'm pleased to have had the Labour whip restored today.

"I'll continue working hard for my constituents in Poole and standing up for Labour values - tackling poverty, raising living standards and building a fairer society," he added.  

Maskell said she was "grateful" that she had been given the whip back. 

"I recognise the heavy responsibility on Labour to repair our public services and economy after 14 disastrous years and above all to lift people out of poverty. 

"With 4.5m children living in poverty tonight, I am focused on ensuring they have the very best start in life," she added. 

The move comes as the party faces a difficult month in government with growing concern among Labour MPs that taxes will have to rise in the upcoming budget. 

Newly elected Labour deputy leader, Lucy Powell, urged the government not to raise taxes in the next budget. 

Powell told the BBC the government "should be following through" on its manifesto pledge not to raise income tax, national tax or VAT.

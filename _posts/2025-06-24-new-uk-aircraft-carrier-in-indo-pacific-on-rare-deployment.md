According to new developments, A British aircraft carrier has docked in Singapore on a rare Indo-Pacific deployment which will see it call on Australia, Japan, Korea and take part in several multinational exercises.

HMS Prince of Wales' visit comes weeks after two Chinese aircraft carriers concluded simultaneous drills in the region, in an unprecedented move prompting Japan's protest.

The carrier strike group's commander James Blackmore says he does not expect conflict with Chinese counterparts, noting the UK and China each "has every right to sail its ships in international sea space".

"I almost expect they'll want to come and want to watch what we're doing... Lots of other parties will wish to witness what we're doing," he tells the BBC.

"But I do recognise it will be safe and professional. That's the way we operate in the maritime."

Just last week, China had criticised another British warship HMS Spey's passage through the Taiwan Strait as an act of "intentional provocation" that "undermines peace and stability". 

HMS Spey is one of two British warships - the other being HMS Tamar - permanently on patrol in the Indo-Pacific. 

HMS Prince of Wales, which docked in Singapore on Monday, is one of the UK Navy's largest ships with a flight deck large enough to fit three football pitches. 

During its eight-month deployment, HMS Prince of Wales will be supported by ships from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Norway and Spain, among others. 

The deployment begins with around 2,500 military personnel and will grow to over 4,500 for some key exercises. 

The warship's presence in the Indo-Pacific also comes at a time when Washington has become more unpredictable, which introduces uncertainty to military alliances in the region.

For instance, it is now reviewing its multi-billion dollar submarine deal with the UK and Australia.

Asked how crucial the Aukus pact is to his carrier strike group's mission, Commodore Blackmore declined to comment, noting that the deal is "being entirely dealt with at a government to government level". 

The group is headed down under next month to participate in an Australia-led exercise which will involve the US and other regional militaries.

It will then sail through the Philippine Sea to Japan, where it will support Japanese authorities in developing the country's F-35 capability, Commodore Blackmore says.

HMS Prince of Wales' deployment demonstrates the UK's commitment to the region, he adds. 

"It's about upholding a rules-based international order and recognising the importance of trade between a free and open Indo-Pacific and the European theatre," he says.

On its way home in September, HMS Prince of Wales will take part in the annual warfighting exercise of the Five Power Defence Arrangements - referring to defence pacts between Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and the UK established in 1971. 

The last time a UK aircraft carrier joined these drills was in 1971.

Let's dive into the details: The lights are up and the baubles are out: with trees across the country already decorated and on display, there has been some traditional grumbling about whether commercialism means it gets earlier every year. 

But there's no right or wrong time to get into the festive spirit, according to viewers of BBC Breakfast, who debated whether the show had "gone too early" by putting up its tree on the first day of December.

It wasn't too early for Rebecca from the West Midlands, who sent in a picture of her tree that had gone up in August, or Jill who put up hers last weekend as it had "rained all day" and decorating "cheered her up".

If you're following Christian traditions then you might put your Christmas tree and decorations up on the first day of Advent, which is the fourth Sunday before the 25th. 

This year that fell on 30 November, meaning the festivities could officially start before December. 

Really, the day you put your tree up is down to you and your preferences. For some, the festive season begins the second the spooky season ends, with trees going up straight after Halloween, but for others this may be a lot later. 

In Norway, for example, it's tradition for trees to go up on 23 December.

How you decorate the tree itself is also a matter of personal preference - some put on every decoration they can find, whereas for others it's a more refined exercise. 

Kate Harrison, who has studied how colour impacts feelings, says you should decorate according to the atmosphere you want to create in your home.

But first she says you need to make sure you put everything on in a specific order to make your tree look "balanced".

Her advice is "lights first, then ribbon or garlands, then large baubles, then smaller pieces."

When it comes to colour, she suggests bright colours to invoke joy, and soft greens, whites and champagne colours to create calm.

Kate says colours such as red and gold are associated with nostalgia and jewel tones or deep, rich shades feel more magical.

You should then pick two main colours and one accent colour – for example, red, gold and green.

"Great décor is about contrast.

"Combine matte and shiny baubles, add ribbon or natural materials, and use plenty of warm lights for depth and atmosphere," she says.

An artificial tree – but only if it is used for seven to 20 years, depending on the material – should be better environmentally than buying a new, commercially grown tree every year, according to the Carbon Trust. 

BBC Radio 6 Music breakfast host Nick Grimshaw says he's bought a fake one for the first time this year, mainly because "his real one would often die "half way through December". He says he was surprised at how real it looks.

"So much so that one of our friends came round and went 'I love your tree, it smells amazing'", he joked.

Kate Harrison says how you decorate your tree also depends on whether it's real or fake.

For a real tree, she suggests "lighter decorations and glass, wood, paper or dried fruit for an organic look" whilst placing heavier pieces close to the trunk.

Whereas the "stronger branches" of fake trees "are perfect for heavier ornaments and structured ribbon, and can take bolder colours such as metallics.

If you are opting for a real tree, Annie Dellbridge, garden manager at Fullers Mill Garden, says before bringing it indoors you should water your tree generously. If you have a cut tree, recut the base to allow the tree to soak up water.

"If you are putting the tree in a stand, make sure it is one with a water reservoir under it and not just a criss-cross one, because then it gets no goodness whatsoever."

From then, Annie recommends watering the tree every day to help prevent pine needles from falling out too quickly. 

To help with the pine needle drop, she also advises putting it in a cooler part of your house, away from radiators or open fire. 

One of the difficulties you face when buying a tree is knowing how long it's been on display in a supermarket or garden centre, so Shaun Gagie, a gardener who appeared on BBC Two's Big Allotment Challenge, advises buying one which is already growing in a pot.

The downside, he says, is that they are "more expensive", but if you have a garden you can plant it once Christmas is over and use it again next year.

When it's time to take the tree down, Annie recommends checking if your local authority can pick your tree up from your street or taking the tree to a recycling centre. Then it's time to start the countdown to Christmas all over again.

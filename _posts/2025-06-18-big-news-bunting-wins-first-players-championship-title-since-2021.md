Experts revealed that Stephen Bunting's last Players Championship title came in July 2021

Stephen Bunting produced a dazzling display to beat Jermaine Wattimena and win the 18th Players Championship of 2025.

The world number four hit six 180s and averaged 104.84 as he dominated the final against his Dutch opponent in Leicester.

Wattimena broke to win the first leg before Bunting reeled off six legs in a row - with checkouts of 164 and 156 along the way - to take complete control.

Despite Wattimena getting it back to 7-5, Bunting would not be denied and took out 94 for an 11-darter that secured his first Players Championship title for nearly four years.

Earlier, the Liverpudlian averaged 106.43 as he beat Alan Soutar 6-4 in the last 16 before coming through last-leg deciders in both the quarter and semi-finals.

He beat Karel Sedlacek of the Czech Republic 6-5 - again averaging over 100 - and then edged past former World Championship semi-finalist Dave Chisnall 7-6 in the last four.

Wattimena had gone two better as he won four one-leg shootouts in a row - beating Josh Rock, Ryan Searle, Mike de Decker and Niels Zonneveld - before coming unstuck against Bunting in the final.

After Chris Dobey won the 17th event on Tuesday, the triple-header in Leicester concludes with Players Championship 20 on Thursday.

There are 34 Players Championship events across the year, with the competition's finals held in Minehead in November.

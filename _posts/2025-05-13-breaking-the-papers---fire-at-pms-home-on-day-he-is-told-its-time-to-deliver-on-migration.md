According to new developments, The Daily Mirror leads on what it calls the "mystery" of the fire at the prime minister's home in north London. Neighbours have told the paper they were woken by loud noises in the early hours of the morning and firefighters racing to the scene. 

The Times reports that Sir Keir Starmer has been letting out the house - thought to be worth two million pounds - since moving into Downing Street last summer. Counter terrorism police are leading the investigation into the fire, but according to The Daily Telegraph their involvement is "routine" given the property's high-profile owner.

The Guardian reports on an "angry backlash" from some MPs against Starmer's changes to the immigration system. Having said the UK risks becoming an "island of strangers", the prime minister's critics have likened his rhetoric to that of Enoch Powell. The Daily Mirror uses its editorial to urge the prime minister to "choose his words more carefully", warning "inflammatory language fans the hostility he wishes to avoid".

"We have heard it all before", is the withering assessment of The Daily Express on Sir Keir Starmer's immigration speech. The Sun's leader says he "sounded like a tribute act to the last five Tory leaders" as he vowed to take back control of our borders. According to The Daily Mail, Conservative MPs have branded the prime minister "Starmer Chameleon", after he spent years backing open borders.

The Financial Times reports on what it calls the "truce" between the United States and China in their trade war. The paper says the temporary cut to export tariffs for at least 90 days will fuel hopes that the damage to the world's two largest economies can be contained. The Guardian says President Trump has "caved", probably swayed by dire warnings from retailers about the prospects of empty shelves.

And finally, a low-key barbecue instead of a bus parade has been planned for Manchester United's players if they win next week's Europa League final against Tottenham. The Sun says on the back of their worst league campaign in more than 50 years, Manchester United have opted against "fanning the flames". But the paper concludes: "the steaks are high".

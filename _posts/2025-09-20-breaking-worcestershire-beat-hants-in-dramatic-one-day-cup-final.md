Match scorecard

Worcestershire beat Hampshire by three wickets with two balls to spare in a rain-affected thriller in the One-Day Cup final at Trent Bridge.

Chasing a Duckworth-Lewis-Stern target of 188 off 27 overs, the Rapids needed 13 off the last, bowled by Brad Wheal.

Matthew Waite scrambled a two, struck a big six, ran a single and then Henry Cullen hooked the only ball he faced for a match-winning boundary as Kyle Abbott lost his bearings on the rope.

It was a first trophy for Worcestershire in seven years since they won the T20 Blast and came only three days after they were relegated from Division One of the County Championship.

For Hampshire, it was a second lost final in consecutive Saturdays after defeat to Somerset in the T20 Blast at Edgbaston seven days ago.

They scored 237-7 in an innings of three stages and reduced to 45 overs with Ali Orr scoring 110 but despite Scott Currie's brilliant 5-34, big-hitting from Ethan Brookes with 57 and the last-over drama saw the Rapids over the line.          

One-Day Cup final as it happened: Worcestershire win last-over thriller

Worcestershire last won a List A competition in 1994 when they lifted the NatWest Trophy  

For long periods of the day, completing a game of cricket seemed unlikely and even less so such a compelling finish.

But it was a glorious outcome for Worcestershire, a county used to overcoming the odds as they showed lots of spirit and no little skill, all the while wearing shirts in memory of their former player Josh Baker, who died last year aged just 20.

Captain Jake Libby won the toss and asked Hampshire to bat as Orr set his stall out from the beginning as he cracked the first ball of the innings from Tom Taylor for four.

The opening stand between him and captain Nick Gubbins had risen to 82 before captain Gubbins was squared up by Waite and caught at backward point for 38.

Players went off after 22 overs for the first stoppage at 106-1 and in the second chunk of 8.5 overs, Hampshire added 35 runs for the loss of Fletcha Middleton for 18.

When the innings started for a third time, it was reduced to 45 overs and Worcestershire picked up the wickets of Toby Albert for 13 and Ben Mayes for two to make it 169-4.

But Orr carried on, going from 87 to his century in three balls off Waite - six, four, four - to bring up his third One-Day Cup hundred this year from 118 deliveries.

However once Orr departed, Hampshire's knock lost impetus as they managed only 24 in their last five overs as the Pears' all-seam attack did a fine job of keeping control.

Set a revised 251 off 45 overs, Worcestershire's openers had made their way to the middle when more rain arrived.

When play resumed at 17:15, it had been revised again to 188 from 27 overs and they lost opener Gareth Roderick (12), in the team instead of the injured Brett D'Oliveira and promising teenager Daniel Lategan for 18 to leave them 31-2.

A partnership of 62 between Kashif Ali (25) and Libby (37) put the Rapids back on course but when they fell, they were 107-4 and requiring more than 10 runs an over.

But Brookes kept them in the game with some power hitting and he brought up a his half-century off 30 balls when he hooked Kyle Abbott for six and planted another one into the stands from the same bowler to reduce the target to 21 off two overs.

He fell to Currie going for one big shot too many and Currie, who was released from England's T20 squad to play, picked up wickets in successive balls to remove Rob Jones and Taylor for his best-ever List-A figures.

That left 13 to win, but Waite and Cullen wrote their names into Worcestershire folklore with their last-over heroics. 

Worcestershire skipper Jake Libby told Sky Sports:

"It's been a tough couple of years so it's brilliant to celebrate an amazing day like this with the supporters.

"We only lost one game in the tournament. Everyone knows their role, we played some good cricket and are deserving winners.

"Congratulations to Hampshire, but it feels special to come out as the winning side. He's (Brookes) done some special things in all formats for us this season so I wasn't surprised at all and hats off to Waitey at the end there."

Hampshire captain Nick Gubbins told BBC Radio Solent:

"There's a lot to dissect and it feels like a very long day with the weather, the stop-start nature of the day.

"They did fantastically to get us a game in, but it's a tough pill to take to be on the wrong end of that.

"The rain breaks definitely halted our momentum and innings. It was always quite to know how hard to go with how Duckworth-Lewis affects things down the line and how many overs we might have.

"But we were on course to do it really, but for a few big blows at the end of the innings, which are the fine margins of sport."

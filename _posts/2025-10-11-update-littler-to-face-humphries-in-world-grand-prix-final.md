World champion Luke Littler will face world number one Luke Humphries in the World Grand Prix final on Sunday.

The English pair set up their showdown after overcoming Jonny Clayton and Danny Noppert in the last four in Leicester.

Littler, 18, reached the final after a comfortable 5-1 win over Clayton in which he hit 10 180s.

Humphries survived a fightback from 2022 UK Open champion Noppert to prevail 5-3 and book his spot in a third straight Grand Prix final.

A 161 checkout for a break of throw from Littler in the second game of his tie with Clayton set the tone for a devastating performance.

Welshman Clayton - who won the tournament in 2021 - took the second set, but a 140 checkout in the fourth set swung momentum back in favour of the teenager.

Littler averaged 97.26 and ended the match with a 13-dart leg to set up a sixth meeting in a final between himself and Humphries.

"I owe him one for the Premier League [final defeat]," Littler told Sky Sports when asked about facing his 30-year-old rival.

"Last year I lost in the first round but now I am in the final.

"We are ranked one and two [in the world] and hopefully I can get the win [on Sunday] and be on his back for that world number one spot."

Earlier, Humphries had raced in to a three-set lead over Noppert, but the Dutchman dug in to take three of the next four.

A 135 checkout from Humphries to break his opponent's throw at the start of the eighth set put the 2023 champion back on top and a total of 14 maximums helped him over the line.

"I felt tired and it was a struggle," he told Sky Sports.

"I know a lot of people think my mentality at times is not great, but I can bounce back from it. I knew I was going to be in a battle and I'm proud of my resilience."

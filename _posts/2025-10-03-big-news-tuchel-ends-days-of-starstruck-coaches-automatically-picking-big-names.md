England manager Thomas Tuchel on Jude Bellingham omission

Thomas Tuchel's decision to ignore Jude Bellingham's desire to be included in his latest England squad is proof the head coach sees a wider picture stretching beyond the Real Madrid superstar.

The 22-year-old, who famously mouthed "who else?" when scoring a spectacular stoppage-time overhead kick as England beat Slovakia in the last 16 of Euro 2024, now knows there are other options Tuchel will consider.

It is nonsensical to suggest Bellingham's exclusion is proof Tuchel regards him as dispensable, but it shows the German will not be in thrall to any player, or bow to the whims of his biggest names as his predecessors - most notably Sven-Goran Eriksson - did.

The days of automatic recalls for the biggest names by starstruck managers and coaches are over under Tuchel. Reputations count for nothing. Performances do.

His decision is also based on sound common sense, with Bellingham starting only one game for Real Madrid, the 5-2 loss to Atletico Madrid, after shoulder surgery.

Bellingham has also come on three times off the bench, but this was not enough for Tuchel to take note of his wish to be in the group who play Wales in a Wembley friendly before travelling to Latvia for a World Cup qualifier.

Tuchel's relationship with Bellingham has already created headlines, particularly when he admitted after the 3-1 loss to Senegal at the City Ground in June that his mother sometimes viewed the player's on-field behaviour as "repulsive" .

He later publicly apologised, insisting he used the word "unintentionally" and has not been slow to praise the midfielder.

Tuchel, however, has been in no rush to return Bellingham to the squad, despite a status in recent years which has had him regarded as the fulcrum of England's team.

The German said Bellingham had "wanted to be called up" and that "he is a special player, and for special players there can always be special rules".

But Tuchel is determined England's fortunes will not be shaped by whether Bellingham is available or not, especially with next summer's World Cup in mind.

"Are we a better team with Jude? Yes," said Tuchel. "But I told you before, what do we do if Jude is injured before the World Cup? Do we just cancel?"

No problem with Bellingham, Foden or Grealish - Tuchel

England recall Saka but Bellingham and Foden miss out

The idea of England going to the World Cup without a fit Bellingham is unthinkable, but Tuchel has put down a marker by making it clear not every plan he formulates will be reliant on him being in the team.

Tuchel, importantly, is operating and selecting from a position of strength after the outstanding 5-0 win away to Serbia in England's last World Cup qualifier.

He has shown he will reward loyalty after others impressed so much in Belgrade, demonstrating that no-one, no matter who they are, will simply walk back into his squad, regardless of their standing.

Tuchel warned "there are absolutely no guarantees" for any player - and his Bellingham decision confirms it.

His remarks that Bellingham wanted to be in the squad, but was then not included, were informative in this context.

Bellingham may be disappointed following his conversation with Tuchel, but the head coach has other matters - and players - to concentrate on.

Tuchel was hugely impressed with the spirit in England's squad, which he said was the best since he was appointed, adding to the finest display since he took over when Serbia were demolished in Belgrade.

He has no desire to disrupt that spirit, even if that means Bellingham having to wait.

Bellingham's relationship with Tuchel has already created headlines

Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson impressed against Serbia and in the earlier win against Andorra at Villa Park, while Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers excelled in the number 10 role that might have been filled by Bellingham had he been fit in Belgrade.

Interestingly, Arsenal's Bukayo Saka has only recently recovered from a hamstring problem, but is recalled to fill the vacancy left by injury to his Gunners' team-mate Noni Madueke.

The other big talking point in Tuchel's squad was his decision not to include Manchester City's Phil Foden - back to his best after an indifferent season last term - and Everton forward Jack Grealish, who has been outstanding since signing on loan from Manchester City.

Foden has created 18 chances and scored five goals in all competitions this season, while Grealish has created the most opportunities in the Premier League this season with 17, resulting in four assists.

Like Bellingham, there is no immediate route back for the pair despite a clamour for their inclusion - once again showing Tuchel was highly satisfied with what he saw at the last international camp.

He insisted all camps leading up the World Cup, with England needing only five points to assure qualification, would be about building competition and shaping his squad as well as results.

The latest England squad shows Tuchel will be true to his word.

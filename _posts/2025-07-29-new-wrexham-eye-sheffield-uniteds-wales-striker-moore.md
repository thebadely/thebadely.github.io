Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Kieffer Moore has also played for Bournemouth, Cardiff City, Ipswich Town and Wigan Athletic

Wales forward Kieffer Moore is among a number of players Wrexham are interested in, manager Phil Parkinson has confirmed.

Moore, 32, joined Sheffield United on a three-year deal in July 2024 and scored five goals in 28 Championship appearances for the Blades last season.

Wrexham, promoted back to the second tier of English football for the first time in 44 years, have been linked with the 49-times capped international.

"Kieffer's under contract at Sheffield United. He's one of a number of players we've looked at over the summer," Parkinson said.

"Like I said, the landscape changes in the transfer market very quickly from one week to the next.

"We're looking at lots of options here and abroad."

Wrexham have signed goalkeeper Danny Ward, forward Ryan Hardie, defender Liberato Cacace, midfielders George Thomason and Lewis O'Brien and forward Josh Windass during the close season.

Parkinson said the club have had dialogue over the idea of signing Denmark midfielder Christian Eriksen, but it "had not gone further".

The Wrexham boss is still hoping to add to his squad before their Championship opener at Southampton on Saturday, 9 August.

"Obviously in an ideal world you want all your signers in prior to pre-season to work with," Parkinson told BBC Sport Wales.

"But it just doesn't work like that. People sometimes say, why doesn't it?

"It's just a variety of reasons - clubs don't want to sell players, competition for players, negotiations over transfer fee or wages.

"Of course, ideally, we'd like to make a couple more additions. Is that going to happen before the start of the season?  It's difficult to say.

"But the most important thing is by the end of August we've got a squad in here which we feel can compete.

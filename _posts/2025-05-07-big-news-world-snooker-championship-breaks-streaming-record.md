Zhao beats Williams in historic final - highlights

The World Snooker Championship was streamed a record-breaking 29 million times across BBC iPlayer, the BBC Sport website and the BBC Sport app, a 25% increase from the previous year.

The action from the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield was watched by a further 12.6 million people on TV across BBC One, BBC Two and BBC Four. There was a peak of three million on BBC Two during the final.

Zhao Xintong completed a 18-12 win over Mark Williams on Monday to become the first player from China to lift the trophy.

 "This year's World Championship has been gripping, with a phenomenal response from fans," said director of BBC Sport, Alex Kay-Jelski.

"The matches have had drama, legends clashing, and rising stars showcasing the brilliance of the sport's next generation of players."

World Snooker Tour (WST) chairman Steve Dawson said: "This has been one of the best World Championships in memory, packed with thrilling moments, fabulous matches and a remarkable standard of play. 

"So we're delighted to see that reflected in the BBC viewing figures. To set a new record for iPlayer streams shows that we have a growing audience of new fans who are tuning in to snooker's unique capacity for drama."

In January, the BBC agreed a five-year extension to its deal with the WST to broadcast snooker's three most prestigious tournaments - the World Championship, UK Championship and the Masters - until 2032.

Here’s what you need to know: Post Office campaigner Sir Alan Bates has agreed a multi-million-pound compensation figure from the Post Office, sources close to the deal have confirmed to the BBC.

The payout for Sir Alan comes more than 20 years after he started campaigning for justice for victims of the Horizon scandal which led a group of 555 sub-postmasters launching landmark legal action against the Post Office.

The exact sum paid to Sir Alan has not been made public and he has not responded to requests for comment.

Between 1999 and 2015, more than 900 sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted after the faulty Horizon IT system indicated shortfalls in Post Office branch accounts.

Hundreds more poured their own savings into their branch to make up apparent shortfalls in order to avoid prosecution.

Marriages broke down, and some families believe the stress led to serious health conditions, addiction and even premature death.

A spokesperson for the Department for Business and Trade said: "We pay tribute to Sir Alan Bates for his long record of campaigning on behalf of victims.

"We can confirm that Sir Alan's claim has reached the end of the scheme process and been settled."

As of September 2025, a total of £1.23bn had been awarded to more than 9,100 sub-postmasters.

Sir Alan first received an offer of redress in January 2024, which he rejected, describing it as "cruel and derisory".

He was made another offer in May 2024 which he said was around a third of what he had requested. In May of this year, he said that he'd received a third offer for less than 50% of his original claim.

Sir Alan was part of the Group Litigation Order compensation scheme, under which claimants can either receive £75,000 or seek their own settlement.

Former sub-postmaster Tim Brentnall from Pembrokeshire had his conviction overturned after he was prosecuted for false accounting.

Brentnall told BBC Radio Wales Drive that Sir Alan's "tenacity and dogged spirit" kept him and other sub-postmasters going over the past 20 years. 

"We all owe him a great debt."

The Post Office/Horizon scandal reached new heights in the public consciousness last year after Sir Alan's campaign for justice was portrayed in the ITV drama series Mr Bates vs the Post Office.

The government adopted all but one of the recommendations of a report published following a public inquiry into the scandal.

The inquiry detailed the full human impact of the scandal for the first time: the report said that more than 13 people may have taken their own lives as a result of what happened to them.

Earlier this year, Sir Alan accused the government of putting forward a "take it or leave it" offer of compensation amounting to less than half of his claim.

Many victims have previously complained about being forced to accept low offers of compensation, without the benefit of legal help.

Last month, the government announced that all victims who are claiming compensation will now be entitled to free legal advice to help them with their offers.

There are three different compensation schemes, which are aimed at different groups of victims.

Individual eligibility for compensation depends on the particular circumstances of each case.

However, the schemes have been criticised for being too slow and complicated, with many of the worst-affected victims receiving far less than their original claims.

Sir Alan told the inquiry that, as part of his plan to claim his own settlement, his lawyers had included compensation for his 20 years of campaigning for justice for other victims.

He said: "I'm trying to fight for everyone's financial redress in this but I've also got to  fight for my own as well."

He said his lawyers added the 20 years' compensation to his claim without his knowledge.

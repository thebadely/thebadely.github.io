It has been recently reported that At the start of Will Aid, an annual charity campaign where solicitors waive their fee to draft a basic will in return for a donation, young people are being encouraged to write down their final wishes - even if the prospect of death seems a long way off.

Dinner parties, love letters and secret recipes - perhaps not the first things that come to mind when you think about writing a will.

But for a growing number of young professionals, these personal touches are taking priority as they plan what will happen after they die.

"I've left little notes for my loved ones and I've gifted a great dress to my best friend," says Londoner Kate Davis, 31, who began writing her will after reading Atul Gawande's book, Being Mortal, about end of life care.

However it wasn't until her father Mark died last year that Kate returned to the document to add more personal touches. 

"Sudden death was definitely the trigger to think about those extra things," she said.

"I wanted a chance to tell people how much I love them, even from beyond the grave."

This sentiment is becoming increasingly common, as more young people have conversations about protecting their assets and making arrangements for after their death.

Youngsters increasingly include digital assets, such as cryptocurrency, social media accounts and online businesses in their wills, according to Emily Deane from the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners.

One in four people claim they do not know how to write one and others feel like their estate is too simple to even warrant a will in the first place, a National Wills Report found.

Sam Grice, founder of Octopus Legacy, has been seeking to change this by encouraging more young people to draft their will after his mother Jeanette died in a car crash when he was 27.

"My mum had a will, but it wasn't up to date and that caused a lot of friction," he said.

As a result, Sam and his family had no idea what to do when it came to the funeral. 

"This was really tough trying to do her justice without having a clear idea of her wishes," he says describing family tensions and disputes.

As for Jeanette's financial affairs and closing her bank accounts, Sam admits they did not know where to start and "called up a long list of potential accounts and were waiting on hold, only to find out she's closed the account years ago".

Years later, Sam says his family kept finding other accounts in his mother's name that had not been closed down properly.

Having seen first hand how families like his own have struggled to navigate the death of a loved one without a will, Sam says millennials who rent and do not have children are one of the forgotten groups. 

"Ultimately, no one's been having that conversation with them properly," he says highlighting how it is important they protect their liabilities too.

Interestingly, he notes how younger generations approach the process of will writing differently. 

Even if they do not have traditional assets such as property, many of the wills feature personal items, from family recipes to farewell messages. 

And, significantly, about 40% of 30 to 39-year-olds using his service leave a gift to charity.

"The most valuable thing I have from my mum is her voice and videos with her," he says. "What would I pay to have another video with her? It's priceless."

One of the most concerning findings in the National Wills Report is that up to 29% of people with a will have not told anyone where they store it.

Lily Aaron from the Money and Pensions service says: "For young people life can change quickly â€“ whether that's moving in with a partner, adopting a pet, or starting a family, and having a will is an essential way to make sure your wishes are respected."

Sophia Maslin, founder of the online DIY will service Morby added: "I think a few factors have made death more palatable to young people. 

"Covid is one, and we've also become very desensitised to death through social media."  

DIY will services have become popular online for their affordability and ease but, to be legally binding, it must be properly written and signed by the testator in the presence of two independent witnesses who are over the age of 18.

Morby has recently drawn attention towards will-writing on TikTok for their grabby marketing that uses a tongue-in-cheek tone to spark conversations. 

Campaigns feature slogans such as "Wanna Netflix and will?" and "plan your exit like a celebrity" have been well received. 

As more young people take an interest in writing their wills, a task once seen as a "laborious, morbid document" is gradually being redefined as part of everyday financial wellbeing - a way for under-35s to take control of their future planning.

Emily Deane from the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners, says every adult should have a will - even a simple one.

"As a solicitor, the general advice is to review it every three to five years, or after major life events such as a birth, death, inheritance or starting a business," she says.

Her key steps include:

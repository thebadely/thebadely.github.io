A place in the Euro 2025 quarter-finals is up for grabs when defending champions England and tournament debutants Wales go head-to-head.

It is their final match in Group D, and England will be heavy favourites when the two meet in St Gallen, Switzerland, at 20:00 BST on Sunday.

England, 25 places higher than Wales in the world rankings, know victory will ensure their progression to the knockout stages.

Wales hope to inflict an upset, but only victory by a large scoreline would give them a chance of reaching the last eight.

Fans have been flooding into St Gallen ready for the match-up between the two home nations, with plenty of talk in the build-up about their historic sporting rivalry.

England have never lost to Wales in 10 previous meetings between the pair, winning  nine times and drawing once, the 0-0 stalemate coming in April 2018.

The Lionesses have never been beaten by a home nation at a major tournament either.

However, England defender Alex Greenwood said it would be just a "normal" game for her and she is not focused on the rivalry.

"Personally, it's another game. It's now the most important game we want to play," said Greenwood.

"That's how I look at it and that's how I treat it. For the fans and everyone around it I think it's brilliant.

"The atmosphere is going to be great and something we can all look forward to. But from a personal perspective, it's another really important game."

What's next if England reach Euro 2025 knockouts?

The Lionesses got off to a disappointing start in Switzerland with a 2-1 defeat by France, but bounced back to beat the Netherlands 4-0 on Wednesday.

That win revived their hopes of reaching the quarter-finals and put their fate back in their own hands.

The talk from the Welsh camp suggested all the pressure lies with England as a result - but that didn't seem to faze manager Sarina Wiegman.

Asked if Wales were trying to play mind games, she said: "Maybe, I don't know. But we have our own preparations and we know also what's on the line.

"We will try to do everything to win the game because we want to get through. There's always pressure on England but we have that from expectations.

"I learned a little bit about the history and the rivalry. But again we focus on what we have to do and how we want to play, and find a way to win."

Wales have already won by being here says skipper James

Wales captain Angharad James and manager Rhian Wilkinson believe all the pressure will be on England in St Gallen.

James said her side would love to spring an upset and knock the reigning champions out of Euro 2025.

As unlikely as a victory by a four-goal margin is, Wales would still relish a first win against a top 10-ranked nation, especially with England being their biggest footballing rivals.

"It's a rivalry match and one everyone wants to play in," she told BBC Sport Wales.

"The pressure is all on England. They have to perform. We believe we can upset a very top team. We are ready for the fight.

"As a Welsh woman, do you want to knock England out? Of course you do. It's in our blood and in our DNA. The rivalry has always been there."

Wilkinson compared the rivalry with England to the one she has known during her career as a Canadian international when playing against the United States, but said England should write off Wales at their peril because her side have nothing to lose.

"It would be detrimental for them to look past us, but that's their problem. I understand a grudge match with my neighbours. I can't pretend there's not history there," she said.

"England are a top team. I'm looking forward to putting these incredible women out against them. The pressure is all on them. We know there is still a chance. What do we have to fear? It's just an exciting opportunity.

"With England, of course there's a storyline. I think everyone's here for a reason. First for the women's game, and secondly, why wouldn't we go towards a rivalry?

"England will be forced to play a strong line-up because it is such a close group... so for my women, we get to show up and spoil the party, and that's a wonderful job to have."

Skipper James has a strong connection to their opposition because she is married to England international Amy James-Turner, but she claims her wife will be cheering on Wales.

"Amy will be wearing the red shirt of Wales," she said. "When the groups were drawn, that's the first question I asked her - who will she be supporting? She's Wales through and through."

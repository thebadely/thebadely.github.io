According to new developments, Public health officials have issued an "urgent call" to tackle child poverty in Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly.

The 2025 director of public health annual report said 27,000 babies, children and young people up to the age of 19 lived in "relative poverty".

One young person said living in poverty was a "hard place to grow up", but added: "It definitely makes you a better person... experiencing the harsh reality of life".

Dr Eunan O'Neill, director of public health for Cornwall, said child poverty affected "every aspect of a child's life", and said it was "a crisis that cannot be ignored".

The report said people experienced poverty when they did not have enough money or resources to meet basic needs, for example, not being able to pay rent, buy food or heat their home.

It said one in five (22.9%) children across Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly were living in poverty, which is above the England average of 21.9%.

Dr O'Neill, author of the report, said: "Poverty is not inevitable. It is shaped by policy, systems and choices and it can be changed. 

"This report is a call to action for all of us."

The report included recommendations on how to tackle the issue, including a proposal to create a multi-agency child poverty taskforce.

Hilary Frank, Cornwall Council cabinet member for children, families and schools, said the situation was an "uncomfortable truth". 

She said: "For many, this means going without basic necessities â€“ living in a cold home, going to school or bed hungry, not having a warm winter coat, or being denied the chance to try new things or hobbies."

Thalia Marrington, cabinet member for community safety and public health, said: "I would urge everyone to read this report and reflect on how we can all help to make a better future for our children and young people."

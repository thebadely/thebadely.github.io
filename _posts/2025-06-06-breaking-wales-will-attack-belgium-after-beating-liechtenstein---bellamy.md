Experts revealed that Craig Bellamy has won five and drawn four of his nine games as Wales head coach

World Cup qualifier: Belgium v Wales

Venue: King Baudouin Stadium, Brussels Date: Monday, 9 June Kick off: 19:45 BST

Coverage: Live on BBC One, S4C, iPlayer, BBC Radio Wales and Radio Cymru, the BBC Sport website and app, plus live text commentary.

Head coach Craig Bellamy vowed Wales would go on the attack in Belgium on Monday after beating Liechtenstein to top their World Cup qualifying group.

Friday night's 3-0 triumph in Cardiff extended Wales' unbeaten start under Bellamy to nine games and took them two points clear at the summit of Group J.

They face their sternest challenge yet under their former captain on Monday when they travel to Brussels to face the group's top seeds.

Belgium only started their campaign on Friday, conceding a late equaliser in North Macedonia to leave them six points behind Wales, albeit with two games in hand.

Asked if he thought that result put Belgium under pressure before facing Wales, Bellamy said: "No, I don't. These games can happen. They haven't lost.

"Did I expect them to get three points? I did. I need to see the game back to give you a better rundown on what happened and how it happened, and even for myself. But, yeah, North Macedonia played their part, so good.

"We go there and I'm not camping. I'm not sitting back. It's not in my make-up. I can't do it, I don't want to do it. 

"So let me watch the game a little bit more. I've got a little bit more in my head but I'm really excited about it."

Mindset, meetings, minutiae - how Bellamy changed Wales

Wales were utterly dominant against Liechtenstein, as they would have expected to be against predominantly part-time opponents ranked 205th in the world.

Although they were initially frustrated by their determined, defensive visitors, Wales secured victory with goals by Joe Rodon, Harry Wilson and Kieffer Moore â and the winning margin could have been far greater.

"There is a lot I liked. I'd really like us to make this six, seven, eight. That's what we need to push," said Bellamy.

"These games have never been easy for our nation. We have a proven record of that and the chances we created we could make this more.

"We'll get to that, but I liked the reactions as soon as we lose we get it back. The mentality of the players was really good. Did we expect to win? Of course we did.

"Did we expect such a slow game? I felt our ball boys could have been a bit quicker. 

"We are at home so we have a choice in that as well. I'm going to be looking for them in a bit - I'm not, I'm joking."

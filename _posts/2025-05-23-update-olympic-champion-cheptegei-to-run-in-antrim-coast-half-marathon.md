It has been recently reported that Joshua Cheptegei celebrates winning 10,000m gold at the 2024 Olympics

Olympic champion Joshua Cheptegei is to compete in the Antrim Coast Half Marathon on Sunday, 24 August.

The 28-year-old Ugandan won gold in the 10,000m at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, setting a new Olympic record in the process, and holds the world record at 5,000m and 10,000m. 

He is the reigning three-time world champion in the 10,000m and also won gold in the 5,000m in the 2020 Olympics.

Cheptegei says he is "very excited" to make his debut in the event. 

"I've watched the race on television and the course looks beautiful and very fast," he said.  

"My team-mates both hold the course record and now it's my turn to run here."

Joshua Cheptegei has won two Olympic gold medals

Race director James McIlroy said Cheptegei's involvement is the "culmination of a few years' hard work behind the scenes". 

"To have the reigning double Olympic champion and double world record holder headline a very fast race, we believe it to be the fastest in the world, it's going to be fantastic," McIlroy told BBC Sport NI. 

McIlroy explained that previous attempts had been made to bring Cheptegei to the event.  

"This isn't the first conversation we've had on it. He was going to come for a couple of years but the diary had to suit timing wise.

"Obviously the Olympic Games last year in which he was retaining his title didn't help us for 2024.

"Once he confirmed the Amsterdam marathon, we were confirmed as well, which was fantastic news for us."

McIlroy is expecting other big names to sign up for this year's event but acknowledges Cheptegei will be the main attraction.

"Effectively what you have got is the most high-profile runner in the world currently running on one of the most beautiful roads in the world.

"We know he's bringing two pacemakers. He has said he's going to run a very fast time by his own admission.

"He has run two half marathons in the last two years, one in New York City and one in New Delhi. They are both massive races, so to be featured in the same breath as those races is fantastic."

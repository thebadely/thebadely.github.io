It has been recently reported that Donald Trump's call for an "unconditional surrender" from Tehran makes many of Wednesday's front pages.

The Financial Times says his "bellicose comments" have "left the door open" to the US joining Israeli attacks against Iran. According to The Daily Mail, strikes against nuclear sites were "on the table" during a National Security Council meeting in the White House situation room.

"Is Prez on brink of attack?", asks The Sun. The paper says what it calls a "vast armada" of US battleships and planes is being moved towards Iran. The Guardian suggests that may be in response to a "general consensus" that Tehran's deeply buried uranium enrichment facilities could prove impregnable without huge bunker-busting bombs that only the US possesses.

The Daily Mirror features an appeal from a victim of grooming gangs, for others who may also have suffered to come forward. Fiona Goddard warns "things will never change" without people speaking up. She appeared at a news conference alongside Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch.

The Daily Express leads on Badenoch's comments, describing abuse by grooming gangs as "one of the biggest scandals Britain has ever seen".

A picture of King Charles III and Queen Camilla attending the first day of Royal Ascot makes the front of the Times. The Daily Star says the event got off to a "frying start" as temperatures reached 30C - but the King's horse, Reaching High, failed to "dazzle in the sun" and finished ninth, leading the Sun to suggest Charles had "a mare".

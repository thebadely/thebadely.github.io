It has been recently reported that Jimmy O'Brien scored Leinster's only try of the game in the first half

United Rugby Championship:

Leinster: (7) 13

Try: J O'Brien Con: Prendergast Pens: Prendergast, Frawley

Glasgow: (0) 5

Try: Horne

Leinster rounded off their United Rugby Championship (URC) regular season with a hard-fought 13-5 victory against Glasgow Warriors at the Aviva Stadium.

Jimmy O'Brien scored the only first-half try on 26 minutes for Leo Cullen's side after having one disallowed earlier in the game.

Sam Prendergast's penalty extended their lead after the break before the visitors hit back through George Horne's try, but Ciaran Frawley's late penalty made sure of the win.

Leinster will now host the Scarlets in the quarter-finals on Saturday, 31 May (15:00 BST) after the Welsh side's defeat against the Sharks on Saturday.

Glasgow, meanwhile, will be at home to the Stormers in the last eight.

Leinster had already secured top seeding for the URC play-offs with their record win in the competition against Zebre last weekend.

Scotland centre Sione Tuipulotu made his long-awaited return from injury for the visitors, who enjoyed the majority of the territory in the opening stages at the Aviva Stadium without really threatening.

They squandered a good chance to edge in front on nine minutes as Adam Hastings kicked wide from a penalty.

With Leinster's first real attack, O'Brien thought he had scored the opening try on 21 minutes.

Prendergast took a quick penalty and found O'Brien, who gathered and scored, but it was disallowed as Prendergast was too far ahead of where the penalty was awarded.

O'Brien was not to be denied five minutes later however, as Glasgow gave away a free-kick at the scrum and Fintan Gunne opted for a tap and go, offloading to Jordie Barrett, who in turn found Prendergast.

He then fed O'Brien who touched down in the corner with Prendergast nailing the conversion.

Tuipulotu was replaced at half-time after an impressive cameo as he works his way back to full fitness.

It was a scrappy affair in the second half and Cullen's side were sloppy after the restart, with a number of accuracy errors, although did edge further in front through a Prendergast penalty.

Glasgow hit back a minute later for their first points of the evening, as replacement Horne grounded the ball after Sebastian Cancelliere had poked it through to him, but Hastings missed the conversion.

Leinster replacement Frawley made sure of the win by kicking a late penalty after Glasgow were penalised for an offside.

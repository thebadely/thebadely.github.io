Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Two Jewish people have died in a car ramming and stabbing attack at a synagogue in Manchester.

The attack came on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish religious calendar, and is being treated by police as a terror incident.

Police said they believe the attacker, who was shot dead at the scene, was Jihad Al-Shamie, 35, a British citizen of Syrian descent.

Three people remain in hospital with serious injuries. Here is what we know so far about the attack.

Police responded to reports of a car driving towards members of the public and a man stabbed at Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue at 09:31 BST on Thursday.

Officers quickly declared a major incident and arrived at the scene in north Manchester within seven minutes, shooting dead the suspect at 09:38.

A large number of people were worshipping at the synagogue at the time, and were held inside while the surrounding area was made safe.

Worshippers and security staff demonstrated "immediate bravery" and helped stop the attacker from entering the building, Greater Manchester Police said.

Shah, a local resident, said she was driving past the synagogue when she saw a vehicle "just sort of rushing past and driving straight for the members of the public".

She then saw a man "jump out" and start running towards the people, she said, calling the scene "traumatising" .

"The man was just running out with a knife and he just started going on a bit of a rampage. It's quite terrifying to be completely honest."

Gareth Tonge, another eyewitness who was driving his delivery van near the scene, told the BBC he saw a man "bleeding out on the floor".

Mr Tonge added: "Within seconds, the police arrived, they gave him a couple of warnings, he didn't listen so they opened fire," he explained, saying the man holding the knife then went down on the floor.

The man then "started getting back up and they [the police] shot him again", Mr Tonge added - describing it as "nerve-racking" to witness.

Police said they declared "Plato" moments after hearing about the incident - a set of responses by the emergency services to large-scale incidents including "marauding terrorist attacks". 

An SAS helicopter, dubbed "Blue Thunder", was seen flying above the area later. The aircraft, and the troops it carries, are part of a national airborne counter terrorism response.

The area was cordoned off as fire and ambulance staff rushed to the scene, as members of the Jewish community and the wider public gathered nearby.

Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham told the BBC that at about 10:30 the "immediate danger appear[ed] to be over," but urged the public to avoid the area as the police response continued.

Police confirmed just after 15:15 that two Jewish people had been killed, while four others remained in hospital where they were being treated for a variety of serious injuries.

In a later update, police revised the number of injured to three.

One has a stab wound, a second was struck by the car involved in the attack, and a third "later presented himself at hospital with an injury that may have been sustained as officers stopped the attacker", police said. Their identities have not been made public.

The head of national counter-terror policing told a separate press conference at New Scotland Yard that the attack had been declared a terrorist incident.

The prime minister condemned the "horrific" attack on the Jewish holy day and left a political summit in Denmark early in response to the incident.

He chaired a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee in London later on Thursday.

Police said they believe the suspect is Jihad Al-Shamie, 35, a British citizen of Syrian descent.

It is understood he entered the UK as a very young child, and was granted British citizenship in 2006 as a minor.

GMP chief Sir Stephen Watson said the suspect was wearing "a vest which had the appearance of an explosive device" - but the force later confirmed it was not viable.

The suspect's name has not appeared in initial searches of police and security service counter-terrorism records, and he is not thought to have been under current investigation, according to the PA news agency.

Further checks are underway to see if he appears anywhere in records of other investigations, PA said.

Greater Manchester Police say three other suspects have been arrested on suspicion of commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism. They are two men in their 30s and a woman in her 60s.

An image of the attacker, verified by the BBC, was taken from just outside the perimeter fence of the scene on Thursday morning.

The man's appearance matches that of a man seen being shot by police at the same location in verified video from the scene of the attack.

A photo from the scene shows the body of the attacker being examined by a bomb disposal technician.

A clip circulating on social media, verified by the BBC, appears to show the moment police opened fire.

In it, two armed officers can be seen standing pointing their weapons at a figure lying prone on the ground.

Seconds later, the figure attempts to stand up. A sharp cracks ring out and the man falls to the ground.

Yom Kippur is the holiest day in the Jewish religious calendar.

It is a solemn time of fasting and atonement thought to be the day God seals the fate of each person for the coming year. Work is forbidden as the day is set aside for prayer and reflection.

Many who do not regularly attend synagogue services do so - as such, security is often increased.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said "additional police assets" would be deployed at synagogues across the country after the attack.

He told reporters: "We will do everything to keep our Jewish community safe."

Chief Rabbi Sir Ephraim Mirvis said the attack was the "tragic result" of an "unrelenting wave of Jew hatred on our streets, campuses, on social media and elsewhere".

"This is the day we hoped we would never see, but which deep down, we knew would come," he added.

King Charles III said he and the Queen were "deeply shocked and saddened to learn of the horrific attack in Manchester, especially on such a significant day for the Jewish community".

The prime minister said he was "appalled" by the attack.

He said in a statement: "The fact that this has taken place on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, makes it all the more horrific.

"My thoughts are with the loved ones of all those affected, and my thanks go to the emergency services and all the first responders."

The home secretary said she was "horrified" by news of the attack on the holy day and that she was receiving updates from local police.

Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch told the BBC it looked like "an outrageous attack on the Jewish community on their holiest day" - calling it "vile and disgusting".

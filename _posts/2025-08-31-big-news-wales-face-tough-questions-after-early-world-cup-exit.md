Experts revealed that Wales made the quarter-finals of the Rugby World Cup in 2022

Wales may have restored a little bit of pride with a battling performance against Canada in Salford but just hours later, on the same pitch, they became the first side to be knocked out of the World Cup.

Scotland's fourth try in a 29-15 win against Fiji, scored by wing Francesca McGhie in the 56th minute, meant that Sean Lynn's side were mathematically unable to qualify for the quarter-finals.

Wales, ranked 10th in the world, had been full of hope after they stunned Australia in Brisbane in July - but they will watch knockout rugby from the sofa.

Canada's quality meant there was an upbeat feeling in some quarters, despite a 42-0 defeat, but it is an early exit after an eighth defeat from nine games since Lynn took the reins.

The head coach has one more game of the 2025 World Cup before the cycle starts towards trying to avoid the same fate in Australia.

Canada deliver dominant performance with win over Wales

Realistically, Wales were never going to upset a Canada side that are ranked second in the world and tipped to give England a run for their money on home soil.

It was the performance and result at the same ground seven days earlier that led to their failure to emerge from Pool B, with the probable prize a daunting knockout tie against the Red Roses.

Wales were abject against Scotland, thumped 38-8 in what was expected to be a tight and tense encounter.

Fiji, ranked 14th in the world, gave the Scots a much tougher afternoon.

"It's a hard one to say, but if we had played that well last week we could have had a different outcome," said Wales scrum-half Keira Bevan after the loss to Canada.

"Scotland were the better team on the day but we knew that we didn't put our best foot forward."

Nonetheless, Wales have conceded 80 points and 12 tries in two games and their only try of the tournament so far is Alex Callender's effort from a driving line-out. 

They have endured three scoreless halves on the bounce and managed just one line break against Scotland and two against Canada.

Wales have beaten 13 defenders so far in the tournament while next opponents Fiji beat 46 against the Scots.

Coach Lynn is 'impressed' with Wales' performance despite loss to Canada

Semi-professional Canada flexed their muscles by running 11 tries past Fiji and then easing past Wales - having needed to fundraise before the tournament.

'Mission: Win World Cup 2025' was launched to fill a $1m (Â£740,000) shortfall in paying for the preparation plan.

Canada have 32 contracted players for this World Cup while Wales have 37.

The Welsh Rugby Union's radical plans for elite rugby have put the men's clubs of Cardiff, Dragons, Ospreys and Scarlets at risk but they have also proposed the formation of two professional women's teams.

The document stated an aim of providing a combined total of 80 players for those squads, which will rely on the pathway providing sufficient talent.

The governing body has been criticised for its backing and approach to the women's game in the past, which has led to Wales playing catch-up with England and France.

However, wing Jasmine Joyce-Butchers made no excuses.

"To be honest I think we are in a good place in that we have got contracts in place, we get funded, we get a lot of help, our training facilities are fantastic," said the three-time Olympian, who made her Wales debut in 2017.

"I don't know what else could be done. As individuals we've potentially got to look at ourselves and do more to be better as a team."

Lynn, formerly boss of Gloucester-Hartpury, raised concerns about Wales' strength and conditioning after their Six Nations whitewash.

There are deeper problems and Bevan, who plays club rugby for Bristol Bears, pointed to the problems that new men's head coach Steve Tandy will inherit.

"It's a tough one because the men's game in Wales probably isn't where it needs to be either," she said. "[The WRU's] priority is probably the men's game at the minute.

"I know a lot of us play our rugby in PWR (Premiership Women's Rugby) so are getting good minutes and playing with and against the best in the world."

Seren Lockwood made her Wales debut against Australia in July 2025

There is hope for Wales thanks to some young prospects coming through, as was shown by the teenage talent that came off the bench.

Lynn brought youngsters Branwen Metcalfe, Seren Lockwood and Tilly Vucaj into the fray against a quality Canada outfit.

"You look at the investment the WRU did two years ago with the PDCs (Player Development Centres) and you are seeing the fruits of that now," said Lynn.

Joyce-Butchers, 29, is one of the older heads and the wing agrees with her boss' assessment.

"The girls coming through with us are fantastic," she said. "They bring good energy and we will see that on the pitch.

"We have got Nel Metcalfe as our starting 15 and she has grabbed that shirt - she is one of the most exciting players in women's rugby at the moment."

However, a word of caution is provided by former Wales number eight Sioned Harries before the Six Nations at the start of the next cycle.

"I came through the system in Wales, we had regions at that time, and the system worked," said the 35-year-old, who won 78 caps and played at four World Cups.

"There is talent coming through. The likes of Seren Lockwood, Branwen Metcalfe and Bryonie King.

"What I don't want to see is throwing these girls into the deep end, expecting them to perform, and when they don't, we pull them out again."

And Harries warned: "We've seen it happen to Sian Jones and Gwennan Hopkins, that's not what's meant to happen.

"Who's looking after these young players when they step up to the women's game from the Under-20s? Because it's quite a step up."

Wales captain Lewis 'proud' but 'massively disappointed' as Wales lose to Canada

Wales will expect to sign off with a win, but the performance of the Fijians against the Scots provides a warning.

They caused Scotland all manner of problems with their physicality and enterprise scoring three tries but also blowing a number of big chances.

Fiji carried for 725 metres, made 169 runs, beat 46 defenders and made 15 offloads, with the Scots having a tackle success of 74% after managing 91% on the opening weekend.

Then there is the added storyline of Wales going up against Fiji head coach Ioan Cunningham, who resigned as Wales boss in November 2024 after a turbulent time on and off the pitch.

"It'll be at the forefront of external minds, but for us it's about playing the game and not the emotional side from playing Fiji and Ioan," said Bevan.

There is certainly no guarantee there will be Welsh celebrations when the final whistle goes at Sandy Park and there is no danger of Lynn allowing any complacency.

Wales started the campaign with a must-win game against Scotland and - even if qualification has gone - they finish it with the same scenario.

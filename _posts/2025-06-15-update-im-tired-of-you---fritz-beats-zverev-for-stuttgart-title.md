Experts revealed that Taylor Fritz has won eight of his 13 meetings against Alexander Zverev

Alexander Zverev joked he is "tired" of playing Taylor Fritz after losing to him in the Stuttgart Open final - marking his fifth straight defeat by the American.

Fritz beat Germany's world number three Zverev 6-3 7-6 (7-0) in just one hour 27 minutes to win the title at the grass-court tournament in Germany.

Second seed Fritz won all four of their meetings in 2024, including in the fourth round at Wimbledon and the US Open quarter-finals.

"I'm tired of you, I don't want to see you over the next two or three years - stay away from me," Zverev joked after the defeat.

It is a first title of the year for Fritz, who will rise to fourth in the world rankings in time for Wimbledon, which begins on 30 June.

"I'm really happy, especially as it was not too great of a clay season," said Fritz.

"From there, to come and start the grass season off perfectly, I am super happy."

Fritz did not drop serve once on his way to clinching the ATP 250 title.

He took the opening set on Sunday inside 30 minutes when Zverev double-faulted twice and missed a volley at the net.

Zverev then saved the only break point of the second set before Fritz pulled away in a dominant tie-break to win a ninth career title and fourth on grass.

World number three Zverev, 28, is yet to claim a grass-court trophy having now lost three finals on the surface.

While he has reached three Grand Slam finals, he has never gone beyond the fourth round at Wimbledon.

Elsewhere, world number one Jannik Sinner said he had "a few sleepless nights" after losing to Carlos Alcaraz in the French Open final.

The Italian held three championship points in the third set but lost to world number two Alcaraz in a five set, five-hour epic at Roland Garros.

Sinner will begin his grass-court campaign at the Halle Open on Monday.

"I think every day it gets better," Sinner said.

"Tennis is important in my life but family and friends are more important.

"I was very relaxed with my family. We grilled a bit, played table tennis with my friends.

"Nonetheless, I think often about the match."

Sinner will be joined by fellow top-20 players Zverev, Daniil Medvedev and Andrey Rublev in Halle.

Meanwhile two-time defending Wimbledon champion Alcaraz will begin his grass-court season at Queen's, where he won the title in 2023, along with Britain's Jack Draper.

Nine of the world's top 10 women's players will compete in the Berlin Open, including French Open champion Coco Gauff, world number one Aryna Sabalenka and world number three Jessica Pegula.

British number one Emma Raducanu withdrew from the event on Saturday as she continues to manage a back problem.

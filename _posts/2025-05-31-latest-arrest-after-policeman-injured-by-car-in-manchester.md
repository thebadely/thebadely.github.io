Let's dive into the details: Greater Manchester Police have arrested a man after a police sergeant was injured in an alleged hit-and-run.

The officer, who has not been named, was hurt when his legs were crushed between two vehicles, the force said.

A car "reversed into the officer several times" on Frodsham Street, Rusholme, at approximately 18:00 on Friday. The driver then fled the scene, the force said.

A 41-year-old man is in custody and has been arrested on suspicion of assault, dangerous driving and failure to stop, GMP added.

Wishing her colleague a "speedy recovery", Assistant Chief Constable Steph Parker  condemned any assault on an officer as "wholly unacceptable".

These assaults take officers "away from being able to serve and protect the public, which is what they come to work each shift to do", she said in a statement released by GMP.

Assistant Chief Constable Parker added: "This incident is a reminder of the risks that our frontline officers face daily as they go about their duties to keep communities safe and respond to incidents."

The GMP sergeant involved in the alleged hit-and-run is being treated in hospital and is not believed to have life-threatening or life-altering injuries. 

An investigation into the incident is now under way.

Thanking people who had already come forward with information, the assistant chief constable asked anyone who had relevant CCTV or dashcam footage to call police on 101.

It has been recently reported that Evan Ferguson was nominated for the PFA Young Player of the Year award following a breakthrough 2022-23 season

Striker Evan Ferguson got his loan spell at Roma off to a perfect start by scoring a hat-trick within 24 minutes and four goals in total on his debut.

The  forward, who joined the Serie A side on a season-long loan this week, scored with a header from a corner within eight minutes against UniPomezia, who have been promoted to Serie D.

The 20-year-old then latched on to a through ball and fired high into the roof of the net for his second before the Republic of Ireland striker completed his hat-trick with a close-range finish. 

His impressive first outing for his new side was capped on the hour mark when he fired low into the bottom corner before being substituted soon after.

I Giallorossi, in their second pre-season match under new manager Gian Piero Gasperini, won the game 9-0.

Ferguson joined Roma on loan from the Seagulls after struggling with injuries and loss of form in the past 18 months.

Prior to his four goals for Roma he had netted just once at club level since November 2023.

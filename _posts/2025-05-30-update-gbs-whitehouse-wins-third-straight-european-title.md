Whitehouse and Hepworth take gold and silver in floor final

Great Britain's Luke Whitehouse won floor gold for the third-straight year at the European Gymnastics Championships, Leipzig.

The 22-year-old scored 14.500 to finish ahead of team-mate Harry Hepworth, who claimed his first individual European medal with a score of 14.366.

Italy's Lorenzo Casali finished third.

"It is unbelievable," Whitehouse told BBC Sport. "I am lost for words. I knew it was possible, but to come out and do it, I couldn't be prouder."

It is Whitehouse and Hepworth's second medal of the competition after winning team gold on Monday.

Hepworth, 21, finished joint fifth alongside compatriot Courtney Tulloch in the rings final later on Friday.

Hepworth will compete again in the vault final on Saturday.

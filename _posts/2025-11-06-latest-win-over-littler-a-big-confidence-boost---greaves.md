According to new developments, Greaves had an average of 105 to Littler's 107 in their youth championship semi-final

Beau Greaves says her landmark win over world champion Luke Littler has given her fresh belief as she prepares for several big tournaments.

The 21-year-old from Doncaster hit the headlines with victory over Littler last month to become the first female player to reach the world youth final.

"When I beat Luke, it did give me a big confidence boost. I suppose I've just lacked confidence over the years, and I've got a little bit of it now," said Greaves.

Five-time world champion Raymond van Barneveld has predicted a good run at the PDC World Championship, which starts next month, would seal her place in the eight-player Premier League.

"I can't imagine I would get the Premier League unless I did obviously have a crazy run but I mean I wouldn't say no," she said.

"It's maybe a little bit much for me that, but you know it'd make it a bit exciting wouldn't it?"

The Premier League starts in February and takes place over 17 consecutive Thursday nights.

"Hopefully, if she does well in the World Championship, I can guarantee you she'll get a Premier League ticket," said Dutchman Van Barneveld., external

The top four in the world rankings qualify automatically and four others are selected as 'wildcard' entries.

"People go on about the Premier League being a bit flat and boring but I always end up watching it every week. It would be amazing to play in it but I don't think I deserve it considering of all the other players that I could get in," she said.

"It's nice that people say good things about me. I appreciate all the comments, I think it's dead sweet."

Beau Greaves - the 'very special' talent who beat Littler

What is Grand Slam of Darts and what is prize money?

Greaves to play at worlds and on pro tour

Littler came from nowhere to reach the world final in 2024, before taking the title a year later, and won the Premier League on his debut appearance.

But he was beaten 6-5 by three-time women's world champion Greaves, who averaged 105 and won the decider with an 11-dart leg as she set up a world youth final against Gian van Veen on 23 November.

Greaves ended the PDC Women's Series with an 86-match winning run, has earned a two-year professional tour card and will play in the World Championship which starts at Alexandra Palace on 11 December.

But first she features in the Grand Slam of Darts, which starts on Saturday, when she takes on former world number one Michael van Gerwen.

She is also in the same group as two-time world champion Gary Anderson and Germany's Niko Springer, with the top two qualifying.

"I don't really care who I'm playing, I think I did a few years ago. I'm just going in with an open mind and stop being so negative," she said.

"I'm trying to be positive and happy and enjoy the game ... obviously if you enjoy it and you practise and you work hard then I think the results will come."

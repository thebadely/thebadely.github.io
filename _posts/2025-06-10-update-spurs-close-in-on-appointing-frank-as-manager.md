According to new developments, Brentford finished 10th in the Premier League last season - 18 points clear of Tottenham

Tottenham are closing in on appointing Brentford manager Thomas Frank as their new head coach by the weekend.

Talks between the clubs are ongoing and have progressed positively amid a growing expectation Frank could even be confirmed in the next 48 hours as Ange Postecoglou's successor.

Discussions are understood to be amicable and there is a will from all parties to conclude the agreement quickly.

BBC Sport understands that recently appointed Spurs chief executive Vinai Venkatesham, who only started work last Monday, has been involved in the process of appointing Frank, alongside chairman Daniel Levy.

Brentford are entitled to compensation for the 51-year-old Frank, who joined them in 2016 after a stint with Brondby, with sources indicating it will cost Tottenham Â£10m to release him from his contract.

That amount could rise based upon how many members of staff the Dane decides to bring with him.

Frank took charge at Brentford in 2018, after his initial spell as assistant boss, and guided them into the Premier League, winning the Championship play-off final at Wembley in 2021 and establishing them as a top-flight club on a small budget.

Brentford finished 10th in the 2024-25 Premier League season, seven places and 18 points above Tottenham, who ended in 17th spot and won just 11 of their 38 games in the competition.

Australian Postecoglou was sacked 16 days after leading Tottenham to victory in the Europa League final, their first major trophy for 17 years.

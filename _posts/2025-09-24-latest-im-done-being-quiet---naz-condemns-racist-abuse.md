Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Jess Naz has spent all but one season of her senior career with Tottenham

Tottenham forward Jess Naz says she is "done being quiet" after receiving racial abuse on social media.

The 24-year-old posted on Instagram that she had been "subjected to racial abuse in my DMs" following Tottenham's penalty shootout victory over Aston Villa in the Women's League Cup.

She wrote: "I was going to wait till after the game to speak because I'm done being quiet. I was subjected to racial abuse in my DMs.

"Racism in any form is unacceptable and is important to address this behaviour and ensure that steps are taken to prevent it from happening again."

Tottenham said: "The club is disgusted by the racist abuse received by Jessica Naz via social media.

"Jess has spoken out against this disgraceful behaviour - and we stand by her in calling out this unacceptable and cowardly act.

"We are working with the appropriate authorities and social media platforms to identify the responsible party, and we will be taking the strongest action against them.

"There is no place for racism in our sport or anywhere in society. We stand with Jess."

Naz joined Tottenham from Arsenal in 2018 and has started every match across the Women's Super League and Women's League Cup this season.

She also has six England caps.

Last month, the men's Premier League match between Liverpool and Bournemouth was briefly stopped in the first half after Cherries forward Antoine Semenyo reported being racially abused by someone in the Anfield crowd.

That came days after Tottenham forward Mathys Tel was the subject of racist abuse on social media. He had been one of two Spurs players to miss in their Super Cup penalty shootout defeat by Paris St-Germain.

England defender Jess Carter was also the target of racist abuse during Euro 2025 in July.

That led to the England team deciding to stop taking the knee before matches, with manager Sarina Wiegman saying the impact of the anti-racism gesture was "not good enough".

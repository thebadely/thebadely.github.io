Experts revealed that Tesco has apologised after IT problems left some customers unable to alter online orders or access digital versions of their Clubcards.

People took to social media to complain about a series of problems with the company's website and mobile app on Friday afternoon.

"We have fixed a software issue that temporarily impacted customers using our website and app this afternoon," a Tesco spokesperson told the BBC. 

"We're sorry for the inconvenience."

Customers on social media listed multiple problems with its services, including being unable to process changes to online orders.

Tesco's account on X replied to one user saying it was having "intermittent system issues at the moment which the IT team are currently working hard to resolve."

Outage monitoring site Downdetector showed increased levels of reported problems with Tesco's website and app shortly after 14:00 BST. 

Reports began to decline roughly two hours later.

The supermarket chain - the UK's biggest - said in early 2024 that its Clubcard loyalty scheme, offering shoppers discounts on products in-store and online, had more than 20m members.

One social media user said on X they had been encountering issues with the supermarket's app and website for about four hours.

Tesco told them in a reply that the services were experiencing "technical issues" and asked them to "try again later".

Others have said they were unable to pull up their Clubcard on their Tesco app to collect points or use vouchers while shopping.

Two other major retailers Marks and Spencer (M&S) and the Co-op have suffered massive disruption in recent weeks, in their cases due to cyber attacks.

There is no suggestion Tesco's problems were due to hackers.

Experts revealed that Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano have shared 20 rounds together

Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano face off in the ring for a third time on Friday at Madison Square Garden in New York.

The trilogy encounter is unprecedented for a major female boxing rivalry and Taylor is two wins to the good against Serrano.

But both fights were incredibly close and so the multiple-weight world champions return to the scene of their first, now classic, 2022 bout.

There is also a stacked undercard with Britain's Ellie Scotney, Ramla Ali, Savannah Marshall and Chantelle Cameron all in action.

Everything you need to know about the event is below.

Live text commentary will begin from 01:00 BST on the BBC Sport website and app.

You will be able to follow most of the undercard, including Scotney and Marshall's world title fights.

BBC Sport will bring you daily coverage from New York in fight week with Steve Bunce delivering episodes of his 5 Live Boxing with Steve Bunce podcast.

Serrano and Taylor are two of the most active boxers in the world and have fought in a combined 76 professional bouts

Taylor and Serrano have two of the best records in boxing, not just the women's game.

Serrano is a seven-weight world champion while Taylor is among an elite club in the modern era to win undisputed titles in two weight classes.

Taylor, 39, has 24 wins and just one loss on her record, a 2023 defeat by Cameron she avenged in her next fight.

Serrano, 36, is one of the most experienced pro-female fighters on the scene today with 47 wins, three losses and one draw on her record.

Taylor has two victories over Serrano, while the other defeat was way back in 2012 at super-featherweight to Frida Wallberg.

We saw in the first fight how their styles gelled perfectly and just how many punches were thrown between them. A combined 320 punches were landed over the 10 rounds and after 20 rounds that figure rose to 861 punches.

Taylor won a narrow split decision in an instant classic at MSG three years ago.

The Irishwoman suffered her first defeat since then while Serrano became undisputed champion at featherweight as she amassed five more wins.

Their fight last November was another epic as Taylor leaned on her reactions and experience while a badly cut Serrano refused to take a backwards step. Remarkably, after 40 minutes we still haven't seen a knockdown.

Taylor and Serrano's two fights couldn't have been much closer. The first encounter was a split decision for Taylor while the rematch was a little wider for the Irishwoman.

Cardio and grit for both women was a massive factor in each fight, with Taylor digging deep to stay on her feet at MSG before Serrano battled through a terrible cut above her eye through much of the rematch in Texas.

On both occasions, Serrano slammed her foot on the gas from the very first bell, throwing a huge amount of punches. She out-landed Taylor in both fights, with 324 punches to Taylor's 217 in the rematch.

But the volume wasn't enough for Serrano as she failed to put a real dent in Taylor. The defending champion used her counters and speed to deal with the onslaught and landed more of the meatier shots.

While Serrano had visibly hurt Taylor in the first fight, she was unable to rock her rival in the rematch.

Will either woman come out with a different game plan for the trilogy or will we see another all-action firefight?

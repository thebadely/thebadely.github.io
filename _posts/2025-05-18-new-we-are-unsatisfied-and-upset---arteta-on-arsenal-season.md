Arsenal still chasing the dream - Arteta

Mikel Arteta says he is "unsatisfied and upset" that Arsenal are finishing another season without a major trophy.

The Gunners manager delivered a powerful and emotional speech as he addressed fans at Emirates Stadium after Sunday's 1-0 win over Newcastle - Arsenal's final home match of the season.

The result guarantees Arsenal a place in next season's Champions League but it is now five years since the Gunners last won a major trophy - the FA Cup in 2020.

They were comfortably beaten to the Premier League title by Liverpool, were knocked out of the Champions League and Carabao Cup in the semi-finals, and went out of the FA Cup in the third round.

Arteta said he is ready to "give his life" to deliver a trophy for Arsenal.

"Liverpool have a trophy - we don't have a trophy," Arteta, who has delivered one FA Cup since he was appointed head coach in December 2019, said in his media  conference. 

"We are unsatisfied and upset. But I think we are on the right trajectory.

"What I can promise is that I will do my very best [to win a trophy] and I will give my life, and get every drop of everybody here to squeeze it and get the best out of them."

Asked whether he thought fans still backed him, Arteta added: "That's what I feel but they want more, they have expectations. We need to believe we are going to do it together."

Some fans had left the stadium when Arteta stepped on to the pitch minutes after the final whistle to thank supporters for their backing this season.

"We had a dream, it was to be here or in a week's time and bring the big trophies to you guys and we couldn't do it for many circumstances," he said. 

"We need to make sure that chasing a dream doesn't get blurry and make sure we chase the dream with positivity and enthusiasm for next season.

"We have to start creating our own history here in this stadium and we started this season. There is much more to come and it won't be easy. These players have the talent.

"We need to rest and finish at Southampton and then go on holiday."

Arsenal will secure a third successive second-placed finish in the Premier League if they avoid defeat at already-relegated Southampton on the final day of the season next Sunday.

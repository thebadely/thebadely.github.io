Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Brian Barry-Murphy signed a three-year contract at Cardiff when he took charge in June

Brian Barry-Murphy says Cardiff City will not change their style as they look to cause a Carabao Cup shock at Burnley on Tuesday (19:45 BST).

Cardiff have won praise for their front-footed approach under Barry-Murphy, who has energised the Bluebirds since taking charge in the summer.

Barry-Murphy suffered his first defeat in 11 games at the helm as Bradford City won 3-1 at the Cardiff City Stadium last Saturday.

Cardiff now face the challenge of taking on Premier League opposition, but Barry-Murphy insists there will be no change in the way his side plays.

"We have to be as aggressive as possible for the players to understand this is the way we are going to be," the Irishman said.

"How successful that will be will depend on how well we do it and how effective the opponents are, so this will be a different level of challenge for us.

"But it's one we are excited about because we believe our players can do it. We just have to show that week to week."

Burnley were promoted from the Championship last season, banking 100 points as they missed out on the title to Leeds United on goal difference.

They have made an encouraging start to the new Premier League campaign, with four points taken so far and their only home defeat coming in unfortunate fashion against Liverpool.

The Clarets thumped Cardiff at Turf Moor in August last year and also beat the Welsh side in the return fixture in March.

Scott Parker's team have beaten Derby County in this season's Carabao Cup after entering at the second-round stage, while Cardiff have seen off Swindon and Cheltenham to set up the trip to Lancashire.

"I am really excited to go to a Premier League team in a competition where we have produced really good performances," Barry-Murphy added.

"It's a good test for our players. Burnley have a super-talented squad and to test ourselves in that stadium against them will be very good for us."

Cardiff have fitness concerns over Ronan Kpakio, who came off during the Bradford loss with a foot problem, and Dylan Lawlor, who missed the Bantams' visit with a groin injury.

"We have a group we really believe in," Barry-Murphy said. "We will see who is OK and then pick a team."

Let's dive into the details: Ella McCaughan cracked 16 boundaries in her 60-ball knock, falling for 106 in the final over

Ella McCaughan hit the first women's T20 Blast century to inspire Hampshire Hawks to a thumping win over Essex at a sun-drenched Chelmsford.

Playing in front of watching England coach Charlotte Edwards, the 22-year-old opener cracked 16 boundaries and shared a competition best stand of 173 with Australian Charli Knott before departing for 106 from 60 balls as the Hawks posted 195-2.

The right-hander has now scored 327 runs across five knocks in this season's competition, averaging more than 81.

Essex made a solid start to their reply but Hawks skipper Georgia Adams posted figures of 4-26 as her side picked up a bonus point for a 42-run win, restricting their hosts to 153-8 and closing the gap on the top three in the standings.

Essex won the toss and elected to bowl first but McCaughan was soon put down on four behind the stumps by Lauren Winfield-Hill after a top-edge, but the breakthrough arrived early as Maia Bouchier got a leading edge to Essex skipper Grace Scrivens in the second over, chipping a catch to Maddie Penna to depart for four from five deliveries.

Knott joined McCaughan and also received another life on nine, with Winfield-Hill missing a stumping, and the Australian made the hosts pay, bringing up her half-century from 39 balls with her seventh four, off Sophia Smale, though she might have been caught just inside the deep square rope by Cordelia Griffiths.

Having raced to her fourth half-century in five innings from just 34 balls, McCaughan kept the pedal down and picked up a single to move to 90 off Esmae MacGregor to retain strike for the penultimate over.

A reverse sweep for four off Smale took McCaughan past Bouchier's 92 in the 25-run win against Essex at Southampton on 30 May - the previous highest score in this season's competition.

She brought up three figures with a single from the 57th delivery she had faced but holed-out to Smale at long-on off Scrivens in the final over to end the 173-run stand with Knott.

Freya Kemp hit one of her two balls to the rope to end unbeaten on five while Knott finished 72 not out from 55 deliveries with seven fours, having previously scored just 37 combined across her first three T20 appearances for the Hawks.

The hosts were 46-0 at the end of the six-over powerplay in reply, with Scrivens finding the boundary four times and Winfield-Hill doing so twice, but Winfield-Hill drove straight to Knott at cover to depart for 18 in the seventh over off Daisy Gibb, bringing Lissy Macleod to the middle.

Macleod began positively but with the hosts falling behind the required rate, Scrivens miscued Mary Taylor to opposite number Adams at extra cover to depart for 29 from 28 balls to leave the hosts 66-2 at the end of the ninth over.

Knott took a fine catch inside the rope at long-on to see the end of Griffith and leave Essex 82-3 midway through the 12th over.

Taylor was fortunate to pin Australian Penna in front for one in the next over to pick up her second scalp before Macleod was run out by a direct hit from Freya Davies to leave her side 90-5, ending a bright knock of 30 from 18 balls, with six fours.

The hosts reached three figures in the 14th over and Jo Gardner and Smale set about hauling their side to the 156-run mark to deny the visitors a bonus-point win in a tight fight for the top three spots in the table.

They added 42 in 25 balls before Smale was lbw for 24 from 16 deliveries trying to sweep Adams at the start of the 18th over and Gardner fell to a diving catch at long-off from Kemp for 18 to give Adams a second wicket in the over.

The skipper had 11 runs to play with in the final over in order to secure the bonus point, and tempted Eva Gray (6) into skying to extra cover as she finished with figures of 4-26 and restricted the hosts to 153-8 to leapfrog them into fourth in the table, three points behind the Bears, having played a game fewer.

Hampshire centurion McCaughan told the ECB Reporter's Network: "That was one of the good days. I had some luck early and just tried to cash in.

"I didn't really expect to make a hundred to be honest. Things are going well and I'm trying not to overthink it, keep my game simple and it seems to be working.

"I'm not trying to hit big sixes, I'm playing the same way as I usually do, but just with a bit more intensity in T20 and staying present.

"I didn't feel great at the start of the partnership with Charli, but we tried to run hard and we both got into it as we went along.

"It's a long season and it's still early, so I want to keep doing what I'm doing and having success."

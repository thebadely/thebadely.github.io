Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Teenager Findlay Curtis repaid Russell Martin's faith in Rangers' first-leg win over Panathinaikos

While fresh faces have arrived at the dawn of a new Rangers era, Russell Martin has continually reiterated his openness to be surprised by members of the squad he inherited.

It would be fair to assume Findlay Curtis files into that category after the teenager was trusted to start on the left of Martin's attack in his first competitive match in charge at Ibrox.

The first leg of the Champions League second-round qualifier against Panathinaikos was just a sixth Rangers appearance for the 18-year-old. It was only his second start.

"He has the athleticism and talent to play in his team for sure, but he also has the character," Martin explained pre-match.

With Rangers looking nervy and vulnerable in a first half Martin described as "uncomfortable", Curtis eased growing tension by demanding the ball, driving inside, and unleashing a stunning strike to ignite Martin's reign.

A first goal in senior football, it was a moment that swung momentum and had former Rangers wide men waxing lyrical.

"Brilliant, son. He's a cool cat this kid, I tell you," ex-Ibrox winger and coach Neil McCann said on Premier Sports. "That's a fantastic finish, I love that," was the view of Peter Lovenkrands on BBC Sportsound.

Martin on Rangers' victory over Panathinaikos

Martin said Curtis "had some tough moments" in the opening half, but on his first start on the European stage, the youngster responded to almost single-handedly shift the mood and the course of the game at Ibrox.

Six minutes after opening the scoring, another delicate touch and driving run from the teenager resulted in Panathinaikos' Georgios Vagiannidis picking up a second yellow card.

That sending-off allowed Rangers to take control of a contest that was overwhelming them in the opening period, and Curtis' replacement, Djeidi Gassama, sealed a vital two-goal first-leg win with another fine strike.

"We expected it to be tough - they are a really good team," Martin told BBC Scotland. "We had some uncomfortable moments in the first half.

"We were far from the finished article, but the players showed character and a willingness to fight and to run for each other. And, as the game went on, they started to look after the ball better."

In a difficult opening period, Curtis was not alone in toiling. After a bright opening few minutes, Rangers ceased any control by continually giving up possession as the visitors spurned multiple chances.

Panathinaikos had managed 22 touches in the opposition box by the interval, while Rangers were on just six.

The hosts had goalkeeper Jack Butland, restored to the starting line-up after being dropped at the end of last season, to thank for at least three excellent saves.

Martin hailed Butland as an "outstanding goalkeeper" before challenging his players to approach next week's second leg, which will be shown live on the BBC, with "the same mentality and the same willingness to run and more".

Former Rangers striker Steven Thompson expressed caution despite a "perfect" first-leg result.

"Maybe [the result] doesn't tell the full story of the match," he added on BBC Sportsound. "Until the sending-off, Panathinaikos were well in the game.

"Rangers have put themselves in a great position, but it's not over yet. European football is difficult and Panathinaikos will feel they have something to prove."

What did you make of Rangers' display in Martin's competitive debut?

What did you think of Curtis' performance and Gassama's impact? And what about Butland's response to returning to the side?

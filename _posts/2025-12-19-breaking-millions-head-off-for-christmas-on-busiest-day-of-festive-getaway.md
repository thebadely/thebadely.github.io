Experts revealed that Festive travellers have taken to Britain's roads, railways and airports for the busiest day for Christmas trips.

Some of Britain's largest airports are expected to reach new passenger records for December, with about 460,000 journeys planned for Friday alone.

Traffic on motorways around the country was expected to reach a peak on Friday afternoon, with about 24.4 million cars predicted to be hitting the roads.

Network Rail has also advised travellers to check their journeys, book a seat if possible and allow extra time.

RAC mobile servicing and repairs lead Nick Mullender said motorists should expect lengthy delays at peak times on Friday.

"We're expecting queues of more than half an hour from 4:30pm along the M25 clockwise from J15 for the M4 to J19 Watford and anticlockwise from Kingston to East Grinstead. In Manchester, the M60 clockwise from J7 Altrincham to J18 for the M62 for Leeds will also be busy this afternoon," he said.

The AA, which provides traffic updates across the UK, said congestion was occurring in the usual hotspots and was being amplified by the bumper number of vehicles on the road.

On Friday afternoon there was heavy traffic on:

The AA said this Christmas could be the busiest on record for UK roads, and advised drivers to allow extra time to complete their journeys.

The insurance company said most people driving during the festive period travelled less than 100 miles, meaning congestion is likely around motorway interchanges and retail destinations.

The M27 will be closed between Junction 9 (Whiteley/Park Gate) and Junction 11 (Fareham East/Gosport) from Christmas Eve to 4 January, so anyone travelling in Hampshire should plan alternative routes.

AA patrol expert Shaun Jones said patience behind the wheel "will be your best present this year".

"Today marks one of the busiest days of the Christmas getaway, with millions of drivers expected to hit the roads," he said. 

"With more than 24 million car journeys forecast today, our advice is simple: plan ahead, check live traffic updates before you set off, and allow extra time for your journey."

Friday is also expected to be the busiest day of the festive season for airports.

Heathrow Airport is expecting to record its busiest ever December and Christmas Day, with about 250,000 passengers a day travelling through the airport.

Manchester Airport is also on track for a record Christmas period, and Friday is expected to be the busiest day with about 100,000 passengers.

In the lead up to the busy period, the airport's managing director Chris Woodroofe said there were several things passengers could do to ensure they had a smooth experience, including checking in ahead of time and taking gifts through security unwrapped.

"You want your presents to be opened by your loved ones, not our security staff," he said.

Edinburgh Airport estimates nearly 250,000 people will pass through the airport between Friday and Christmas Eve, heading to destinations including Tenerife and Paris.

Staff at Gatwick Airport are expecting 741 scheduled flights across Friday, just shy of a peak of 757 flights expected on 28 December.

The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said flying on Christmas Day was becoming more popular.

It advised customers to know their rights in case their flight is cancelled or delayed.

If this happens, airlines are required to support passengers. This can include:

If your flight is cancelled, and it is covered by UK law, your airline must let you choose between either getting a refund or being booked on to an alternative flight.

Network Rail also encouraged passengers to allow extra time for train travel. Improvement works taking place over the Christmas period mean several routes will be closed or restricted.

Information on what routes will be closed for repairs can be found on the Network Rail website.

National Rail trains do not run on Christmas Day and only a small number will run on Boxing Day.

Daniel Mann, director of industry operations at the Rail Delivery Group, said: "We encourage customers to reserve seats where possible, bring only luggage that is easy to carry and fits in designated storage areas, and allow extra time for their journeys."

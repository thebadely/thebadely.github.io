Wales' players job to reignite the flame for fans - Dewi Lake

Autumn Nations Series: Wales v New Zealand

Venue: Principality Stadium, Cardiff Date: Saturday, 22 November Kick-off: 15:10 GMT

Coverage: Commentary on BBC Sounds, BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru and live text on BBC Sport online.

Dewi Lake is hoping Welsh rugby can emulate Welsh football by achieving something special this weekend.

Craig Bellamy's side defeated North Macedonia 7-1 at Cardiff City Stadium to confirm their World Cup play-off place.

Lake will lead his side against New Zealand on Saturday with Wales looking to pull off a huge shock by beating the All Blacks for the first time since 1953.

Almost nobody is giving Wales a chance but Lake hopes the rugby side can inspire a nation like the football players who they share a training base with.

"We were all down around the TV watching them play last night," said Lake.

"The way they played excited the nation and that's something we've spoken about as a group.

"It's our job is to reignite the flame in supporters' bellies, for them to feel energised when they're in that stadium or at home watching us. 

"That's something the football team did very well, so it's on us to repeat it this weekend."

Wales v New Zealand - all you need to know

Wild celebrations but Wales face reality check

Wales have lost their past 33 matches against New Zealand since the previous victory 72 years ago.

Steve Tandy's side are ranked 12th in the world and the All Blacks 10 places higher, so ending that losing streak is very improbable.

"I think Wales have always been massive underdogs in any kind of international Test match against a team like New Zealand," said Lake.

"It's always been loved by us being underdogs, kind of not being given a chance, I suppose. 

"It's about going out there and doing everything we can to win, because ultimately that is what we want."

Lock Dafydd Jenkins has this week stated the squad believe they can win and Lake says that sentiment has to be shared by the home side.

"We wouldn't be here if we didn't think we could win," Lake told BBC Radio Cymru.

"There's no point being in the building if we thought we couldn't win. 

"We're excited about the challenge that is coming, but we're confident also that we have enough to take it to them too."

Wales can stun All Blacks - lock Jenkins

Lake, 26, will be experiencing playing a senior international against New Zealand, although he was part of the Wales Under-20s side that defeated the Baby Blacks in the 2019 Junior World Championships in Argentina.

"Facing New Zealand is something you dream about as a kid," said Lake.  

"We know they're an excellent team, so we'll have to be on it from the start but there's a lot of excitement."

New Zealand coach Scott Robertson is under pressure after the All Blacks lost 33-19 against England to miss out on a November northern hemisphere Grand Slam.

"England played very well against them on the weekend," said Lake, who has played 24 internationals.

"They got a lot of joy out of going into the air, picking up the second balls, things like that.

"That's probably something that's been a weakness over the first two games."

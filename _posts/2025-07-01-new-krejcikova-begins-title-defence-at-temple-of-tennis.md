Experts revealed that Last year Barbora Krejcikova added the Wimbledon title to her 2021 French Open triumph

Wimbledon 2025

Defending Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova said she is happy to be back playing at the "temple of tennis" as she avoided a first-round upset with victory over promising youngster Alexandra Eala.

The Czech had been an injury doubt coming into the tournament but showed her experience in a 3-6 6-2 6-1 win when she opened Tuesday's play on her return to Centre Court.

Krejcikova beat Italian Jasmine Paolini in last year's final to lift the trophy but has been hampered by injury problems this year.

She endured a lengthy lay-off with a back issue, then had to pull out of Eastbourne last week because of a thigh problem.

Many anticipated her lack of match fitness - she has only played six matches this year - had laid the foundations for an upset at the All England Club against up-and-coming 20-year-old Filipino Eala.

"I was more excited than last year, definitely," Krejcikova said.

"I was feeling more of the happier emotions than I did last year. It's just great to be back - great to be playing in the temple of tennis. 

"It's just a very, very special place here."

Krejcikova's preparations for the tournament were not dissimilar last year, when she arrived at the All England Club having played just nine matches and struggling with injury.

Returning to the site of her emotional triumph, the 17th seed was keen to take in the experience of arriving as defending champion, spending time admiring the Venus Rosewater Dish before walking out on court.

"I really enjoyed the walk from the locker room down the stairs in front of the door to the court," she added.

"When it opened, it was just a very beautiful and very joyful experience. This was really something that I was looking forward to since last year. I'm really happy that I had this opportunity to experience it."

Despite that joy, Krejcikova looked somewhat out of sorts in the opening set against an in-form opponent.

Eala memorably stunned Iga Swiatek at the Miami Open in March, then made more history by becoming the first Filipina to reach the final of a WTA Tour event at Eastbourne last week, where she lost to Australian teenager Maya Joint.

That has catapulted her to 56th in the rankings, and all of that talent was on display on day two at the Championships.

The pair traded breaks early on as Krejcikova's exquisite lob to take Eala's serve was cancelled out by a double fault to put the match back on serve.

Mistakes from the reigning champion and an impressive range of shots from Eala secured a second break, and this time Krejcikova could not convert her break-back opportunity, missing the forehand on break point.

She seemed to be struggling on serve, uncomfortable with her ball toss and hit five double faults in the first set - perhaps an indication she is still battling that back injury.

After a lengthy game at 5-2 where Krejcikova saved a set point, Eala held her nerve to brilliantly serve out the set.

Krejcikova came back in the second set and, while she still looked uncomfortable on serve - frequently redoing her ball toss - she motored to a 5-0 lead.

Looking somewhat disappointed and desperate to avoid a second-set bagel, Eala rallied to hold her serve, then overturned one of the breaks, but could not prevent Krejcikova levelling the match.

A more comfortable third set followed as Krejcikova tidied up the errors and finally showed her emotion as she put herself on the brink of victory by securing the double break for 5-1, letting out a roar after her passing winner.

And a similar outburst of emotion followed as she booked her place in the second round.

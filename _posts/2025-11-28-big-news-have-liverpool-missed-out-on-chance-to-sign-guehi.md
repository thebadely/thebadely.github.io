It has been recently reported that Marc Guehi captained Crystal Palace when they won the Community Shield against Liverpool in August

In 34 days, Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi will be free to complete a move to a European club when his contract expires on 30 June.

The 25-year-old can sign a pre-contract agreement with a foreign club when the winter transfer window opens on 1 January 2026.

Liverpool missed the chance to buy the England centre-back for Â£35m in the summer. The transfer saga, which lasted throughout the window, ended when Palace were unable to sign a suitable replacement - a decision driven by manager Oliver Glasner.

It meant the south London club missed out on a significant fee for Guehi with only one year left on his contract, but retained their talisman after losing Eberechi Eze to Arsenal a week earlier.

Liverpool remain keen to revive their pursuit, though there are no guarantees the move will materialise.

Guehi now has other options and it is understood top clubs in Europe have already registered an interest.

But he is not the only high-profile centre-back who might be available on a free transfer next summer.

Liverpool's own Ibrahima Konate has also been linked with a move to Real Madrid at the end of his contract, potentially following in the footsteps of former defensive partner Trent Alexander-Arnold.

However, reports on Friday morning suggested Real Madrid have ended their apparent pursuit, with BBC Sport unaware of any concrete interest.

His uncertain future has been widely cited as a factor for his poor form.

Real Madrid could lose defenders Antonio Rudiger, 32, and David Alaba, 33, this summer with both about to enter the final seven months of their contracts.

It leaves Guehi and Dayot Upamecano as options if they are to enter the free market to strengthen at centre-back - a strategy they have used several times in recent seasons.

Real Madrid do hold an interest in Marc Guehi and he fits a clear squad need at centre-back.

Dean Huijsen has emerged as a starter, but Eder Militao and Antonio Rudiger have both had injury issues. Rudiger is now in his thirties, Raul Asencio has not fully convinced and David Alaba has lost pace after a long spell on the sidelines.

Guehi, a proven Premier League defender with personality, speed and plenty of good decisions, is seen as the kind of stabilising presence who can challenge immediately for minutes.

His case sits alongside Madrid's broader market strategy: three kinds of deals. First, the young talent who can grow into a superstar. Second, the 'free' but established player, where heavy signing-on fees replace transfer costs (the case of Guehi next summer).

And third, the big-fee signing reserved for specific players viewed as instant starters.

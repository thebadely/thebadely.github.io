According to new developments, Egypt and Iran have been drawn in 2026 World Cup Group G alongside Belgium and New Zealand

A 2026 World Cup fixture designated by organisers as an LGBTQ+ 'Pride Match' will feature two countries where homosexuality is illegal.

The local organising committee in Seattle, one of the host cities for the Fifa tournament next summer, have said the match at the city's Lumen Field on 26 June will feature celebrations of the LGBTQ+ community.

The plans were put in place before the teams involved in the fixture were selected or the draw for the 2026 World Cup was made.

And following Friday's draw and Saturday's fixture allocation, it has been confirmed that the game on 26 June in Seattle will be the Group G match between Egypt and Iran.

In Iran, the maximum punishment for homosexual relations is the death penalty, while in Egypt, morality laws are frequently used to suppress LGBTQ+ rights and relationships.

The event - which is organised solely by the local committee and is not affiliated with Fifa - will take place on the Friday of Seattle's official Pride weekend, with artists in Washington state invited to submit designs of artwork, external celebrating LGBTQ+ people for display around the game and city.

The Seattle Pride Match Advisory Committee, set up by organisers to help with the event, say the game will still go ahead as planned.

A spokesperson told LGBT news outlet Outsports:, external "The Pride Match has been scheduled to celebrate and elevate Pride events in Seattle and across the country, and it was planned well in advance.

"Soccer has a unique power to unite people across borders, cultures, and beliefs. We are honoured to host a Pride Match and to celebrate Pride as part of a global football community. 

"This match reflects our ongoing commitment to respect, dignity, and unity for all."

It is not the first time an attempted gesture of support for LGBTQ+ people at the World Cup has run into issues.

At the 2022 World Cup in Qatar - which also has laws against same-sex relationships - Fifa said players that wore the OneLove armband in support of LGBTQ+ people would receive yellow cards. 

England and Wales were among the teams who had planned to wear the band, but decided against it following Fifa's ruling.

BBC Sport has contacted Fifa, the Seattle organising committee and the Egyptian and Iranian Football Associations for comment.

Ieuan Evans 'disappointed' at Wales' Lions squad quota

Wales legend Ieuan Evans has urged his countrymen overlooked for the British and Irish Lions tour to Australia to ensure they are ready for call-ups in the event of injuries to the party.

Andy Farrell named only two Welshmen in his 38-strong squad, Wales captain and flanker Jac Morgan and scrum-half Tomos Williams, the fewest from the nation since the fifth Lions tour in 1903.

Since the end of World War Two the lowest number of Welshmen to tour had been five, to New Zealand in 1993 with Evans, now Lions chairman, among them.

Speaking after announcing the 2025 tour party, Evans said he was "disappointed" for his countrymen, whose 17-match losing run helped ensure far greater representation from Ireland, England and Scotland.

"This is about Andy Farrell and his team selecting the very best players with the very best dynamic to fit going on a British and Irish Lions tour, with all the challenges of playing Saturday, Wednesday, Saturday, Wednesday and having that fit together," he said.

He added: "Even getting into the mix of selection is challenging to begin with, but then to find your way to actually get on the plane; but things do change, things happen, injuries and so on, so you've got to be ready for that.

"Now that challenge for the group of players in Wales to fight for the next tour, but also making sure you perform now because you never know what's going to happen on that tour [to Australia]. 

"I've been on enough tours to know things change, injuries happen."

Cardiff veteran Taulupe Faletau, a three-time tourist, Ospreys hooker Dewi Lake, Exeter lock and captain Dafydd Jenkins, Dragons back row Aaron Wainwright and Scarlets back-three star Blair Murray were touted as potential Lions for the coming tour.

But none made the cut, leaving only Wales captain Morgan and Gloucester's ex-Cardiff half-back Williams to win Farrell's vote.

Evans says his fellow countrymen have the chance to make their mark and earn Test places.

"It's a blank sheet of paper and they start from scratch," said the former Llanelli and Bath wing.

He added: "It's now about forcing your way into Test selection and that's by forging combinations, partnerships and impressing the coaches when you're out there with your performances and your training. 

"That's the next challenge for this group of players and I'm sure the Welsh players will do exactly that."

Morgan was on a flight that had landed in South Africa with Ospreys when he discovered he was to become a Lion.

He said after a "tough couple of years" it was a "massive honour" to earn a Lions spot.

He added: "I didn't really expect anything, really, especially with the competition in the back row... the competition is massive."

Williams was at home and said: "I have got to admit I did shed a tear.

"The last two days I've been an emotional wreck. Grateful for my parents, my partner Laura and everyone who has helped me.

"The top of the mountain. You cannot get much higher than this achievement.

"I'll get a bit of stick for this, no doubt."

Former Wales centre Jamie Roberts, an impressive Lions tourist in 2009 and 2013. echoed Evans' thoughts, saying Wales' low representation was "a reflection" of where Wales are and injuries could yet allow opportunities to arise.

He added: "But for Jac and Tomos, I mean, we're super proud to have those lads on tour.

"They've both been in fine form the last season, and rightly, deservedly, have been selected for their first tours. 

"I think our ambition as a Welsh rugby nation is that we fast forward to four years time, and hopefully we increase on that number and we look to the future."

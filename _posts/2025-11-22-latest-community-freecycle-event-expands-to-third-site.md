Here’s what you need to know: A recycle and reuse event that aims to reduce costs to families and save items from being thrown away, has expanded to another town.

The Forest Exchange project in Coleford, Gloucestershire, allows people to donate items they no longer need so others can make use of them.

The items on offer at the "face-to-face freecycle" event include things such as books, clothes and household items.

Volunteer Louise Penny said the project, which started as a community scheme in nearby Lydney, has been going from "strength to strength" over the last three years.

"We wanted to widen it further into the Forest [of Dean] which is great because it show's how much of a success it's been. It's going from strength to strength," she said.

Previously known as The Lydney Exchange, the scheme has branched out across the district to now cover Cinderford and Coleford, where it will be known as the Forest Exchange.

"People can just come along to our events and get whatever they want really," said Ms Penny.

"We do have wide range of things, books, clothes, household items that people might want and we're actually running out of men's clothes at the moment.

"We have masses of women's clothes."

Ms Penny said it is an event where everyone can "take what they need and give what they can".

The Forest Exchange event in Coleford is supported by local Pastor Sam Davis and will be opened by Mayor Nick Penny.

The event will be held at Coleford Baptist Church on Saturday and will run from 13:00 to 15:00 GMT.

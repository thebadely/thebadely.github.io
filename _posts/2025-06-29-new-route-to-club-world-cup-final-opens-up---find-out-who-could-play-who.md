Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca is three games away from winning a second trophy with the club following the Conference League

Half of the Fifa Club World Cup quarter-final ties have been set - and teams can start plotting a route to the final.

Chelsea, one of England's two representatives, will play Palmeiras on Saturday, 5 July (02:00 BST).

The Blues reached this stage with an extra-time win over Benfica - in a game that was delayed for two hours because of the weather.

European champions Paris St-Germain play Bayern Munich later that day (17:00 BST) in a meeting of two heavyweights.

There are four remaining last 16 ties to be played - including Manchester City v Al-Hilal on Tuesday, 1 July (02:00 BST).

The last 16 draw in full:

28 June: Palmeiras 1-0 Botafogo (AET)

28 June: Benfica 1-4 Chelsea (AET)

29 June: PSG 4-0 Inter Miami

29 June: Flamengo 2-4 Bayern Munich 

30 June: Inter Milan v Fluminense (20:00 BST)

1 July: Manchester City v Al-Hilal (02:00 BST)

1 July: Real Madrid v Juventus (20:00 BST)

2 July: Borussia Dortmund v Monterrey (02:00 BST)

Chelsea already know their opponents, Brazilian side Palmeiras - whose teenage forward Estevao Willian joins the Blues after the tournament. That game is in Philadelphia.

PSG v Bayern Munich is a repeat of the 2020 Champions League final.

If Manchester City get past Saudi side Al-Hilal, they would play either Inter Milan or Brazilians Fluminense in Orlando.

The quarter-final draw in full:

4 July: Inter Milan/Fluminense v Man City/Al-Hilal (20:00 BST)

5 July: Palmeiras v Chelsea (02:00 BST)

5 July: PSG v Bayern Munich (17:00 BST)

5 July: Real Madrid/Juventus v Borussia Dortmund/Monterrey (21:00 BST)

Manchester City and Chelsea would meet in the semi-finals if both sides get that far.

That game would be played on Tuesday, 8 July (20:00 BST).

The other semi-final, 24 hours later, would see PSG or Bayern Munich potentially play Real Madrid, if Xabi Alonso's side can get through the next two rounds. 

Both the semis and the final are being played in New Jersey's MetLife Stadium - which also hosts the 2026 World Cup final.

The final will be played on Sunday, 13 July at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey (20:00 BST).

There is no third-place play-off.

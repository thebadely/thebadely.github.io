Former NFL wide receiver Antonio Brown has been extradited from Dubai to the United States to face a charge of second degree attempted murder relating to a shooting incident in May.

The Miami Police department said the former Pittsburgh Steelers, New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers player was "located in Dubai and was apprehended" before being "extradited to Essex County, NJ (New Jersey), by US Marshals".

They added Brown was being held there prior to being moved to the Miami-Dade County Jail.

Following an investigation into the incident in May, police issued an arrest warrant in June which alleged Brown took a gun from a security guard and fired two shots at a man he had brawled with earlier on.

No arrests were made at the time and no injuries were reported.

Brown, 37, had been detained by police at the time of the incident before being released.

"I was jumped by multiple individuals who tried to steal my jewellery and cause physical harm to me," claimed Brown in a social media post. "Contrary to some video circulating.

"Police temporarily detained me until they received my side of the story and then released me. I went home that night and was not arrested."

Brown played for the Buccaneers and scored a touchdown as they beat the Kansas City Chiefs to win the 2021 Super Bowl.

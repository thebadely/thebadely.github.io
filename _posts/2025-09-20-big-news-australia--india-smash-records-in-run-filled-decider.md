It has been recently reported that Australia batter Beth Mooney hit 138 - her highest score in all three international formats

Third ODI, Delhi

Australia 412 (47.5 overs): Mooney 138 (75), Voll 81 (68), Perry 68 (72); Reddy 3-86

India 369 (47 overs): Mandhana 125 (63), Sharma 72 (58), Harmanpreet 52 (35); Garth 3-69

Australia won by 43 runs; win series 2-1

Australia beat India in a remarkable series decider in Delhi that set a new record for the most runs scored in a women's one-day international.

Beth Mooney hit a career-best 138 on Saturday, reaching her century off 57 balls - at the time the joint second-fastest hundred in women's ODIs.

Opener Georgia Voll, who was dropped three times, struck 81 off 68 and Ellyse Perry added 68 off 72 to help the tourists post 412 - their joint-highest ODI total - despite being bowled out with 13 balls left.

India opener Smriti Mandhana surpassed Mooney by smashing a century off just 50 deliveries, but her 125 and half-centuries from Harmanpreet Kaur and Deepti Sharma were not enough as the hosts were dismissed for 369 to lose by 43 runs.

The aggregate of 781 runs scored across both innings is a record in women's ODIs, beating the 678 shared by England and South Africa at Bristol in 2017.

It is also the highest aggregate total in all women's List A cricket, going past the 779 accumulated by Bengal and Haryana in India's Senior Women's One-Day Trophy at Rajkot in 2024.

Mandhana ton leads India to big win over Australia

Formidable Australia beat India in opening ODI

The highest aggregate total in both men's ODIs and List A matches is 872 between South Africa and Australia at Johannesburg in 2006.

Australia's 412 is the joint sixth-highest total by a side in women's ODIs, equalling their national record when they made 412-3 against Denmark at the 1997 Women's World Cup in Mumbai.

Mandhana also hit a century in India's thumping 102-run win to level the series in the second ODI. She is the second batter to hit back-to-back ODI hundreds after England's Tammy Beaumont.

Only former Australia captain Meg Lanning has made a quicker century in women's ODIs - off 45 balls against New Zealand in 2012.

The 111 boundaries - 99 fours and 12 sixes - hit at the Arun Jaitley Stadium is also a record in women's ODIs.

Victory extends Australia's run of winning every bilateral ODI series of the 11 they have played against India.

Australia have won nine consecutive ODI series since they lost 2-1 to England in the 2023 Women's Ashes.

A thrilling series, which started with a formidable win by Australia before India hit back with their own comprehensive victory and concluded with this run-fest, underlines why the sides are the two favourites for the 2025 Women's World Cup.

The 50-over tournament, hosted by India and Sri Lanka, starts on 30 September, with the hosts facing each other in Guwahati, before Australia begin their title defence on 1 October against New Zealand in Indore.

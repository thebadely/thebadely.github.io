Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Leigh Leopards missed out on the Grand Final after losing to Wigan

Leigh Leopards owner Derek Beaumont has confirmed the club have made an official complaint to the Rugby Football League (RFL) over the build-up and stewarding in Friday's Super League play-off semi-final at Wigan.

The fixture took place with heightened security after the previous day's terror attack in Manchester, controversy over the ticket allocation and in poor weather conditions at the Brick Community Stadium.

In an open letter to fans issued on Monday, Beaumont has doubled down on pre-match criticism about ticket allocation, calling the treatment of Leopards' fans "despicable".

"Unfortunately, I have had many letters and messages, some from significant kit sponsors, containing footage of the despicable treatment bestowed upon thousands of our fans in our semi-final," said Beaumont.

"People were queuing in poor weather conditions whilst they were physically searched, something that wasn't consistent in other areas at the ground and wasn't in operation at Old Trafford the following day," he said, referencing Saturday's Manchester United-Sunderland fixture.

"I want to assure everyone that all the letters, messages and videos that I and the club receive will be forming part of our official complaint and will also be provided as part of the full review that will be conducted by the RFL."

The build-up to the semi-final, which Wigan won 18-6, was complicated by Leigh suggesting they might boycott the match in protest at a ticket allocation of only 4,800.

The RFL announced on Saturday that an independent panel will investigate the circumstances surrounding the match, with senior executive director Nigel Wood insisting lessons will be learned.

"The build-up to last night's game was unprecedented and has highlighted learnings for the future, which an independent panel will review following this weekend's fixtures," he said.

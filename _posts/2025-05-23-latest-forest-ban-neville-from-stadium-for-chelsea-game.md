It has been recently reported that Neville made 85 appearances for England between 1995 and 2007 and has become a leading pundit since retiring

Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville has said Nottingham Forest have banned him from the City Ground for their final Premier League game of the season against Chelsea on Sunday.

The former Manchester United and England defender said he was informed by the broadcaster that Forest "would not give me an accreditation or access to the stadium as a co-commentator".

"I've had no choice but to withdraw from the coverage," the 50-year-old added on Instagram.

BBC Sport has contacted Nottingham Forest for comment.

Neville criticised Evangelos Marinakis on X after the Forest owner marched onto the pitch and spoke animatedly with manager Nuno Espirito Santo following the late goal by Leicester City in the 2-2 draw earlier this month.

"Scandalous from that Forest owner. Nuno should go and negotiate his exit tonight with him! The Forest fans, players and manager do not deserve that," Neville wrote on X the same day.

'A winner, imposing, controversial' - who is Forest owner Marinakis?

Forest later denied Marinakis' exchange with Nuno was a "confrontation" and described subsequent reaction to the situation as "fake news".

The club said the incident was because of Marinakis' frustration that striker Taiwo Awoniyi had continued to play after an 88th-minute injury, which subsequently required urgent surgery.

"I've dished out my fair share of criticism and praise in the last 14 years of doing this job and have never come close to this unprecedented action," Neville said.

"Whilst they have every right to choose who they let into their own stadium, it's symptomatic of things that have happened over the last 12 months with the club."

Seventh-placed Forest can qualify for next season's Champions League on Sunday if they beat Chelsea at the City Ground and other results go their way.

"Personally, I think it's disappointing that a great club like Nottingham Forest have been reduced to making such a decision," Neville added.

"I wish the coaching staff, players and fans of the club all the best in their quest to achieve Champions League football."

The Premier League said accreditation was a club matter.

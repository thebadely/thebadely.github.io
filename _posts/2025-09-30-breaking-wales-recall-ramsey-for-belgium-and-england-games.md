Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Aaron Ramsey played for Arsenal, Juventus and Cardiff before joining Pumas in Mexico

Wales have recalled captain Aaron Ramsey for October's World Cup qualifier against Belgium and friendly with England.

The 34-year-old midfielder was omitted from the squad for matches against Kazakhstan and Canada earlier this month, having made only one substitute appearance in six months as he recovered from injury.

But Ramsey has since started three games and played in another two from the bench for his Mexican club side Pumas UNAM.

Wales are able to welcome back Leeds United pair Ethan Ampadu and Joe Rodon, Coventry City defender Jay Dasilva and Wrexham forward Nathan Broadhead, after they all missed the Kazakhstan and Canada fixtures because of injury.

Leeds winger Dan James is included despite an ankle injury, which is "undergoing assessment" according to his club.

A Leeds spokesperson said: "Any absence is not expected to be long-term and Leeds United manager Daniel Farke will provide a full update during Thursday's press conference."

Wales face England in a friendly at Wembley on Thursday, 9 October before hosting Belgium in a World Cup qualifier at Cardiff City Stadium the following Monday.

What Wales need to do to reach the World Cup

On Ramsey's recall, head coach Craig Bellamy said: "He's fit. I haven't had that luxury with him. 

"When I look back at that first game [against Turkey in September 2024] he was immense. He has the brain. That's never going to go.

"We have legs in and around him that could really benefit from his type of profile. What I've seen is a player fit that still has a lot to offer in the way we play. He's a player I massively admire."

Wales still have a chance of qualifying automatically for the 2026 World Cup but, sitting third in Group J, they need other results to go their way.

North Macedonia are top on 11 points with three games to go, one point ahead of Wales and Belgium, who are above Bellamy's men on goal difference and have a game in hand on both their rivals.

Whoever finishes top automatically qualifies for the finals, while the runners-up book a place in the 16-team play-offs in March.

Even if Wales finish third, they are all but guaranteed a play-off spot having won their Nations League group last year.

But if they want to qualify automatically, they will need to win all three of their remaining matches and hope that Belgium drop points more than once, not only in Cardiff.

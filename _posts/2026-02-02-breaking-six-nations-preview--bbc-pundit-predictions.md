According to new developments, France won their first Six Nations title since 2022 last year

Last year's Six Nations featured more tries than any previous championship, with 101 scored across 15 matches.

Champions France ended the tournament with 30 of them - the most in a single Six Nations campaign - and Les Bleus wing Louis Bielle-Biarrey's eight tries broke the record for most in a single Six Nations campaign.

This year's campaign has the potential to be as tight as ever, and promises to offer similar entertainment value.

This is the report card for each of the sides as they head into the tournament - and what a selection of BBC pundits think of their chances.

France won the Six Nations last year, with their sole defeat against England at Allianz Stadium.

Captain Antoine Dupont ruptured cruciate ligaments in his knee in round four against Ireland but Fabien Galthie's side got over the line without their talisman.

The scrum-half is back and will want to remind the rugby world of what he can do on the biggest stage, but they are without prop Uini Atonio, who has been forced to retire with a heart problem.

"I tried to get a good part of the injury off and spend it with my family and friends, so I can do other things and come back with more mental freshness," Dupont told BBC Radio 5 Live.

Galthie showed that no player is safe in his squad by leaving out France's all-time top try-scorer Damian Penaud, number eight Gregory Alldritt and veteran centre Gael Fickou.

Will that bold call pay off? The fixtures could aid their chances, with games against Ireland and England at home meaning Les Bleus have a strong chance of retaining their title.

"France have threats all over the park. How they differ from any other team in the Six Nations would be the fact that if they lose five of their top players, it doesn't matter," La Rochelle head coach Ronan O'Gara told BBC Sport.

"France have a mentality of there is very little between certain players in certain positions - with the exception being Dupont."

Why is the Six Nations starting on Thursday?

Steve Borthwick's side go into the competition as genuine contenders, arguably for the first time in his reign as England head coach.

England last won the competition in 2020 but are on an 11-game winning run.

With their young talent now more settled in Test rugby, it feels like the next step for Borthwick's squad is to win a title.

Young back rowers Henry Pollock and Guy Pepper have broken into the matchday squad, while Tommy Freeman and Immanuel Feyi-Waboso are backs with real threat.

A potential Grand Slam decider in Paris awaits, with Borthwick openly saying he dares his side to dream of glory.

"The sky is the limit for these players, there's so much growth in them," Borthwick told BBC Sport.

"My job is to help them go execute on matchday. I believe we've got depth and competition that helps drive standards."

Having won back-to-back titles in 2023 and 2024, Andy Farrell missed last year's competition because of his British and Irish Lions commitments. 

Ireland did only lose one game to France but have since struggled to regain the form that brought so much success.

Farrell's squad have a number of injuries in key positions, with their three front-line loosehead props all out.

Fly-half also remains a position under discussion, with Leinster's Harry Byrne now putting pressure on Sam Prendergast and Jack Crowley.

Games away to France and England are therefore daunting, but it may also be an opportunity for new talent to emerge from a settled group.

"We are hunting again and not being hunted, but that doesn't mean much," Farrell told BBC Radio 5 Live.

"It is about what is in front of your face and your preparation. How you can connect as a team and grow.

"It is all about getting to that first game in Paris and believing what we are about as a team."

Ireland injury list 'larger than normal' - Farrell

Glasgow's domestic and European form has brought positivity to Scottish rugby after a mixed autumn campaign.

Despite the undeniable talent available, Gregor Townsend's side have struggled to deliver consistently in the tournament, finishing fourth two years in a row.

"The expectation is always high for our team," Townsend said.

"I think on paper it is the best team we have had."

And Italy (away), England (home) and Wales (away) could be three ideal fixtures to gather early momentum for a title charge.

Bath fly-half Finn Russell, 33, enters the tournament on the back of a successful Lions tour and has the quality to push Townsend's side to new heights.

Captain Sione Tuipulotu - another summer Lion - is back after missing last year's Six Nations.

"Everyone goes into the tournament to lift the trophy," he told BBC Sport.

"It would be a special moment for everyone to be the first Scottish team to do it."

Can unfancied Scots be Six Nations contenders?

The days of resting a few key players against Italy are long gone.

Gonzalo Quesada's side have vastly improved over a number of seasons, although they were unable to build last year on their record points haul of 11 from the 2024 campaign.

Their one win in last year's tournament came against Wales and that will be the minimum goal again.

Tommaso Menoncello, 23, is established as one of the best centres in the tournament, but Italy will be without exciting 19-year-old winger Edoardo Todaro.

The final-round game against Wales in Cardiff may well be a Wooden Spoon decider, but Quesada's side will have eyes on an additional 'statement' win.

In his first Six Nations, head coach Steve Tandy is tasked with avoiding a third consecutive Wooden Spoon.

Home games against Scotland and Italy look favourable on paper, but Wales have struggled to be competitive in the past two tournaments.

Wins over Japan in the summer and autumn mean Tandy goes into the tournament without a horrible losing-run cloud looming over him and the side.

He can also call on half-backs Tomos Williams and Dan Edwards, who look to be a strong pairing and are in good form.

Louis Rees-Zammit's return to rugby also brought a freshness to Wales in the autumn and his star power - on display with a wonderful finish against New Zealand - will undoubtedly help.

"I've loved seeing him play full-back for Bristol Bears," Tandy told BBC Sport.

"He was brilliant for us against New Zealand, the way he was in the air and we know what a threat he is."

A big blow is that captain Jac Morgan - Wales' only Test Lion from the summer - will miss the start of the tournament because of dislocated shoulder, with Dewi Lake taking over as skipper.

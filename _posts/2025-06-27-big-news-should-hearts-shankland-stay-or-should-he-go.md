Experts revealed that Lawrence Shankland has 16 caps for Scotland

Heart of Midlothian travel to Spain for a pre-season training camp this weekend, just over two weeks out from their opening match of the new season against Dunfermline Athletic on 12 July.

Of the travelling group, one name is conspicuous by its absence, that of talismanic striker Lawrence Shankland, whose contract with the club expires at the end of this month.  

Since Hearts brought Shankland back to Scotland in 2022, he has established himself as one of the most reliable goalscorers in Scotland's top flight.

He has scored 68 goals in Hearts colours in 137 appearances across all competitions. There's an old adage about good strikers scoring one in two - and Shankland does that.

Hearts expect Shankland decision 'within days'

That form, along with Shankland's contract situation, explains the long-standing speculation over the Scotland international. A mooted move to Rangers never transpired and links to West Bromwich Albion appear to have gone cold.

New Hearts head coach Derek McInnes has made no secret of his desire to keep Shankland in Gorgie and tie him down to a new deal, with conversations between player and club ongoing.

Optimism is rife among Hearts supporters after Brighton and Hove Albion owner Tony Bloom completed a Â£9.86m deal to buy a 29% stake in the Edinburgh club.

But will Shankland hold out for a move to England or back overseas? Or will he want to be part of Bloom's "disruption" and lead the line in maroon again next season?

The fact that Shankland has not made it clear he is leaving is cause for optimism for both McInnes and Hearts supporters.

McInnes is evidently and understandably excited at the prospect of working with the 29-year-old, but will Shankland sign on the dotted line to link up with the club's new team boss?

Hearts will hope the chance to be part of their new project, with tried-and-tested performer McInnes in the dugout and Bloom's gravitas in the boardroom, is enough to persuade their star man.

However, uncertainty over Shankland's future has been clouded further still as McInnes heads to Spain without him.

"I really feel Lawrence as part of a strong Hearts team can elevate himself," McInnes said earlier this week. 

"I think he's capable of scoring 25-30 goals a season in the right team and used in the right way.

"We can offer security. We can offer building a team and being part of a team that's trying to be successful."

With Bloom aiming to "disrupt the pattern of domination which has been in place for far too long" in Scottish football, there is an expectation Hearts will attack the transfer market.

Right-back Christian Borchgrevink, winger Alexandros Kyziridis, striker Claudio Braga, centre-half Stuart Findlay and midfielder Oisin McEntee have already signed in the early knockings of the window, while Elton Kabangu joined permanently after last season's loan spell.

Beyond the ambition of the McInnes-Bloom project, the prospect of playing under the immediate gaze of Scotland head coach Steve Clarke would be another perk of staying in Edinburgh for Shankland.

One word. Goals.

"When you get the ball into dangerous areas, Lawrence Shankland will score," former Hearts midfielder Michael Stewart said on Sportscene at the end of last season.

"A guy that is capable of banging in 20-plus goals a season doesn't grow on trees."

Stewart is right. Shankland has passed the 20-goal mark in the Premiership twice in the past three seasons - no other player has done so.

Kyogo Furuhashi did it once for Celtic, Cyriel Dessers once for Rangers and Kevin van Veen once for Motherwell. 

Beyond that, Shankland brings experience and leadership, having captained Hearts during goalkeeper Craig Gordon's long injury absence.

He has amassed more than 150 Premiership appearances in addition to 16 Scotland caps. 

Had Shankland's contract expired 12 months prior, the suitors would have been piling up to sign him on a free given his goal-scoring feats in the 2023-24 season, during which he bagged 31 goals in all competitions.

The season just gone was less prolific and, as he approaches 30, Shankland is likely considering how many high-profile moves or high-paying contracts he has left in his career.

"He's at a stage in his career where he's looking to maximise his earning potential, which is completely understandable," Stewart said.

It explains why Hearts are yet to hear from him regarding the offer on the table.

However, no deal has been done, suggesting any alternative offers received by Shankland were not to his liking. With pre-season about to get under way, things will come to a head in the coming days.

Steven Naismith, who was Hearts boss during Shankland's free-scoring 2023-24 season, added: "Like any player, there are more options when you're out of contract.

"It gives you a chance to sit and think what's best for you at this stage in your career, but he'll want it sorted before pre-season starts."

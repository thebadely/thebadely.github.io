According to new developments, Freddie Mercury has been commemorated on a new collectable coin, coinciding with the 40th anniversary of his legendary Live Aid performance. 

Issued by The Royal Mint in Llantrisant, the coin is the latest addition to its Music Legends series, honouring Britain's most influential singers and songwriters.

The design depicts Mercury mid-performance, alongside his autograph. The singer's four-octave vocal range is represented by a musical stave encircling the coin from bass to treble, while a studded armband etched along the edge pays tribute to his iconic Live Aid outfit.

To celebrate the release, Mercury's sister Kashmira Bulsara visited The Royal Mint to strike the first coin herself.

She said: "Striking the first coin at The Royal Mint was such an emotional and proud moment for me. 

"Freddie would have been absolutely delighted to see himself honoured in this way and to know that his family was part of bringing this tribute to life.

"The coin perfectly captures his passion and the joy he brought to millions through his music."

In a fitting tribute to Mercury's philanthropic legacy, The Royal Mint will also donate a special gold proof version of the coin to the Mercury Phoenix Trust, the Aids charity founded in his memory. 

The charity will auction the unique piece in the coming months, continuing Mercury's mission to support those affected by HIV and Aids.

Freddie Mercury, born Farrokh Bulsara in 1946, was the lead vocalist and pianist of the British rock band Queen. 

He grew up in Zanzibar and India before his family fled to England in 1964 during the Zanzibar Revolution. 

In 1970, Mercury formed Queen with guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor, going on to write many of the band's defining hits, including Bohemian Rhapsody, We Are the Champions and Don't Stop Me Now.

Known for his theatrical and charismatic stage presence, he also went on to pursue a solo career. 

In 1991, Mercury died at the age of 45 from bronchial pneumonia, a complication of Aids.

He left behind a legacy as one of the greatest singers in the history of rock music and was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004.

The special coin's release comes 40 years after Queen's famous Live Aid performance in July 1985. 

Hailed by many as one of the greatest live shows of all time, the band had not originally been scheduled to appear at the benefit concert for the 1983-1985 Ethiopia famine.

During the 21-minute performance, the band opened with an excerpt from Bohemian Rhapsody, before transitioning into an accelerated rendition of Radio Ga Ga, as the audience clapped in unison with Mercury. 

He then led the 72,000-strong crowd in an improvised call-and-response "Aaaaaay-o" chant, later dubbed The Note Heard Round the World.

The set concluded with a shortened We Will Rock You and We Are the Champions.

Event organiser Bob Geldof later said: "Queen were absolutely the best band of the day. They played the best, had the best sound, used their time to the full. 

"They understood the idea exactly, that it was a global jukebox. They just went and smashed one hit after another. 

"It was the perfect stage for Freddie - the whole world."

The Music Legends coin series is available to buy from The Royal Mint from 18 November.

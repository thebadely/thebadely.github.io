Let's dive into the details: A Shropshire barber is offering "pay what you can" haircuts in December, to help people struggling ahead of Christmas.

Marcus Lewis-Roper opened MLR Adonis Barbers in Bridgnorth seven weeks ago, and will work longer hours - from 09:00 to 21:00 GMT - on 22 December, offering the service to those who need it.

"I know that Christmas is quite a tough time for some people, including people that have got children, people that are on their own… people can't really afford much," he told the BBC.

"I feel that offering a haircut out actually makes people feel good about themselves, you come into the barber shop and you want to better yourself and make yourself feel better.

"They don't even have to pay for their haircut if they don't want to, they can pay a pound, they don't have to pay anything, or they can pay the full price."

He said a few long-standing clients had offered to pay for other people's haircuts on the day too.

"It's nice to see people from the community coming together to support each other."

The cuts, done in 30 minute slots, are organised via a booking system, to make the experience more private.

"That time that they book the 30 minute slot will be their time and their time only," he said.

"They can then go to the box that'll be put in the window - I'm just happy they're leaving feeling good about themselves."

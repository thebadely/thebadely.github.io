According to new developments, McIlroy and Lowry were at the centre of Europe's celebrations on Sunday evening

Europe's players celebrated a knee-knocking 15-13 Ryder Cup victory over the United States in New York by trolling Donald Trump.

"Are you watching, Donald Trump?" sang the victorious players in response to Rory McIlroy receiving a text message from the US president, who is a well-known golf fan.

And Trump, who made a brief appearance at the Bethpage Black course on Saturday, took it well, writing on social media: "Yes, I'm watching. Congratulations!"

"I'm glad he liked and enjoyed it," Europe captain Luke Donald told BBC sports editor Dan Roan.

"We were having a moment together with the team, and Rory got a text from the president. We read it out and thought [we'd have] a little bit banter [with him].

"He seemed to take it in good spirits."

McIlroy has played golf with Trump and last week spoke about his affinity for the United States. He called it "the land of opportunity" and "the best country in the world".

The Northern Irishman also acknowledged Trump as he walked past him on the first tee on Saturday.

The European celebrations, as they were in Rome two years ago, were in full swing on the coach back to their Long Island hotel.

Footage has emerged on social media of Shane Lowry leading the team in singing a popular chant created for McIlroy by the European fans.

Irishman Lowry, a good friend of McIlroy's is stood in the middle of the coach screaming "he's in your head, he's in your head, Rory, Rory, Rory..." to the tune of the 1990s Cranberries song 'Zombie'.

The video echoes McIlroy leading the celebrations in Italy in similar fashion.

Head century hands Australia emphatic first Test win over England

Zak Crawley â 1

Backed for Australian conditions but returned only the fourth Ashes pair by an England opener in just 11 balls faced.

Ben Duckett â 5

Got starts in both innings. His dismissal on Saturday was when it began to unravel for England.

Ollie Pope â 6

Looks better for technical tweaks. The first Test of a series is usually his best, then it goes downhill. England need him to kick on.

Joe Root â 1

Miles away from that first hundred in Australia. England need the nous of their best player if they are to come back from this.

Harry Brook â 5

His half-century in the first innings was skittish, but valuable. Awful shot in the second innings.

Ben Stokes â 6

Came back from injury with a five-wicket haul, though looked short of rhythm with the bat. Lost control in the field in the face of Head's assault.

Jamie Smith â 4

Could have the game for Australia, but needs to smarten up. Can expect plenty of short bowling from now on.

Gus Atkinson â 5

Part of the impressive England first-innings bowling effort and tried to carry the fight with the bat in the second innings. Part of the attack that fell apart on Saturday evening.

Brydon Carse â 5

See above, with added mustard of being taken apart by Head.

Jofra Archer â 5

Looked awesome with the ball in the first innings and was the best of a bad bunch in the second. Could still have an impact on the series.

Mark Wood â 5

Went wicketless, but massively impressive to even get on the field given his time away.

'Top class' Head century has Australia cruising towards win over England

Jake Weatherald â 6

Debutant was unlucky to be exposed to Jofra Archer in the first innings, then played his part in the sensational run chase.

Usman Khawaja â 3

A bizarre Test. Did not look fit and spent time off the field. Held on to a couple of key catches at slip, but also looked immobile in the cordon. Gets a mark for the injury that allowed Travis Head to open.

Marnus Labuschagne â 7

A successful return to the team. Absorbed England's pressure better than most in the first innings, then supported Head in the second.

Steve Smith â 5

Looked out of sorts in the first innings. Needless pre-match attack on Monty Panesar.

Travis Head â 9

Possibly churlish not to get the full 10, but he played a pretty ropey shot in the first innings. His second-innings hundred was an all-time great.

Cameron Green â 5

Took the crucial wicket of Ollie Pope in the first innings. Rattled by a Mark Wood bouncer when he batted. Barely needed in the second half of the match.

Alex Carey â 5

Attempted a counter-attack against England's bowlers on the first evening. Tidy behind the stumps.

Mitchell Starc â 9

Carried the weight of the attack without Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood with the first Australian Ashes 10-wicket haul in 20 years.

Scott Boland â 6

Short of his best in the first innings. Improved in the second to spark the England collapse.

Brendan Doggett â 6

Solid debut. More than capable stand-in for Cummins and Hazlewood.

Nathan Lyon â 2

Virtually a spectator in a match dominated by pace. Possibly picked up an injury when struck by Mark Wood.

Here’s what you need to know: Tottenham v Slavia Prague begins at 20:00 GMT on Tuesday 

Tottenham's LGBTQI+ supporters group has criticised opponents Slavia Prague after the Czech club requested the relocation of a flag for Tuesday's Champions League match.

The Progress Pride rainbow flag is usually located in the north-east corner of Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, which houses the visiting fans.

In a statement, Spurs said the flag has been "relocated at the request of the visiting team to Uefa on security grounds".

Proud Lilywhites said: "You don't get to come to our house and dictate what's acceptable, let alone kick off about a flag that represents our own community."

The group alleged Slavia "raised concerns" supporters "may damage the flag and cause disorder" if it was not moved.

Uefa sources told BBC Sport the presence of Spurs' badge on a flag within the away end created the issue.

Slavia Prague have been contacted by BBC Sport. In a statement to the Athletic the club said: "The flag with Tottenham symbols would have been placed directly in the section reserved for our fans at that moment. 

"For this reason, it was temporarily moved in another place in the stadium and with an agreement with the home club. 

"This is a logical step based on respect for the space reserved for visiting fans, just as Slavia fans outside the visiting section respect the rules of not wearing our club colours or symbols."

Proud Lilywhites' flag, present at all Tottenham home games, has been moved in similar scenarios for previous European fixtures. 

No other Tottenham flags are located in the away end.

"The risk here isn't the flag," Proud Lilywhites said in their statement.

"It's the reaction of a small number of opposition supporters. That's disappointing and it's another reminder of the hostility LGBTQI+ fans still face across European football."

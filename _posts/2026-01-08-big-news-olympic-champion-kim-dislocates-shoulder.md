According to new developments, Chloe Kim is the first female snowboarder to win back-to-back gold medals in halfpipe

Olympic champion snowboarder Chloe Kim has dislocated her shoulder just a month before the start of the Winter Games in Milan.

Kim, 25, is aiming to become the first woman to win three consecutive Olympic gold medals in the halfpipe.

The USA athlete will have an MRI scan on Friday after falling while training in Switzerland.

"I hate that I have to make this video," Kim said in a post on Instagram. "I took the silliest fall and that ultimately resulted in me dislocating my shoulder."

"I am not in that much pain," Kim said. "Obviously. I just don't want it to keep popping out, which has happened.

"I feel really good about where my snowboarding is at right now. The minute I get it cleared and I'm good to go, I should be fine. I'm just hoping that that doesn't take too long."

Kim won the halfpipe gold in Pyeongchang in 2018 as a 17-year-old and in Beijing in 2022.

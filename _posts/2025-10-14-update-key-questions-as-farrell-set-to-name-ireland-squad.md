Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Andy Farrell (centre) returns to the Ireland hotseat after his Lions sabbatical 

If the start of new season has felt slightly low-key amid a post-British and Irish Lions comedown, intrigue - at least from an Irish perspective - is set to increase this week. 

On Wednesday, returning head coach Andy Farrell - fresh from his successful debut as Lions boss and a series of interviews to promote his book - names his Ireland squad for next month's autumn internationals. 

But before the squad hop on a plane to Chicago for their stateside reunion with New Zealand on 1 November, several of Farrell's frontline players will face each other in Saturday's United Rugby Championship fixture between Leinster and Munster at Croke Park. 

Farrell returns at an interesting time for Ireland. While the summer tour yielded wins over Georgia and Portugal, the autumn campaign will see Ireland come up against another top-five nation for the first time since a humbling, Six Nations title-wrecking defeat by France nearly eight months ago. 

Now at the midpoint between the 2023 and 2027 World Cups, Farrell faces the usual mix of selection dilemmas and injury concerns before he leads his side into four autumn Tests.

The Ireland squad will be announced at 16:00 BST on Wednesday. 

Times BST

Ireland v New Zealand, 1 November, Soldier Field (20:10)

Ireland v Japan, 8 November, Aviva Stadium (12:40)

Ireland v Australia, 15 November, Aviva Stadium (20:10)

Ireland v South Africa, 22 November, Aviva Stadium (17:40)

Caelan Doris will be desperate to regain fitness in time to face the All Blacks

Captain Caelan Doris is yet to return from the shoulder injury that ruled him out of the Lions squad. 

The 27-year-old, who was appointed skipper this time last year, had surgery after sustaining the injury in Leinster's Investec Champions Cup semi-final loss to Northampton at the start of May. 

Doris is still likely to be included in Farrell's squad, but given his lack of match minutes, the All Blacks game may arrive too soon for him. 

If that proves to be the case, Dan Sheehan or Tadhg Beirne are strong candidates to captain Ireland in Chicago, with Lions Test starter Jack Conan poised to line up at eight.

While Doris may return next month, Hugo Keenan is not available. The full-back, who scored the try that sealed the Lions' series win over Australia, has been ruled out until the new year following hip surgery. 

Joe McCarthy - another Lion - has been struggling with a foot problem. Like Doris, he is expected to be included in Farrell's squad on Wednesday, but a specific return date for the lock remains unclear.

Farrell would have loved to see one of his fly-halves definitively seize the 10 jersey during his Lions sabbatical. 

It didn't quite pan out that way. Sam Prendergast, who made his Test debut in last year's autumn series, began the Six Nations as the starting 10. 

However, after a tough afternoon against a rampant France, he dropped to the bench behind Jack Crowley for Ireland's final game in Italy. 

Neither player made Farrell's Lions squad and they started one summer Test apiece for Ireland, leaving the picture unclear heading into the autumn. 

They are, however, poised to play against each other for the first time in Saturday's interpro at Croke Park. Crowley has enjoyed the stronger start to the 2025-26 season, but both players have one last chance to shape Farrell's thinking before Chicago. 

Harry Byrne has also attracted positive reviews recently. Keen to accelerate his development, he joined Bristol on loan for the second half of the 2024-25 season and impressed in his first Leinster start in over a year against an admittedly poor Sharks side last weekend. 

Byrne, who last played for Ireland in the 2024 Six Nations, may be included in the squad, but the 10 jersey for the All Blacks game is Prendergast or Crowley's to claim. 

With Keenan out, Jamie Osborne is in a strong position to be the starting 15 next month. 

Osborne, of course, can be used at centre, and if Farrell wishes to test the 23-year-old there, he has other options at full-back. 

Jimmy O'Brien started at 15 against Georgia and Portugal, while Mack Hansen has played there on several occasions for Connacht. 

Moving Hansen to full-back would also pave the way for Tommy O'Brien to be given another chance on the right wing. The 27-year-old scored four tries while wearing 14 on the summer tour. 

Ciaran Frawley and Jacob Stockdale - who started at 15 in Ulster's win over the Bulls last weekend - are other potential Keenan deputies. 

Farrell may also look to shake things up in midfield. Bundee Aki, Garry Ringrose, Robbie Henshaw and Stuart McCloskey are all in their 30s, so Farrell may include 21-year-old Connacht centre Hugh Gavin with long-term planning in mind. 

In terms of his pack, Farrell may want a closer look at 6ft 9ins lock Thomas Ahern. The Munster man can play in the second or back rows and featured for interim boss Paul O'Connell in the summer. 

Andrew Porter and Tadhg Furlong remain Ireland's first-choice props, but next month could provide more Test experience for the likes of Jack Boyle and Thomas Clarkson. 

Ireland were second best when the All Blacks visited Dublin last year

Ireland, of course, have happy memories of playing New Zealand in Chicago. Nine years ago, Soldier Field was the stage for their first-ever victory over the All Blacks, with Joe Schmidt's side running out 40-29 winners.

New Zealand have won the past two meetings, though, backing up their 2023 World Cup quarter-final win with a deserved victory in Dublin during last year's autumn series. Revenge will be uppermost in Irish minds.

After returning home, Ireland will host Japan, pitting Farrell against Eddie Jones. 

Another familiar face awaits the following week in Joe Schmidt and the Wallabies. Farrell bested his former mentor to lead the Lions to a series win over the summer, but Schmidt would have taken some satisfaction from his side denying the tourists a clean sweep in the third Test.

Schmidt was originally supposed to leave Australia after the Rugby Championship, but after extending his contract to mid-2026, he will attempt to lead the Wallabies to their first win over Ireland since 2018. 

Ireland conclude their autumn campaign against the Springboks, which may feel like a long overdue decider after last year's drawn series in South Africa.

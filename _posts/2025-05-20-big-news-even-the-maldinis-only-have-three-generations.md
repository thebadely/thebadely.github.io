Hereâ€™s what you need to know: There was an error

Glenn Murray speaks to three members of the four generations of the Hinshelwood family - the most recent of whom, Jack, is making waves at Brighton.

Jack scored an 85th-minute winner against Liverpool on Monday, with his 17-year-old cousin Harry Howell making his debut for the Seagulls.

Jack's father Adam is managing York City in the National League play-off semi-final against Oldham on Tuesday.

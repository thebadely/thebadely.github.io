According to new developments, Voters in some parts of England will elect councillors and mayors on Thursday 1 May.

These are the first local elections since the general election was held in July 2024.

Everyone voting in person will need to show photo ID. 

Elections are taking place in 23 councils across England.

All seats will be contested in:

Six mayoral elections are also happening: in the West of England, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, North Tyneside, Doncaster and – for the first time – in Greater Lincolnshire and Hull and East Yorkshire. 

In addition, council elections are taking place in the Isles of Scilly.

Voters in the Runcorn and Helsby constituency will also elect their new MP on 1 May.

The former Labour MP Mike Amesbury announced he was standing down after his conviction for assaulting a constituent.

No routine elections are taking place in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland.

There are three ways to vote if you are on the electoral roll:

To vote in local elections you must be:

Voters in some areas may have several ballot papers for the different elections taking place.

In council elections, voters generally have one vote for each available seat in an election area - known as a ward or division. However, some large wards have several seats. 

As in general elections, whoever receives the most votes wins. If, for example, there are three seats available, then the top three candidates win. 

Mayors are also elected under this system, known as first-past-the-post.

EU citizens cannot vote in the Runcorn and Helsby parliamentary by-election.

The deadlines to register to vote, request a postal vote or apply for a proxy vote have all passed. 

However, if you are already on the electoral roll and realise at the last minute that you will not be able to vote in person as planned, you can apply for an emergency proxy vote up until 17:00 on polling day.

Your proxy - the person nominated to vote on your behalf - must also already be registered to vote.

You must show photo ID in order to vote in person. You do not need your polling card. 

There are more than 20 acceptable forms of ID, including passports, driving licences and - from 1 May - Armed Forces Veteran Cards. 

You can use out-of-date ID as long as you are still recognisable.

Anyone who is already registered to vote but doesn't have the correct ID - or who no longer looks like their photo - can use a free document known as a voter authority certificate.

The deadline to apply for a certificate to use in the May elections has passed. 

You must not take selfies or any other photographs inside a polling station. 

With the exception of assistance dogs, animals are not usually allowed in polling stations, but can be admitted at the discretion of the local authority.

You are welcome to bring your children but they must not mark your vote on the ballot paper.

Writing implements are provided but you can bring your own pen or pencil.

You can wear political clothing but you must not discuss any of the candidates inside the polling station. 

Different types of councils are responsible for a variety of local services. These include:

What is council tax and how much is it going up?

Six mayors will be elected on 1 May:

A single authority mayor is the political leader of the council. They are responsible for delivering local council services.

Metro mayors are regional leaders who chair combined authorities, which are groups of several local councils. 

They set out plans to boost their local economy, and have some powers over housing and transport.

Northumberland is the only council expected to declare its results overnight, with most councils not beginning counting until later on Friday morning.

Four mayoral results are also expected by Friday morning - in North Tyneside, West of England, Greater Lincolnshire and Doncaster. 

Results from the other local authorities and the remaining two mayoral contests in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough and Hull and East Yorkshire are expected by Friday evening. 

It is not clear when the result of the Runcorn and Helsby by-election will be announced. 

At the general election in July 2024, the outcome was known fairly early - at around 02:25. 

Detailed BBC election guidelines are written and published for each election, setting out the approach it has to take on polling day.

The BBC, like other broadcasters, is not allowed to report details of campaigning or local election issues on TV, radio or online on polling day until 22:00, when voting closes.

While polls are open, it is a criminal offence to report any exit polls, which aim to predict election results on the basis of surveys of how people say they have voted.

References to the local elections on the day are normally restricted to uncontroversial factual accounts, such as the appearance of politicians at polling stations, the weather, or practical information about how to vote.

Once the polls have closed at 22:00, the election guidelines no longer apply.

However, the BBC must still report the results with the impartiality required both by Ofcom and the BBC's own Editorial Guidelines.

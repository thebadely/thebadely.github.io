Wigan Warriors returned to second in Super League as they held on to beat Warrington Wolves in a Magic Weekend thriller at St James' Park.

Jai Field dived in to put Wigan in front and Bevan French added to their tally soon after before Warrington's Jake Thewlis went in at the corner.

Rodrick Tai ran in for the Wire after the break but Abbas Miski and Adam Keighran tries widened the gap for Wigan.

Joe Philbin's powerful carry over the line set up a tense finale and Thewlis' second clawed Warrington to within two points, but Stefan Ratchford missed the extras as Wigan held on in the final few minutes.

Victory for Wigan means they move back to second place having been bumped down on Saturday by borough neighbours Leigh's win over Catalans.

It is the second time Warrington have lost to Wigan this term, having been on the losing side in Las Vegas in March, but Sam Burgess' side produced a much better display this time despite the result.

Wigan went ahead courtesy of Field's 14th try of the season in all competitions when he received French's offload and spotted a gap before rushing in to cross the line.

French's try swiftly followed, but Wigan were given a bizarre advantage from referee Chris Kendall, who mistakenly obstructed Jake Thewlis before he could try to tackle the Warriors talisman.

Undeterred, Thewlis responded in style to get Warrington going as he went in for their first try, but Wigan kept an eight-point advantage as Ratchford missed his kick at goal.

Warrington, with George Williams, Marc Sneyd and Danny Walker on the sidelines, fielded Oli Leyland and Ratchford in the halves, with Leyland returning to the side for the first time since he was withdrawn in their chastening Las Vegas defeat by the Warriors.

Leyland, an off-season signing from London Broncos, has been on the periphery since that loss and has seen opportunities further limited by the signing of Sneyd, but this was a more assured performance against a side he struggled against two months previously.

Wigan thought they had moved further ahead when Field went in again, but Junior Nsemba was ruled to have obstructed Leyland during the build-up.

It was a case of deja vu when Wigan touched down just before half-time through Kruise Leeming, but it was again chalked off for Nsemba obstructing Leyland in the build-up.

Josh and Jake Thewlis combined in the build-up to Tai's score after the break but Miski ran in with ease following some sensational work from French and Field to send him through as Wigan kept pace.

Keighran added a try to his points tally in audacious fashion - having initially failed to receive a high kick, it bounced fortuitously for Jake Thewlis, but Keighran regained possession when the ball bounced loose and he managed to run in from distance, but not before wrong-footing Matt Dufty on the way to cantering in on the wing.

Warrington ensured Wigan would have to work for the points, however, as Philbin touched down with an outstretched arm with six minutes remaining.

The Wire were not done there - Dufty atoned for the error which led to Keighran's score by battering his way through the Wigan defence and running most of the length of the field before offloading to Josh Thewlis who then teed up his brother Jake to touch down.

Golden point was not to be for Burgess' side, however, as Ratchford could not slot his kick through the posts, meaning Wigan held on for a victory which had looked like it was going to be much more comfortable before a frantic final five minutes.

Wigan Warriors head coach Matt Peet:

"I'm pleased to get the points but I had a feeling it might be that kind of game. I had every faith in the lads but nothing would have surprised me.

"A few years ago everything we were talking about was quickening things up â the play-the-ball, any dead time â without any messaging that we're going in the opposite direction.

"This isn't just about today's game. We've been talking about it for a while. Really strange. I don't think there will be many tired players in that game today."

Warrington boss Sam Burgess:

"I thought we didn't start great and we missed a couple of opportunities, and on reflection we will probably get a little bit more disappointed.

"It would have been nice if we had kicked that goal, but one thing you can't question is the commitment to each other and the bravery to stay in the contest.

"I think our performances have been growing and now we've got a big task next Sunday in the [Challenge Cup] semi-final.

"We need to see how healthy we are from tonight's game but we are looking forward to the challenge and the chance to get to Wembley again."

Here’s what you need to know: Florian Wirtz has been capped 31 times by Germany

New Liverpool signing Florian Wirtz says he wants to "win everything every year" at Anfield after the Germany playmaker joined from Bayer Leverkusen for a club record Â£116m.

The 22-year-old has signed a long-term deal with the Reds, understood to be five years, which will keep him on Merseyside until at least 2030, after completing a medical at the club's training ground on Friday.

The deal, which includes a guaranteed Â£100m and a further Â£16m in add-ons, tops Liverpool's previous club record signing of Virgil van Dijk for Â£75m in 2018. 

Should those add-ons be achieved, Wirtz's move to Anfield would become a British transfer record to beat the Â£107m Chelsea paid Benfica for Argentina midfielder Enzo Fernandez in 2023. 

Wirtz, who scored 57 goals in 197 Leverkusen appearances, is Liverpool's second major signing of the summer and the club's second from the Bundesliga runners-up following the arrival of Dutch right-back Jeremie Frimpong for Â£29.5m last month.

"I would like to win everything every year. First of all, we have to do our work," said Wirtz, whose shirt number will be announced later in the summer.

"Last season they won the Premier League so my goal is for sure to win it again and also to go further in the Champions League. I'm really ambitious.

"I'm really excited to have a new adventure in front of me. This was also a big point of my thoughts: that I want to have something completely new, to go out of the Bundesliga and to join the Premier League.

"I will see how I can perform there. I hope I can do my best. 

"I spoke also with some players who played there and they told me that it's perfect for me and every pitch is perfect, you can enjoy every game. I'm really looking forward to playing my first game."

Wirtz made his top-flight debut aged 17 for Bayer Leverkusen in May 2020 and just 19 days later he became the then-youngest goalscorer in Bundesliga history against the might of Bayern Munich - a club who were also in contention for his signature this summer.

In addition to his goalscoring efforts, Wirtz has provided 44 assists in the Bundesliga since he made his debut.

That ranks him third of all players over that time but everyone else in the top five is aged 29 or older, which indicates the high ceiling for Wirtz's development.

A dynamic playmaker blessed with pace, awareness and the ability to make clever decisions at high speed he was one of the Bundesliga's top performers operating as a number 10.

He was also the most effective dribbler of all players in the German top flight last season, both in terms of volume and accuracy while carrying the ball.

A total of 23 of his 31 Bundesliga appearances in 2024-25 came in an attacking midfield/number 10 berth, although he does tend to drift towards the left wing.

German football expert Raphael Honigstein told BBC Radio 5 Live that Wirtz is "more or less the fully-formed article" and Liverpool are "buying a superstar" who will "bring a lot of class and poise".

"He has played for Leverkusen and Germany so knows the demands that are on him, but still, he will have to adjust to the pace of the Premier League and the more physical way," Honigstein said.

"Opponents will try to negate his influence and that might prove a challenge, but he is young enough and good enough. He is not easily intimidated and stands up strong to the challenge."

The youngest player to reach 50 Bundesliga appearances at 18 years and seven months, he was the face of a fearless and dynamic Leverkusen side. 

He is also an influential dressing room figure despite his age.

"Even early in his Bundesliga career, he carried himself like a leader. He's not the loudest voice in the room, but his presence is felt," said German football writer Constantin Eckner.

Florian Wirtz has become Liverpool's most expensive signing

If Wirtz takes up a place in Slot's midfield, playing as a traditional 10, someone has to miss out, especially in the 4-2-3-1 formation used so effectively last season.

It's unlikely to be Ryan Gravenberch given his rise into the anchoring role, which means Dominik Szoboszlai and Alexis Mac Allister become vulnerable.

The two share similar stats, with Szobozslai creating more 'big' chances across the season, serving up more goals and assists, and Mac Allister being the more combative of the two.

Wirtz could provide an option on the flank, but Liverpool's wide areas appear to be under lock and key. 

Mohamed Salah holds the right side, while Luis Diaz and Cody Gakpo offer variety on the left.

There is a world where Wirtz, or Szobozslai, play in the centre-forward role in a 4-3-3, more as a false nine. 

That system and formation, often used by Slot at former side Feyenoord, which sees the central striker dropping to receive passes, link the play and create room for runs from elsewhere.

It was a style that Roberto Firmino built his legacy with, allowing the relentless Salah and Sadio Mane to prosper from wide berths.

The output of Diogo Jota and Darwin Nunez perhaps points to the central-attacking area being the one where Liverpool lack a man in form.

Wirtz's initial fee means he moves for exactly half the world record, which remains the Â£200m Paris St-Germain paid Barcelona for Neymar in 2017

After seeing his side close out their title-winning campaign with a 1-1 draw against Crystal Palace at Anfield, Slot reflected in an interview with BBC Sport on the club's lack of transfer business last summer.

It was an extremely quiet transfer window, with Federico Chiesa the only immediate signing that was made.

But despite the lack of additions, Liverpool cruised to the Premier League title in Slot's first season in charge.

This time, however, they are doing things differently.

While some clubs are taking advantage of the early window due to playing in the Club World Cup, or to meet Profit and Sustainability requirements, the Reds appear to be doing their business quickly as the best preparation for the new season.

This is also a first proper summer transfer window for sporting director Richard Hughes, who joined the club in March last year from Bournemouth.

At that time his immediate task was identifying and appointing Jurgen Klopp's successor but his full focus now, with more than a year to prepare, has been on player recruitment.

The club are in talks to sign Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez for Â£40m and continue to be linked with signing a new centre-back and a striker.

Despite spending big on Wirtz they are most likely not done yet.

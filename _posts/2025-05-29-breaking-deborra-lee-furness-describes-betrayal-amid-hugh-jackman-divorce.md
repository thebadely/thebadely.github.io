According to new developments, Australian actress Deborra-Lee Furness has said her "compassion goes out to everyone who has traversed the traumatic journey of betrayal", after filing for divorce from her husband Hugh Jackman.

In a statement released to media, Furness, 69, said: "It's a profound wound that cuts deep, however I believe in a higher power and that God/the universe... is always working FOR us."

The couple filed for divorce in New York on 23 May. They announced their separation in September 2023 after 27 years of marriage.

Hugh Jackman, best known for playing Wolverine in the X-men film series, has not responded directly to Furness's statement.

Furness said that she had gained "much knowledge and wisdom" from the "breakdown" of her marriage to Jackman, 56.

"Sometimes the universe has to create arduous circumstances for us to walk through in order to find our way home, back to our true essence and the sovereignty of self love."

"It can hurt, but in the long run, returning to yourself and living within your own integrity, values and boundaries is liberation and freedom," she added, in the statement first issued to the Daily Mail.

When Furness and Jackman announced their separation in 2023, the couple issued a joint statement which they said was "the sole statement either of us will make".

"Our journey now is shifting and we have decided to separate to pursue our individual growth... We undertake this next chapter with gratitude, love and kindness," they said at the time.

The pair met on the set of the Australian TV show Corelli in 1995, shortly after Jackman had left drama school.

They married the following year and later adopted two children.

Since Furness issued the statement, Jackman, currently performing in New York, posted a video to Instagram in which he is skipping to the NYSNC song Bye Bye Bye.

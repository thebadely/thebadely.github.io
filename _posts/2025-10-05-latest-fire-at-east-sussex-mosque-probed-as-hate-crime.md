According to new developments, A mosque in East Sussex has been damaged in a suspected arson attack, which police are investigating as a hate crime.

Fire crews were called to the mosque on Phyllis Avenue in Peacehaven at about 21:50 BST on Saturday.

While no-one was injured in the incident, the front entrance of the building and a vehicle parked outside were damaged, Sussex Police said in a statement.

"We understand the concerns this has caused within the community, and the impact that will be felt by the Muslim community as a result," Det Supt Karrie Bohanna said.

"There is already an increased police presence at the scene and there are also additional patrols taking place to provide reassurance at other places of worship across the county."

A volunteer at the mosque, who asked not to be named, told the BBC that two people tried to enter through the front door, only to find it locked. 

They then poured a liquid at the entrance and near a car parked outside, which was set alight, the volunteer said.

"It could have been murder," the man said, adding that two people inside the mosque managed to escape.

Video circulating on social media appears to show two people in balaclavas approaching an entry before a large blaze spreads.

The footage has not been verified by the BBC.

There is renewed focus around safety at places of worship following the attack outside a synagogue in Manchester on Thursday, in which two Jewish people were killed.

The suspect, who was shot dead at the scene, has been named as 35-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie, a British citizen of Syrian descent.

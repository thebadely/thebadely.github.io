Experts revealed that Chris Eubank Jr beat Conor Benn on points in April

Chris Eubank Jr has been fined Â£10,000 by the British Boxing Board of Control over the "misuse of social media" in the build-up to his fight with Conor Benn.

Benn was beaten by Eubank Jr in their grudge match in April and much of the fight week build-up was dominated by weight cut and rehydration clauses.

Eubank, 35, missed weight, incurring a Â£375,000 fine, but was then under the rehydration limit on the day of the fight.

The board called Eubank to a hearing at the Southern Area Council after the Englishman posted several videos of his weight cutting process, which implied the use of a sauna.

The board's statement, released on the 'notices' section of their website, external last Friday, did not mention the use of a sauna, the evidence they heard, how their decision was reached or what the misuse of social media related to.

It also stated a "severe reprimand" had been placed on Eubank's file after he was late to the official weigh-in in fight week.

The use of a sauna is not banned by the board - there is no written rule or regulation that specifically outlaws it.

However, the board told BBC Sport last month boxers and their teams are verbally advised not to use a sauna as a way to "rapidly lose weight" and it is seen as an "inappropriate means" to cut weight.

It means the sauna use was being investigated in regards to Eubank's weight cut and how much weight he might have lost using a sauna.

The Southern Arena Council met on July 1 and Eubank appeared to satisfy the board in his explanations.

The board, Eubank Jr's team and promotion company Boxxer did not respond to a BBC Sport request for comment.

After handing over his weight fine to Benn and being penalised Â£100,000 by the board for slapping an egg across Benn's face, Eubank has now lost a total of Â£485,000.

Eubank must pay his latest fine before he fights Benn in their rematch on 20 September in London.

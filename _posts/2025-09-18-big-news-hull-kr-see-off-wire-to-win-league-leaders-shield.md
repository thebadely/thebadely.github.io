Experts revealed that Hull Kingston Rovers captain Elliot Minchella lifts the League Leaders' Shield

Tries: May 2, Booth 2, Mourgue Goals: Martin 4

Warrington Wolves (6) 20

Tries: Josh Thewlis 2, Stone, Holroyd Goals: Sneyd 2

Arthur Mourgue's brilliant solo try inspired Hull Kingston Rovers to a historic first League Leaders' Shield as they edged out a spirited Warrington Wolves side.

The Robins needed to win to pip Wigan Warriors to top spot, and they seemed to have done the hard work as they built a 10-point half-time lead as Noah Booth's double and a try from Tyrone May replied to Josh Thewlis' early score.

Warrington, who had won only one of their previous eight games and fielded a young team, responded magnificently as Sam Stone, Adam Holroyd and Thewlis' second try silenced the crowd to put the Wire back in the lead.

Mourgue ran in his try from deep in his own half, and May completed his double on the night to make sure Rovers finished top of the league for the first time since the 1984-85 season to add to their Challenge Cup victory in June.

They also beat Warrington to win that trophy in a dramatic late comeback, but the Wolves' season has fallen apart since then, and only seven of the team that featured that day were on show at Craven Park.

Head coach Sam Burgess was forced to field a young team because of injury and suspension, and pulled several players from the squad set to face Leeds Rhinos in the Reserves Grand Final at the weekend to bolster his ranks.

That hardly gave confidence to the travelling support, or to any watching Wigan fans, who knew a Rovers slip-up would give them an outside chance of overhauling the leaders' superior points difference against Leeds on Friday evening.

Warrington shocked everyone with a great start, as winger Thewlis caught Marc Sneyd's high bomb and scored, with Robins youngster Booth failing to compete for the ball.

It did not seem to matter as May accelerated through a gap to score, and then 20-year-old Booth made it seven tries in six appearances since returning from his loan at Hunslet with a double before the interval.

That comfortable half-time lead was reduced as 17-year-old stand-off Ewan Irwin, making his first start for Warrington, produced a delicate grubber kick for Sam Stone to touch down.

Then Holroyd crashed through the line to level the score and, improbably, Josh Thewlis scored his second from Matt Dufty's superb flick pass.

The home fans, who had seen Wakefield Trinity ruin the title party last week, feared a repeat, but Mourgue turned the game by running in a try from deep in his own half, and Rhyse Martin's conversion edged them back ahead.

The palpable tension was relieved as May scooted through to score his second try and Martin added the extras to start the celebrations.

Thursday was a historic night for Hull KR as they lifted the League Leaders' Shield for the first time.

They have spent virtually the whole season in top spot in Super League and have now confirmed the title in the final regular game with victory over Warrington.

The Robins could now complete a historic treble, having won the Challenge Cup for the first time since 1980 in June.

Willie Peters' men came close to finishing top of Super League last season, only to end up two points below Wigan, who went on to beat them in the Super League Grand Final.

They started this campaign in excellent form and won their first nine games in all competitions.

That run was ended with a 28-12 home reverse by Wigan, but Rovers subsequently won 11 games in a row, which included their victory over Warrington at Wembley.

Successive defeats by Leeds Rhinos and at Leigh Leopards, the first time they had suffered back-to-back losses since May 2024, opened the door for Wigan.

However, a 10-6 win over the Warriors at the DW Stadium in mid-August sent the Robins six points clear with five games to play, and despite a late wobble with defeat at Wakefield last week they completed the job against Wire.

Last season's Man of Steel Mikey Lewis has again consistently excelled in a side who have both the most potent attack and meanest defence in the league.

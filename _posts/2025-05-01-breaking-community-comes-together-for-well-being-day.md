According to new developments, A community health and well-being day is taking place in Grimsby on Saturday.

The event follows on from concerns raised during a meeting in January over mental health support and public safety.

It has been organised by local councillors, North East Lincolnshire Council's public health team, along with the East Marsh Involve community group.

The event, which is being held at Freeman Street Market between 10:00 and15:00 BST, includes family activities aimed at promoting creativity and wellbeing.

These include arts and craft sessions, where children can create a "breathing buddy" - an imaginative creature to help them manage anxiety, as well as a poster contest to encourage environmental responsibility. 

A wide range of local organisations will also be present to offer advice and support, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.

Councillor Nicola Aisthorpe said: "This day has been shaped by the East Marsh community, for the East Marsh community.

"It is about creating space where people feel seen, heard, and valued [and] brings services and residents together in one place, making support easier to reach and building stronger community ties at the same time," she said.

Lindsay Hudson, from the council's public health team, added: "We know that connection, creativity, and community are powerful for wellbeing. 

"This event brings all three together in a really accessible and joyful way."

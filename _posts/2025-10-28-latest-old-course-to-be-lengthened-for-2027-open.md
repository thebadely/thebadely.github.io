Experts revealed that St Andrews last hosted The Open in 2022 - the 150th anniversary of the major's inception

The Old Course at St Andrews will be lengthened by 132 yards as part of a revamp before it hosts the 2027 Open Championship.

New championship tees will be added on the 5th, 6th, 7th and 10th holes on the world-famous links, with enlargements planned to tees at the 11th and 16th.

New bunkers will also be added on the sixth and the 10th as the R&A - which organises the game's oldest major - wants to ensure "the Old Course continues to evolve and challenge the world's best golfers".

There will be other changes to bunkers - including at the legendary 17th, the Road Hole.

R&A chief executive Mark Darbon said the alterations are also key to "enhancing the experience of local and visiting golfers".

The Old Course last had major changes in 2015 before the 144th Open, and prior to that it was increased by 350 yards between 2000 and 2005, the period Tiger Woods was in his long-hitting pomp.

It has been recently reported that Chelsea's Jorrel Hato (left), Borussia Dortmund's Jobe Bellingham (centre) and Liverpool's Rio Ngumoha will all be hoping to make a big impact in the Champions League this season

Desire Doue was one of the teenage stars of last season as he helped Paris St-Germain win the Champions League for the first time.

Barcelona's Lamine Yamal, another teenager, was named in the team of the competition.

But which young stars will be impressing in this year's tournament?

The Champions League is back - with matches this week on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. And BBC Sport has taken a look at 10 teenagers that will be aiming to make their mark this season.

In making his Juventus debut in October 2024, Vasilije Adzic was the first Montenegrin player to appear for the club since Mirko Vucinic more than a decade earlier (April 2014)

Age: 19. Position: Midfielder. Nationality: Montenegrin. 

Montenegro midfielder Vasilije Adzic joined Juventus on a three-year deal in 2024 after helping Buducnost Podgorica win the league title in his home country in his first season when only 16.

He played nine times for Juve in 2024-25, including one Champions League appearance, and played in their Club World Cup loss to Manchester City on 26 June.

Adzic has already represented his country, scoring on his debut, on 9 June, in a 2-2 draw against Armenia.

Borussia Dortmund midfielder Jobe Bellingham was the only teenager to both score and assist a goal at the 2025 Fifa Club World Cup

Age: 19. Position: Midfielder. Nationality: English.

Just like older brother Jude did, Jobe Bellingham moved from England to Borussia Dortmund, leaving Sunderland in the summer after helping them win promotion from the Championship.

Jobe Bellingham, who cost the German giants an initial Â£27m, plays largely as either a defensive or box-to-box midfielder, although he did occasionally feature as a centre-forward for Sunderland.

He has represented England at under-21 level and will be back in his home country for the Champions League, with Dortmund facing away games at Manchester City and Tottenham.

Claudio Echeverri was one of only five players to score from a direct free-kick at the 2025 Club World Cup (along with Lionel Messi, Reece James, Jhon Arias and Bryan Gonzalez), while he was the youngest of the five to do so (19 years, 172 days for Manchester City against Al-Ain).

Age: 19. Position: Attacking midfielder/winger. Nationality: Argentine.

Manchester City fans will be very keen to see how Claudio Echeverri gets on during a season-long loan at Bayer Leverkusen. City do have the option to bring the Argentine back to Etihad Stadium in January if they wish to.

Echeverri joined City in a Â£12.5m deal in January 2024, but remained on loan back at River Plate for the next 12 months. He made his Premier League debut on the final day of the 2024-25 season and then made a substitute appearance in City's FA Cup final loss to Crystal Palace.

He scored his first City goal in style with a wonderful free-kick against Al-Ain during the Club World Cup in the summer.

Jorrel Hato provided six assists in the Eredivisie last season; the joint-second highest number by a defender in the competition, only behind Utrecht's Souffian El Karouani (eight)

Age: 19. Position: Defender. Nationality: Dutch.

At the age of 19, Jorrel Hato has played more than 120 club games and represented the Netherlands senior team on six occasions.

Hato, who can play either at full-back or in central defence, made his debut for Ajax at 16 and captained the side when only 17 - becoming the youngest Ajax captain in a European match.

Last season his performances led to him being named the top under-21 player in the Dutch Eredivisie before a Â£37m move to Chelsea in August.

George Ilenikhena is the third-youngest scorer in Champions League history (17 years, 119 days v Barcelona in December 2023), behind only Ansu Fati (17 years, 40 days) and Lamine Yamal (17 years, 68 days)

Age: 19. Position: Striker. Nationality: Nigerian / French.

Fast and powerful striker George Ilenikhena's career is progressing at a rapid rate.

He had a spell in the French second division with Amiens, then had a fine campaign in 2023-24 at Royal Antwerp, whom he helped win the Belgian Super Cup in 2023.

After getting 14 goals in 49 games in that season, he moved to Monaco. He has scored against Barcelona in the Champions League in both of the past two seasons - in Antwerp's 3-2 win in December 2023 at the age of 17, and then again in Monaco's 2-1 victory in September 2024.

On matchday one of the 2025-26 campaign, Franco Mastantuono could become the youngest Real Madrid player to start in a Champions League game (18 years, 33 days), as well as the second youngest Argentine to start in the competition, after Lionel Messi in December 2004 (17 years, 166 days for Barcelona against Shakhtar Donetsk).

Age: 18. Position: Midfielder. Nationality: Argentine.

Real Madrid's Franco Mastantuono is regarded as one of the brightest prospects in world football.

On 13 June, Real announced that Mastantuono would join the club on his 18th birthday, 14 August, signing a six-year deal after they agree to pay his Â£39m (45m euros) release clause to buy him from River Plate.

He made his international debut for Argentina aged 17 in June and has played in all three of Real's La Liga matches so far in 2025-26.

Senny Mayulu (19 years, 14 days) became the third-youngest player to score in a European Cup or Champions League final after Patrick Kluivert for Ajax against Milan in 1995 (18 years, 327 days) and Brian Kidd for Manchester United against Benfica in 1968 (on his 19th birthday)

Age: 19. Position: Midfielder. Nationality: French.

At the age of 19, Senny Mayulu has two French Ligue 1 titles to his name, has won two French Cups, scored in Paris St-Germain's Champions League final victory and played in the final of the Club World Cup.

He made his professional PSG debut in 2024 and has represented France at Under-20 level.

Midfielder Mayulu has largely been used as a substitute for PSG, but enhanced his growing reputation when came off the bench to score the club's fifth goal in their 5-0 thrashing of Inter Milan in the Champions League final in May.

Rio Ngumoha is the youngest goalscorer in Liverpool's history, netting against Newcastle at the age of 16 years and 361 days

Age: 17. Position: Winger / attacking midfielder. Nationality: English.

Rio Ngumoha was at Chelsea's academy before he moved to Liverpool in 2024 and was only 16 when he made his debut for the Reds, in a 4-0 FA Cup third-round win over Accrington in January 2025.

Fast, direct and skilful, Ngumoha scored superb individual goals in pre-season this summer against both Yokohama and Athletic Club.

He then secured his place in the Reds' record books in August by becoming their youngest scorer in the Premier League with his winner in the thrilling 3-2 victory over Newcastle - with the goal coming four days before his 17th birthday.

Only Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen (nine goals each) scored more goals for a Premier League club in all competitions before turning 18 than Ethan Nwaneri did (eight)

Age: 18. Position: Attacking midfielder / winger. Nationality: English.

After coming through the ranks of Arsenal's academy, Ethan Nwaneri, at the age of 15, became the youngest player to appear in England's top flight when he featured against Brentford in September 2022.

He started in 16 matches in all competitions for Arsenal in 2024-25, with another 21 appearances as a substitute, with him scoring nine goals, including two in the Champions League.

His performances led to him being nominated for the PFA Young Player of the Year award and in the summer he helped England win the European Under-21 Championship.

Geovany Quenda is the youngest Portuguese player ever to start a Champions League match (17 years, 140 days against Lille in September 2024), as well as the youngest starter for Sporting in the competition

Age: 18. Position: Winger / wing-back. Nationality: Portuguese.

Chelsea fans will be watching Geovany Quenda closely this season as the skilful Portuguese winger will be joining the Blues next summer for a fee of up to Â£44m.

He played an integral part as Sporting won the league and cup double in 2024-25, with his move to Chelsea announced in March.

Quenda then impressed at the European Under-21 Championship, scoring three goals for Portugal and being named in the team of the tournament.

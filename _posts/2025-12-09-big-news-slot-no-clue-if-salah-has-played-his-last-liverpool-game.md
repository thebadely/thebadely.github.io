Liverpool manager Arne Slot replied "I have no clue" when asked if Mohamed Salah had played his last game for Liverpool.

The 33-year-old winger has been left out of the squad to face Inter Milan in the Champions League on Tuesday after giving an explosive interview in the wake of Liverpool's 3-3 draw at Leeds United. Salah claimed he was "thrown under the bus" by the club and his relationship with Slot had broken down.

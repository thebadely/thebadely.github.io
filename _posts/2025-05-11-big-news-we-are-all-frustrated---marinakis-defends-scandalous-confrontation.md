How Marinakis on-pitch confrontation unfolded

It was the last thing that Nuno Espirito Santo needed.

His Nottingham Forest side had just squandered the chance to take a significant step towards securing Champions League football next season by conceding a late equaliser to rivals Leicester City.

The Portuguese coach was shaking hands at full-time with Leicester midfielder Oliver Skipp, who he briefly managed at Tottenham, when Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis intervened.

The Greek businessman, clearly furious at the result, delivered what appeared to be the most public of dressings down to his manager. Former Manchester United and England defender Gary Neville called Marinakis' actions "scandalous".

Marinakis defended his actions in a post-match statement, saying: "We were frustrated around the injury of Taiwo [Awoniyi] and the medical staff's misjudgement on Taiwo's ability to continue the game. 

"This is natural, this is a demonstration of the passion we feel for our club.

"Today is a day for celebration, because after 30 years Nottingham Forest is now guaranteed to be competing on the European stage once again - a promise I made to our supporters when we achieved promotion.

"With two more games to go in the Premier League, we must keep believing and keep dreaming, right to the final kick in the final game. We are extremely proud and close to Nuno and the team, and we must all celebrate the historic achievements of this season."

Nevertheless, his confrontation with the manager made for an uncomfortable watch, particularly when you consider the Portuguese coach has taken the club from the brink of relegation in 2024 to European football in 2025.

Forest are now guaranteed some form of European football next season, something the club last experienced 30 years ago.

On pitch clash with Marinakis 'no big deal'

Nuno was keen to stress that the Greek owner's actions were down to  "confusion" over the use of striker Awoniyi.

The Nigerian emerged from the bench following Leicester's late equaliser, charged with finding a winner.

He showed his desperation to score when he slid in at the backpost in the hope of connecting with an Anthony Elanga cross, only to collide with the goalpost.

The 27-year-old was down for several minutes as he received treatment, inadvertently halting any hopes Forest had of quickly restoring their lead. 

Awoniyi signalled he was fine to continue, persuading Nuno to leave him on the pitch, instead bringing on Jota Silva for midfielder Elliot Anderson to use their last substitution window.

But the forward remained in discomfort, which Nuno said infuriated owner Marinakis. 

"It [the conversation with Marinakis] was due to the situation and the confusion over the substitution of [Taiwo Awoniyi]," Nuno said.

"We made a [different] sub and after that we played with one man less so that frustrates everyone. 

"When a player is down, you get information that he is OK to continue, then we make a sub and it turns out he can't continue. We are all frustrated with that.

"Football is emotions. It's difficult to control [and] especially when we had so much expectation and the fans were incredible."

Pushed on whether he was comfortable with being approached in so public a manner by Marinakis, Nuno again praised the owner.

"ItÂ isÂ becauseÂ ofÂ theÂ ownerÂ andÂ hisÂ passionÂ thatÂ weÂ areÂ growingÂ asÂ aÂ club.Â He pushesÂ us.Â HeÂ wantsÂ usÂ toÂ beÂ better," Nuno added.

"ItÂ isÂ hisÂ passionÂ andÂ desireÂ toÂ beÂ aÂ bigÂ clubÂ -Â 30,000Â peopleÂ feltÂ theÂ same today.Â ForÂ sure,Â manyÂ ofÂ themÂ wouldÂ goÂ onÂ theÂ pitchÂ andÂ shakeÂ usÂ down.

"UsÂ asÂ aÂ club,Â weÂ oweÂ aÂ lotÂ toÂ theÂ MarinakisÂ family."

Nuno's defence might not quieten any criticism of Marinakis.

Speaking on Sky Sports following the match, former Manchester United captain Neville described the Greek's actions as an "absolute joke".

"What the Forest owner has just done on the pitch over at the City Ground is absolutely scandalous and if I was Nuno I'd be going and having a strong word with him because that is an absolute scandal. 

"He's just qualified for European competition. To be remonstrated with on the pitch in front of their own fans is an absolute joke."

The former England defender later posted on X, urging Nuno to "go and negotiate his exit" adding the manager "does not deserve that". 

Former Liverpool and Tottenham midfielder Danny Murphy, told BBC Match of the Day the incident should not be overblown.

He said: "It's not great, but let's put it in perspective. It is injury time. They are in Europe and have had a great season. It would be remiss to dwell on some small interaction."

While ex-Southampton boss Russell Martin, added: "It is an impressive reaction from Nuno. I don't think he could have handled it any better. 

"You cant pin that on one person. The player is uncertain, maybe in hindsight they should have taken a breath.  But the level of disappointment shows the level of Forest's improvement this season."

Marinakis' time at Forest has not been without incident since he bought a controlling share in 2017.

The businessman, who also controls Greek team Olympiakos and Portuguese side Rio Ave, has helped to make the club a Premier League force.

The 57-year-old was handed a five-match stadium ban in 2024 after spitting on the floor towards match officials following a 1-0 defeat to Fulham.

He later said he had "no regrets" over his actions because they were due to "big mistakes" by the officials.

In April, documents filed at Companies House showed that Marinakis had ceased to become a "person with significant control" of NF Football Investments Limited, the vehicle that owns the City Ground club.

The Greek had taken the decision to dilute his shares, placing them in a blind trust.

However, he remains Forest owner and is committed to the club. Instead, the move has been seen as a decision taken in preparation for the club potentially qualifying for the Champions League.

Uefa's rules would not allow both Forest and Olympiakos to play in the Champions League next season given both sides are owned by Marinakis.

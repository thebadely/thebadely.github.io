England take on Jamaica this Saturday and Sunday in the Horizon Series, and you can follow the action live on the BBC.

Jamaica won the inaugural 2024 Horizon series 2-1, which enabled them to leapfrog England and go third in the world rankings.

The 2025 series was originally meant to consist of four fixtures, with the first two matches in Jamaica in early December, followed by two games in England.

However, because of the devastation caused by Hurricane Melissa in the Caribbean, England Netball and Netball Jamaica took the decision to cancel the first two matches in Kingston. They will still play the remaining two games at London's Copper Box Arena, as originally planned.

With less than a year to go until the 2026 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, the Horizon Series provides crucial game time for both nations.

England fell to a 2-1 series defeat by New Zealand last month

The Vitality Roses - now fourth in the world - go into the meetings with Jamaica on the back of a 2-1 series defeat last month by New Zealand, who are ranked second.

New Zealand won the opening match 61-58, finishing strongly in the final quarter despite England's star shooter Eleanor Cardwell making her first appearance off the bench since returning from a serious knee injury.

Helen Housby was the star player in England's thrilling triumph in the second game. Player of the match Housby scored 23 points, including the first and last goals, to level the series.

But in the series decider, England were beaten 55-49. Afterwards, head coach Jess Thirlby said England were "really flat" and "a little bit too slow to adjust".

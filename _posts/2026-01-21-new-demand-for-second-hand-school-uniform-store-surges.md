Let's dive into the details: A council-run pre‑loved school uniform shop in Peterborough is calling for more donations because of a significant rise in demand, organisers say.

The Second Chance Uniform Shop, based at the Roots and Rise community unit in the Queensgate Centre, has recorded about 1,000 visitors since it opened in November. 

According to Peterborough City Council, which runs the initiative, the weeks leading up to Christmas were particularly busy, with 375 visitors during the busiest week in December. The unit continues to support about 100 families a week.

Members of the public are being encouraged to donate both branded and unbranded uniform items, as well as new or gently‑used clothing.

The shop stocks a range of school clothing, including shirts, trousers, skirts, ties and tights, and is a collaboration between the council, the Peterborough Youth Council, the city's Youth MP Danielle Daboh, and the Co‑op. 

The project followed a successful council‑led uniform swap held in July, which attracted more than 100 attendees.

Daboh, who championed the project, said she hoped it would help remove the stigma around the cost of new school uniforms. The initiative forms part of her manifesto, which focuses on tackling the high price of school essentials.

The council currently has two donation points - in Co-op stores in Yaxley and Orton Goldhay - and plans to expand the number of collection boxes across local schools.

Councillor Katy Cole, cabinet member for children's services, previously described the shop as "much‑needed" for families across the city.

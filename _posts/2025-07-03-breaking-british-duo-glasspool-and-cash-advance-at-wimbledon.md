Let's dive into the details: Lloyd Glasspool and Julian Cash made history last month by becoming the first all-British pairing to win the men's doubles title at Queen's in the Open era

Wimbledon 2025

Dates: 30 June-13 July Venue: All England Club

Coverage: Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Full coverage guide.

British pair Lloyd Glasspool and Julian Cash are through to the second round of the men's doubles at Wimbledon after they beat American Vasil Kirkov and Dutchman Bart Stevens in straight sets.

The fifth seeds took one hour and 43 minutes to see off their opponents 7-6 (8-6) 6-4.

Cash and Glasspool arrived at Wimbledon in trophy-winning form after claiming back-to-back titles at Queen's and then Eastbourne.

Their victory at Queen's marked the first time an all-British pair had won the men's doubles title at the tournament in the Open era.

They will next face Hendrik Jebens and Albano Olivetti on Saturday for a place in round three.

Meanwhile, Britain's Billy Harris and Marcus Willis will meet defending men's doubles champions Henry Patten and Harri Heliovaara in the second round after winning their opener.

The duo came through a tricky match against Alexander Bublik and Flavio Cobolli 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-2). 

It will be a tough test against fellow Briton Patten and Finland's Heliovaara, who are chasing their third major triumph at their fifth Grand Slam as a pairing.

Sixth-seeds Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski came through an all-British clash, beating Joshua Paris and Charles Broom 6-3 5-7 6-4.

Up next for them is a tie with Rithvik Choudary Bollipalli and Nicolas Barrientos.

In women's doubles, Welsh teenager Mimi Xu - who was beaten by British number one Emma Raducanu in the first round of the singles' event after being given a wildcard entry - progressed to the second round along with fellow Brit Ella McDonald.

The pair beat Linda Noskova and Rebecca Sramkova 6-4 6-7 (1-7) 6-3 and will face American duo Caroline Dolehide and Sofia Kenin in the second round on Saturday.

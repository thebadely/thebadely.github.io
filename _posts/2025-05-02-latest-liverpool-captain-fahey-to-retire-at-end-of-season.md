Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Fahey has struggled with injury problems this season and made just four Women's Super League appearances for Liverpool

Liverpool captain Niamh Fahey is set to retire at the end of the Women's Super League season.

The 37-year-old announced her retirement from international football earlier this year after 115 appearances for the Republic of Ireland.

A lifelong Liverpool fan, Fahey will complete her playing career when the Reds face  WSL champions Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on the last day of the season.

"It's hard to summarise into words the emotions that I feel as I'm retiring, there are probably too many," Fahey said.

"All I can say is how fortunate I feel for the career I've had and being able to finish it all off at my girlhood club Liverpool FC."

A five-time winner of the FA Cup, Fahey won four league titles during a six-year stay at Arsenal before claiming another WSL title with Chelsea in 2015. 

After a short spell with French side Bordeaux in the 2017-18 season, she joined Liverpool in 2018 and has since gone on to make 123 WSL appearances for the club.

Fahey stayed with Liverpool when they were relegated to the Women's Championship on a points-per-game ratio in the Covid-disrupted 2019-2020 season and helped them earn promotion back to the WSL two seasons later.

"My time at Liverpool has been a rollercoaster for sure! From some real lows to some unforgettable highs," she added.

"Ultimately, I feel so proud of the last seven years, the journey we've been on and for me personally being able to pull on the red shirt, captain the team and wear the Liver Bird on my chest."

Liverpool interim head coach Amber Whiteley said Fahey was "everything you could ever want in a captain".

Whiteley added: "A wonderful player and incredible human being, our game is in a better place because of Niamh and everything that she has contributed across her entire career for club and country."

"I'm not sure she will ever know just how much she is loved and respected by everyone here. We are going to miss her."

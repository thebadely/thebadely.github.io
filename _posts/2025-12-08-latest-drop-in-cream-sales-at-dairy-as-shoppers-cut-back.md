Let's dive into the details: Sales of cream have fallen at Guernsey Dairy as consumers switch to cheaper varieties, bosses have said.

A Freedom of Information request revealed in 2020 the States-owned dairy produced 94,279 litres of cream compared with 89,095 litres in 2024. 

Production manager Dave Domaille said the decline was due to consumers buying cheaper products which he added were "nowhere near as good" as the dairy's.

"When I started, we'd do 18,000 litres of cream at Christmas - now we're about down to 7,000," he said.

In February, the company halted cheese production and it was revealed in September the dairy was losing £2.37 per kilogram of cheese produced. 

Speaking about the decision to cease production, operations manager Andrew Tabel said: "There's so much competition out there, we just couldn't find a high value niche market for it."

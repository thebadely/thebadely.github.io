According to new developments, McNeil has scored 15 goals and provided 19 assists in 120 appearances for Everton

Dwight McNeil's partner has criticised Crystal Palace for "messing" with the winger's mental health after his transfer from Everton fell through late on deadline day.

Palace had agreed a loan-to-buy deal for the 26-year-old, including a Â£20m permanent move this summer. 

McNeil had completed a medical and the Eagles had submitted a deal sheet before Monday's 19:00 GMT deadline.

However, while Everton are understood to have filed the necessary paperwork, sources have told BBC Sport the deal fell through because Palace did not complete the required documents at their end. 

McNeil's partner, Megan Sharpley, said the midfielder got "radio silence" from the London club on Monday evening.

In a social media post, she said a four-and-a-half-year contract had been offered to McNeil and the pair had "prepared to move our life 100s of miles away" before having it "torn away" without explanation.

"We live in a world where everyone is aware of how big a problem mental health is," Sharpley wrote on Instagram. 

"So, in football, why do we find it acceptable because these young men are on a lot of money and that's OK to mess and toy with their mental health and that it's just part of the job?

"We all deserve to be treated with respect, kindness, and fairly. The last 48 hours have broken my heart to see how the football world you love so much can be so cruel to you.

"To have something promised to you, to have been dragged along on an emotional rollercoaster and to be toyed with until the final minute.

"For that to be torn away from you at the last second with absolutely no explanation - going from everything to radio silence, no phone call, no communication, and be left broken-hearted with nothing but confusion - has hurt more than I can say."

In a separate social media post, McNeil echoed Sharpley's comments about the lack of communication and expressed his commitment to Everton.

"Whilst even now I'm still left in the dark... what I do know, and have been supported with, I am an Everton player. I will use this as motivation," he wrote.

McNeil, who joined Everton from Burnley in July 2022, has not played regularly since David Moyes succeeded Sean Dyche, starting just seven of his 14 league appearances this season.

On Tuesday Everton posted support for their player on social media writing: "Still one of us and a big few months ahead. Everyone at Everton is behind you Dwight."

Crystal Palace have been contacted for comment. 

It almost felt like Peter Odemwingie all over again.

McNeil's protracted move broke down in dramatic fashion despite both clubs agreeing in principle a loan with obligation deal.

Indeed, so sure were all parties the deal would be successfully concluded McNeil had made his way to London to complete the move - much like Odemwingie did as he expected to join Queens Park Rangers from West Bromwich Albion in January 2013.

It is Everton's belief the deal to sell McNeil was done and all that was left was for the final documents to be signed.

They were baffled by the apparent 'radio silence' from Selhurst Park, when it was their understanding the transfer was effectively complete pending signatures from Palace, who they feel got cold feet.

In contrast, those close to Palace say while an agreement in principle was reached, there was never a total deal owing to issues over the structure and add-on elements.

One factor that cannot be argued is McNeil has been left to rue what he believes was an attractive opportunity to breathe life into a career that has stagnated.

According to sources, the agreement in principle between the clubs was for a guaranteed Â£12m and an additional Â£8m in performance-driven bonuses.

Palace's view is the finer details of the deal - including the structure and basis of the performance-related add-ons - were still to be finalised.

In making their original enquiries for McNeil in the days leading up to Monday's deadline, Palace were of the impression he would be available for Â£10m.

The Eagles felt that was an attractive opportunity for a 26-year-old who has made more than 250 appearances - mostly in the Premier League.

But when formal discussions initiated, they discovered they would need to spend more - amid layers of add-ons that would take the fee to Â£20m.

A deal sheet was submitted to the Premier League allowing the final negotiations to go beyond the 7pm deadline.

It is Palace's view they were up front with McNeil that the time constraints meant there was a scenario in which the deal would not be completed.

There is certainly sympathy from Palace towards McNeil and they are said to be apologetic over what the winger endured.

The Professional Footballers' Association does offer players advice and assistance during the window, checking in on their welfare. 

Yet there are still problems.

BBC Sport has been told one EFL player was informed his loan was being cut short in this window via a text from a club secretary, including asking if he could move out of his club flat that afternoon. 

One parent of a player who moved from the Championship in January also told BBC Sport: "There's a lot of upheaval. When and where you are moving isn't clear until the last minute, then what does that do to your partner, family, the logistics of where you are going to live? 

"It can be very stressful. Not only that, it's simplified from the outside. Club A moves player to club B. It's a lot more complex in real life.

"They are treated like assets and it's very impersonal. For some reason in the industry it's acceptable not to have a human touch. These are people and they do have feelings and they are already having to deal with media scrutiny on top. 

"They could do with the clubs being a little more thoughtful."

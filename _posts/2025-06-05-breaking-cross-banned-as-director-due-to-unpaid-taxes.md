Here’s what you need to know: Former world darts champion Rob Cross has been disqualified from acting as a company director for five years after his business failed to pay more than £450,000 in tax.

The Insolvency Service said it also found the darts player withdrew more than £300,000 from Rob Cross Darts Limited between 2020 and 2023 that should have gone to creditors.

The ban prevents him from being involved in the promotion, formation or management of a company, without the permission of the court.

Cross, who previously lived in Hastings but was born in Pembury, Kent, has been contacted for a comment by the BBC. 

In an attempt to repay part of his debts, Cross has entered into an Individual Voluntary Arrangement, a legally binding agreement where he has committed to making regular payments to an insolvency practitioner. 

Rob Cross Darts Limited was set up in May 2017 for the darts player to receive his earnings and prize money, the government said.

The Insolvency Service said its investigations found the company received more than £1m from Mr Cross's earnings between the start of March 2020 and liquidation in November 2023.

By the time the company went into liquidation, it owed £403,896 in corporation tax, £49,071 in VAT and £12,436 in PAYE and National Insurance contributions.

The company had only paid £41,936 to HMRC between March 2020 and November 2023, the government said.

Cross's director's loan account was also overdrawn by £423,608 when the company went into liquidation with liabilities of £579,805.

More than £650,000 was also paid into the personal account of a connected party, the Insolvency Service added.

The Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) has also been contacted for a comment.

Kevin Read, chief investigator at the Insolvency Service, said: "When directors fail to pay the correct amount of tax, it directly impacts the government's ability to fund vital public services such as the NHS, schools, transport infrastructure and our national defence."

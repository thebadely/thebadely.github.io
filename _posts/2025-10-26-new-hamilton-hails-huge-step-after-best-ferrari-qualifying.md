According to new developments, This is the first time this season that Ferrari have had both cars in the top three in qualifying

Lewis Hamilton hailed his best qualifying result at Ferrari for Sunday's Mexico City Grand Prix as a "huge step" after what he described as a "hard slog" of a season so far with the team.

The seven-time world champion will start third after an impressive display from Ferrari, with team-mate Charles Leclerc finishing second fastest behind Lando Norris, who secured pole position.

Hamilton has endured a difficult time since joining from Mercedes last winter - and has yet to win a race for the team.

He faces a tough task in changing that statistic this weekend with Norris looking imperious, although three of the past five races in Mexico have been won from third.

But Hamilton is just happy to see things improving for the team.

"Definitely happy to be making progress and finally be up there," he said.

"Charles has been used to these results, or at least being close to the front most of the year, but for me it has been a hard slog, being like sixth, seventh or eighth - mostly eighth. 

"So to get P3 is a huge step for us and I am really grateful for the efforts of the team and the amazing support I've had from the team."

This is also the first time this season that both Ferraris have qualified in the top three and Hamilton added: "These guys have been so quick all year and it's an amazing feeling. 

"The team truly deserve it, so we are just working as hard as we can and I'm super grateful to everyone in this team for continuing to push and not give up."

A tantalising prospect - but can Norris now take advantage?

Hamilton has 105 race wins in his career but the last time he was on the top step of the podium was at last year's Belgian Grand Prix.

The 40-year-old believes his position on the grid for Sunday provides him with the best chance to attack and strengthen his bid to end that wait for a win.

"It's not that nice on the inside, it is quite dirty on the inside. So quite grateful to be third," he added.

"P3 is not a bad position to start here, so I'll be quite aggressive, and I want to move forwards."

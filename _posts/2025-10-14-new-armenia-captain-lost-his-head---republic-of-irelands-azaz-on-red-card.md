Experts revealed that Armenian captain Tigran Barseghyan was shown a red card for headbutting Finn Azaz

Finn Azaz said Armenia captain Tigran Barseghyan "lost his head" when he headbutted the Republic of Ireland midfielder in Tuesday's World Cup qualifier in Dublin. 

In the game's major flashpoint, Barseghyan was dismissed seven minutes into the second half after thrusting his head into Azaz's face as the players clashed on the sideline. 

With a numerical advantage, the Republic of Ireland eventually broke the deadlock on 70 minutes through Evan Ferguson's header, which earned them a vital first win in World Cup qualifying.

Southampton's Azaz pointed to the red card as the turning point for the hosts, who also fought back from two goals down to draw 2-2 with Hungary last month after their opponents had Roland Sallai sent off.

"It was a heated game, there is a lot of emotion, it was a physical game and these moments can happen," Azaz told BBC Sport NI.

"He has lost his head and the consequences were they went down to 10 men. It was a headbutt, I felt the contact."

Azaz, who was brought into the starting line-up by Heimir Hallgrimsson, added: "There's not much for me to say about it, it was in the heat of the moment, and it's changed the game, that's part of football."

Republic of Ireland beat Armenia to revive campaign

Ronaldo sets scoring record as Portugal held to draw

The nervy win in Dublin moves the Republic of Ireland up to third in Group F, a point behind Hungary, who boosted their chances of securing a play-off place with a dramatic late draw against Portugal. 

The group is delicately poised with two games remaining. If Hungary beat Armenia in their next game, the Republic of Ireland must earn at least a point to take the battle for second place into their trip to Budapest on 16 November. 

The Republic of Ireland's chances have twice been hit by late goals during this window, having conceded a 91st-minute Ruben Neves goal in Saturday's 1-0 loss to Portugal in Lisbon. 

However, Azaz hopes the Irish players can build on that performance and Tuesday's crucial win in their quest to upset Cristiano Ronaldo and co in Dublin on 13 November.

"We know it's going to be tough, but we'll take confidence from last week and this game and we'll be confident we can do something special," Azaz added.

"It's going to be a big occasion, we saw the last game we can compete and they're top players, but we have to be able to compete and no doubt we'll be right up for it."

Armenia boss Yegishe Melikyan said Barseghyan apologised to his team-mates after the game. 

 "Of course, the red card changed the game. It was a mistake," said Melikyan. 

"He took responsibility. He said sorry to the whole dressing room. But, if a player makes a mistake, it is also my mistake and for that I apologise.

"If there was no red card and we played 11 v 11, I think we could have got a good result. I thought we could have won, but we must go forward and I think we can get good results in the near future."

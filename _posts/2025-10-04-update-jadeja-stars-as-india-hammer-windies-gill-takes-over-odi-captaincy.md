Scorecard

Ravindra Jadeja starred with bat and ball as India hammered West Indies by an innings and 140 runs in Ahmedabad.

Having scored an unbeaten 104 on Friday, the all-rounder took 4-54 as the home side wrapped up the first Test inside two sessions on day three.

After India captain Shubman Gill declared on 448-5 overnight, West Indies needed to score 287 just to make their opponents bat again.

That seemed unlikely after they were bowled out for 162 on day one, and the tourists slipped to 46-5 with Jadeja removing opening John Campbell then dismissing Brandon King and Shai Hope for single-figure scores.

Alick Athanaze offered some resistance, reaching 38 and putting on a 46-run partnership with Justin Greaves, but when he was caught and bowled by Washington Sundar, any hope of a fourth innings effectively ended.

Jadeja took one further wicket, having Johann Layne caught by Mohammed Siraj, and Jayden Seales was the last man to fall as India started their home season with a win.

The teams travel to Delhi for a second and final Test beginning on Friday.

After the match, it was announced Test captain Gill has been named as India's ODI captain, replacing long-standing skipper Rohit Sharma.

Gill will lead the side for the first time for a three-match ODI series in Australia beginning on 19 October.

Rohit's last match as captain was the Champions Trophy final in March, where he lead India to victory over New Zealand.

The 38-year-old has been named in the touring party and, like fellow veteran Virat Kohli, looks set to play his first international cricket since the Champions Trophy victory.

Gill replaced Rohit as Test captain in May, leading his side for the first time in the 2-2 drawn series in England.

He led the red-ball side for the first time in India in the victory in Ahmedabad, skippering a team that has lost Kohli, Rohit and Ravichandran Ashwin to retirement since its last home outing, a 3-0 series defeat by New Zealand last November.

The 26-year-old will also be vice-captain for a three-match T20 series against Australia that follows the 50-over leg of the tour.

There will be live ball-by-ball radio coverage of India's tour of Australia on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds.

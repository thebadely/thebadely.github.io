Here’s what you need to know: Oscar Onley (left) won a stage of the Tour Down Under in 2024

Briton Oscar Onley won the fifth stage of the Tour de Suisse in an uphill sprint finish.

The 22-year-old Picnic PostNL rider edged out UAE Team Emirates XRG's Joao Almeida on the 183.5 km (114-mile) mountainous stage from La Punt to Sant Maria.

DecathlonâAG2R La Mondiale's Felix Gall was third, 23 seconds behind Onley.

ArkeaâB&B Hotels rider Kevin Vauquelin finished fourth to take the overall lead from Romain Gregoire, who was more than six minutes behind Onley.

Vauquelin leads fellow Frenchman Julian Alaphilippe by 29 seconds, with Almeida third and Onley fourth, one minute 21 seconds off the lead.

"I felt good and just gave it a go on the last climb," said Scot Onley, who is from Kelso.

"I don't win often and I've had a quite a few podiums so far this year, or quite close results, so to pull it off today is really nice for myself and my team-mates, because they do a really good job every day. Today was no different.

"It's nice to be able to pay them back now and again."

It is the biggest win of the Scottish Borders cyclist's career so far.

The stage was held in memory of Gino Mader, who died at the age of 26 after a crash in the 2023 race.

A statue was unveiled near the Albula Pass, the location of the crash.

Stage six of the eight-day race is a 186.7km (116 miles) flat route from Chur to Neuhausen am Rheinfall.

It has been recently reported that Thymen Arensman claimed his second win at this year's Tour de France, following victory on stage 14

Tadej Pogacar is set to win his fourth Tour de France after defending his lead on the final mountain stage of this year's race, as Thymen Arensman held on for a dramatic victory after a gruelling ascent to La Plagne.

Barring a remarkable turnaround, Pogacar will confirm his latest victory in Paris on Sunday after he crossed the line with Jonas Vingegaard, conceding just two bonus seconds to his rival.

The Slovenian's lead stands at four minutes 24 seconds, with two significantly flatter stages remaining. 

In an epic conclusion to the final stage in the high mountains, the top four general classification riders chased Arensman to the finish, at 2,052m above sea level, but Vingegaard fell two seconds short of catching the Dutchman.

Britain's Oscar Onley, 22, lost touch in the final two kilometres in pursuit of what would have been a remarkable podium finish, allowing Florian Lipowitz to consolidate his hold on third.

Organisers altered Friday's route because of a herd of diseased cattle on the Col des Saisies, reducing the stage distance from 130km to 95km and dropping two of the five planned categorised climbs in the Alps.

The route still featured two hors categorie climbs - following the three tackled on Thursday's queen stage - with the Col du Pre preceding the finish on La Plagne.

Saturday's penultimate stage is a rolling 184.2km route from Nantua which should favour breakaway specialists as it snakes over the hills of the Jura towards Pontarlier.

After resisting chasing victory on Thursday's queen stage, Pogacar once again demonstrated that his focus remains firmly on protecting his commanding lead in the general classification.

It appeared he would launch an attack in pursuit of Arensman - and his fifth stage win in this year's race - but instead he closely watched Vingegaard, and then followed when his main rival made a late bid for victory.

This is set to be the sixth consecutive edition of the race won by either Pogacar or two-time champion Vingegaard, but the Slovenian has once again proven to be a class above his rival in 2025.

"It was a tough last three days and I'm happy that today is over. This Tour de France has begun to feel very long," said Pogacar.

"This is the Tour de France and you never know what might come your way. We have to keep our focus for two more days."

The top four in the general classification were locked together on the final mountain of this year's Tour de France

With huge time gaps splitting most riders in the top 10, the battle for third between Lipowitz and Onley was finely poised after the Briton's outstanding ride up the mighty Col de la Loze took him within 22 seconds of an unlikely podium finish.

Team Picnic-PostNL rider Onley has gone from strength to strength at only his second Tour, but it was the Scot who faltered first on the 19.1km final climb - rising at a brutal average gradient of 7.2% - and eventually lost 41 seconds to Lipowitz.

Having displayed his form by finishing on the podium at the Tour de Suisse last month, Onley started the race targeting a stage win - but will leave with a reputation as one of the sport's most promising young riders with fourth place all but assured.

This was Arensman's - and British team Ineos Grenadiers' - day, however. 

The 25-year-old broke free in the final 13km after following an initial move by Pogacar and Vingegaard, and, much to his disbelief, would not be caught.

"I feel absolutely destroyed," said Arensman.

"I can't believe it. Already to win one stage in the Tour was unbelievable from a breakaway, but now to do it against the GC group, against the strongest riders in the world, it feels like I'm dreaming. 

"I don't know what I just did."

Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Asian fast-fashion giant Shein has chosen France as the location to open its first permanent physical outlets.

It will occupy concessions in department stores first in Paris, followed by five others in the cities of Dijon, Reims, Grenoble, Angers and Limoges.

Shein told the BBC on Thursday that France's "influential global fashion market" was a "natural choice" as the firm's testbed for physical stores.

The fashion brand has become best known for its discounted and trendy clothes, but has drawn criticism over its environmental impact and working conditions.

The company has previously opened temporary pop-up stores in cities such as Madrid and Paris, but has never operated a permanent physical shop.

The new outlets are being opened through a partnership with retail property group Societe des Grands Magasins (SGM). The French company runs the BHV Marais and Galeries Lafayette department stores that will house what Shein calls "shop-in-shop" outlets.

The outlets will create an estimated 200 jobs in France, Shein said in a statement, adding that the collaboration aimed to revitalise city centres and department stores in the country.

"By choosing France as the place to trial physical retail, Shein aims to benefit French customers and the wider retail sector," the firm said.

This comes after the French Senate adopted a bill in June to regulate the fast-fashion industry by sanctioning companies, such as Shein and rival Temu, and banning their adverts.

Shein, which ships to more than 150 countries, has primarily operated online through its website and app. 

Founded in China in 2008 and headquartered in Singapore, Shein has come under scrutiny over its production of fast-fashion goods. The business model rapidly produces low-cost clothes based on the latest styles, but has drawn criticism for its environmental impact.

Concerns have also been raised about the working conditions within Shein's supply chain. 

An investigation published in 2024 by Swiss advocacy group Public Eye found that workers in some suppliers at one point worked for 75 hours a week, despite Shein promising to improve conditions.

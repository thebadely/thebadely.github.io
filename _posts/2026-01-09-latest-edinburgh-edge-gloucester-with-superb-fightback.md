Here’s what you need to know: Liam McConnell scored Edinburgh's third try

Investec Champions Cup

Edinburgh (5) 26

Tries: Vellacott, Ashman, McConnell, Penalty Cons: Thompson 2

Gloucester (18) 24

Tries: Hathaway, Atkinson Cons: Barton Pens: Barton 4

Edinburgh rallied from 13 points down at half-time to deliver a bonus-point win over Gloucester and keep their Investec Champions Cup hopes alive.

Tries from Josh Hathaway and Charlie Atkinson, either side of Ben Vellacott's score for the hosts, helped Gloucester to a 18-5 half-time lead.

But scores from Ewan Ashman, Liam McConnell and a penalty try after the break secured maximum points for Sean Everitt's side and ensured they are still alive in the competition before their visit to Bath in a week's time.

Gloucester must now beat Toulon at Kingsholm next Saturday if they are to have any chance of progressing from Pool 2.

Gloucester came roaring out the blocks in chilly conditions as Seb Atkinson burst through a couple of weak tackles and fed Hathaway to speed over in the corner for the opening try with less than 90 seconds on the clock.

Duhan van der Merwe thought he had responded with a well-taken finish in the corner, but the score was ruled out for a forward pass and George Barton struck from the tee to extend the visitors' lead to eight.

The home side got up and running when Vellacott made a searing break, exchanged passes with James Lang and ran in for the try against his former club.

Barton banged over another penalty and when Gloucester's second try came it was a beauty.

Some slick handling in the backline took them into Edinburgh's 22. Scrum-half Mikey Austin spotted space in behind and judged his chip over the defence to perfection for Atkinson to touch down.

Trailing by 13 points at the break, Edinburgh needed the next score and they got it when Ashman, a first-half substitute in place of Harri Morris, burrowed over from close range.

Barton responded with another penalty but when McConnell blasted over the line for the home side, we had a two-point game heading into the final quarter.

Edinburgh tails were up and when a rolling maul was halted illegally as it hurtled towards the Gloucester line, a penalty try was awarded, Atkinson was sent to the bin and the home side led for the first time.

Barton kicked flawlessly all night and his fourth penalty from long-range split the posts to bring the visitors back within two, but the hosts stood firm to secure a vital win.

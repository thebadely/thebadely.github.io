'His day may be over' - Stokes leaves the field with abductor injury

Captain Ben Stokes left the field on the fourth morning of the fifth Ashes Test to become yet another casualty of England's awful Ashes tour.

Stokes bowled 10 deliveries from the beginning of play on Wednesday, then pulled up in his follow-through holding his right groin.

The all-rounder immediately returned to the dressing room at the Sydney Cricket Ground, handing control of the England team to vice-captain Harry Brook.

"Ben Stokes is currently being assessed for a right adductor complaint," said an England statement. "We will provide an update when more information is available."

'Sydney is a city of endings - this felt like another'

It is a further blow to England in a desperately disappointing series, which they surrendered with losses in the opening three Tests.

After Australia dominated most of the third day of the fifth Test in Sydney, Stokes' team are facing a huge battle to avoid being on the end of a 4-1 defeat.

A serious injury would be a devastating end to the tour for Stokes, who admitted the series has taken a huge personal toll.

Before the first Test in Perth, the 34-year-old spoke of his desire to become one of the "lucky few" England captains to win an Ashes series down under.

By the time his team arrived in Sydney at the end of a tour that has been dogged by poor performances, players out of form, injuries and controversy over England's trip to Noosa, Stokes admitted, "it's been a tough one".

On Test Match Special, BBC chief cricket commentator Jonathan Agnew said: "If this is the way it ends, it is desperately sad. 

"He spoke about his dreams of flying back from here having won the Ashes. That won't be happening. His head is bowed. A really sad way for Ben Stokes' series to end. That sums up the whole thing really."

Stokes has battled knee, hamstring and shoulder injuries over the past three years. Prior to the Ashes, the Durham man had not managed to play a full part in any of England's previous four Test series.

In Sydney, he was into his 28th over of Australia's first innings. The 101.1 overs he has bowled on the tour is the second-most he has delivered in a single series since 2018.

England had already lost three other fast bowlers to injuries in a series in which they planned for pace to be one of their major weapons.

Mark Wood played in the first Test, then was ruled out with a knee injury, while Jofra Archer suffered a side strain after playing in the first three Tests.

Gus Atkinson picked up a hamstring injury in the fourth Test in Melbourne and was ruled out of the Sydney finale.

Although England have lost this series in what is likely to Stokes' last chance at winning the Ashes in Australia, he has reiterated his desire to remain as captain.

Before this series he signed a contract extension that ties him to England to end of the home Ashes in 2027.

With no international or franchise white-ball commitments, Stokes is not due to play again until the home summer. England's next Test is against New Zealand in June.

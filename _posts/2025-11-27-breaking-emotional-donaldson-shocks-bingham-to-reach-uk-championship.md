According to new developments, Scott Donaldson is ranked number 52 in the world

An emotional Scott Donaldson said "I think my dad was doing something" after he came back from 5-0 down to beat Stuart Bingham 6-5 in the final round of qualifying for the UK Championship.

Donaldson, whose father Hector died aged 70 on 2 October, was messaging his wife about driving home when he was 4-0 down against the 2015 world champion in Wigan.  

Bingham had knocked in breaks of 71 and 117 on the way to moving one frame away from victory and a place in the main tournament.

However, Donaldson produced a stirring comeback to stun his rival as the Scotsman made breaks of 56 and 64 before a 110.

He then added breaks of 51, 91 and 64  to complete victory and book a spot at the UK Championship, which starts at the York Barbican on Saturday.

"I played the Scottish Open qualifiers two days after his [Hector] funeral - that was impossible," Donaldson told BBC Radio 5 Live.

"I went to Belfast for which he'd already booked his flights and hotel as he was coming to watch me [at the Northern Ireland Open]. 

"That was incredibly hard - I was just in my seat welling up. I don't know how I managed to get three frames off Wu Yize [in a 4-3 defeat].

"Since then I've kind of been OK because I know he would always want me to just do my stuff. 

"He loved watching me play. In my mind, he's still there watching me play. I just don't know where he is right now."

Donaldson added: "I don't think that was me, I think it was my dad. I just got so much good luck at the end [against Bingham] which was very unusual and I think dad was doing something."

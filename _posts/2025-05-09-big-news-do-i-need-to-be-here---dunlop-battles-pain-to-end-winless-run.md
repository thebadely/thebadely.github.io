According to new developments, Michael Dunlop claimed his first NW200 victory since 2016 - and then immediately made it a double

"I was sore and I was thinking, 'Do I need to be here? It's sore to be here', but I thought it was time to keep going."

They say wins are like buses. You wait ages for one....

Even Michael Dunlop's most ardent supporters - of which there are many - would not have expected him to win two of the opening three races at the 2025 North West 200.

Despite his success at the Isle of Man TT, where he became the rider with the most victories in the road race's storied history in 2024, his home event had been a more barren affair. 

He had not stood on the top step at Northern Ireland's international road race since 2016. 

The fear his winless run on home soil would continue only grew after an accident towards the end of Superstock qualifying on Thursday afternoon.

The 36-year-old had a high side on an out lap exiting the Magherabuoy chicane and, although he returned to the pits to take part in the final two sessions, it was evident to onlookers he wasn't 100% comfortable. 

It was even at the point where Steve Hicken, the team manager of Hawk Racing, said Dunlop might not be able to compete in all three races on Thursday evening. 

But it was wearing those same scuffed leathers that he stood on the top step of the podium on Thursday evening. Not once, but twice.

Michael Dunlop surged to victory on the final lap of the Superstock race

Even after three laps of the Supersport race, victory didn't look on the cards. 

Leaders Davey Todd and Richard Cooper had knocked metaphorical lumps out of each other, which had kept Dunlop in play in a five-bike battle for the lead. 

However, as Cooper looked ready to pull the pin on the fourth and final lap, Dunlop and his new Ducati moved past Todd at Station corner and set after the leader. 

He reeled Cooper in and blasted past him on the run to Magherabuoy - the same chicane where he crashed hours earlier. From there, Dunlop didn't look back. 

Even from the media centre at the top end of the paddock you could hear the cheers from the grandstands as Dunlop crossed the line, despite the roar of the other bikes still finishing their own races.

"It's nice to win in Northern Ireland again at international level," said Dunlop.

"It was about being in the right place at the right time. I've been mugged here before and I got my finger out. The slipstream is beautiful here and I decided it was time to get a push on."

Dunlop admitted he was wondering in the early laps whether he could fight through the pain to finish the race. But, with the leaders still in sight, he persevered.

"I've damaged the shoulder a little bit so I'm struggling to brake full pin. 

"I'm not 100% but I'm not using it as an excuse. The bike was mint."

After that race, Dunlop said he would keep his "head down and keep going".

He did just that. While it was a last-lap dash for his first win, the following race was a much more controlled performance. 

He was aided by Alastair Seeley not being on the grid with a mechanical issue, and contender Peter Hickman skipping a chicane on the opening lap. 

Todd looked to have pulled away out front, but Dunlop reeled him in and an issue at University corner saw the 8TEN rider miss his braking on the penultimate lap.

Although Dean Harrison piled on the pressure, he had no answer and Dunlop came home in first place with a couple of seconds in hand.

"I've proved tonight I'm still fast. It's great, I knew it was going to be hard and I knew that race was going to be hot and heavy," Dunlop added.

"The boys have worked hard to get everything ready, I appreciate it. I haven't won in a long time and it was a kick in the face, so to win again is another weight off my shoulders. 

"I've not come here fully fit for a long time, but we've overcome it and won two races tonight."

Twenty-five years after his passing, this year's North West 200 has been one of celebration of the life and legacy of the legendary Joey Dunlop, who Michael surpassed to claim the Isle of Man TT record last year.

But on Thursday night it was time for Michael, Joey's nephew, to bask in his success as the sun set on the north coast of Northern Ireland. 

With six more races to come on Saturday, he might not be finished yet.

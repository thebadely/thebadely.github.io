It has been recently reported that Donegal won the Ulster Championship in 2025 as Michael Murphy returned to inter-county football

Armagh will face Tyrone in the preliminary round of the 2026 Ulster Championship, while holders Donegal are potential semi-final opponents. 

Kieran McGeeney's side, who have lost three Ulster finals in a row, will have to battle past Tyrone in a tantalising provincial opener. 

The sides played out a thrilling semi-final in last year's Ulster Championship as Armagh ran out one-point winners. 

Armagh last won the Anglo Celt Cup in 2008 while Tyrone last triumphed in 2021.

The winner of that tie will face Fermanagh in the quarter-finals, while Donegal or Down will then await in the last four. 

Jim McGuinness' Donegal have defeated Armagh in the past two deciders and are aiming to become the first county to win the Ulster final three times in a row since the Orchard County's treble 20 years ago.

On the top half of the draw, Derry will be heavy favourites against Antrim in their quarter-final and the winner will take on Monaghan or Cavan, who were paired together in an intriguing derby, in the last four. 

Dates for the fixtures will be announced by the GAA in due course.

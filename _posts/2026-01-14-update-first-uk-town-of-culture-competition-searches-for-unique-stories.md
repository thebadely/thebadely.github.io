Let's dive into the details: The government has launched its first ever UK Town of Culture competition, where towns of all sizes across the country can enter to tell their "unique stories".

First announced in October 2025, the event is part the government's effort to "restore pride in communities", and encourages applicants to showcase local visions and voices through a cultural programme.

Three finalists will be chosen by an expert panel, where the winner will be awarded a £3m prize, and the two runners-up each receiving £250,000.

Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said towns have "shaped our national story for decades" and the competition was a chance for them to "make a real difference in their local community".

The event intends to complement the quadrennial UK City of Culture, with applications for the 2029 edition already underway - Bradford won the title in 2025.

In a press release, the government said the plan is part of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's "ambition to restore pride in every part of Britain".

Towns can begin submitting their bids now and the strongest candidates will progress to a shortlist, with each shortlisted town receiving £60,000 in funding.

Leading the panel for UK Town of Culture 2028 will be Sir Phil Redmond, who said the competition is a opportunity for local communities celebrate their towns.

"UK Town of Culture asks what makes your town special? What makes its people proud to be there? And why should that be celebrated?" he said.

It follows the government's Pride in Place Programme launched in November 2025, where Labour pledged to provide up to £10bn in funding to 244 towns across the country.

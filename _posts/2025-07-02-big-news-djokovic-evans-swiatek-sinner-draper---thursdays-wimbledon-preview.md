According to new developments, Novak Djokovic is fighting for an eighth Wimbledon title

It has been a Wimbledon of upsets so far.

Eight top-10 seeds across the men's and women's singles draws exited in the first round - the most at a Grand Slam in the Open era - before Jasmine Paolini joined the exodus in the second round on Wednesday.

Among those avoiding shock defeats on day three were defending men's champion Carlos Alcaraz and women's world number one Aryna Sabalenka, beating Ollie Tarvet and Marie Bouzkova to progress to the third round.

On day four the other side of the draw will play for a second time, with seven-time champion Novak Djokovic, men's world number one Jannik Sinner and Britain's Jack Draper among those in action.

Rain delayed play by two hours on Wednesday, but the forecast is looking clear as we move to the fourth day of the Championships.

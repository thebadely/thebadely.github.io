It has been recently reported that Libraries across East Yorkshire are to hold costume swap shops in the run up to Halloween.

People have until 19 October to drop off unwanted, spooky-themed items. They will  then be put on display for people to choose and collect from 20 October until 2 November.

The participating branches are Bridlington Central, Withernsea, Haltemprice, Goole, South Cave, Beverley and the Pocklington Pocela Centre.

Librarian Jess McCarthy said: "We're so glad to be doing the costume swap for Halloween. It's a great way to get involved while also doing your bit for the environment."

The scheme, which was first held in 2024, was developed to reduce the environmental impact of single use and help families with the cost of living, East Riding of Yorkshire Council said.

Tara Foxon, also a librarian, added: "Halloween can be an expensive time for families who need to buy new costumes.

"We're trying to make sure everyone can get into the spooky spirit without having to spend a fortune.

"Whether they're donating an old costume or picking a new one, it's a lovely way to bring the community into libraries across the East Riding."

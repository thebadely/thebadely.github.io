Hereâ€™s what you need to know: A mother and her three children who died after a house fire that took place in north-west London in the early hours of Saturday morning have been named by police.

Nusrat Usman, 43, her daughter Maryam Mikaiel, 15 and two sons Musa Usman, eight, and Raees Usman, four, died when the house in Stonebridge, Brent, went up in flames, the Metropolitan Police said. 

A 13-year-old girl, who has not been named, remains in hospital in critical condition while a woman in her 70s has been discharged.

A man, 41, was arrested on suspicion of murder outside the property. He has since been bailed and detained under the Mental Health Act, the Met said.

Officers were called to Tillett Close at around 01:20 BST on Saturday, attending alongside the London Fire Brigade (LFB).

Two terraced three-storey homes were gutted in the fire.

Eight fire engines and about 70 firefighters from stations across Wembley, Park Royal and Willesden were sent to tackle the blaze.

A teddy bear and flowers were seen laid near the properties on Sunday.

Supt Steve Allen, from the local policing team, said on Sunday that specialist officers were supporting the family.

"Our thoughts go out to all those impacted by what has happened," he said.

"Local officers are working closely with officers from the Specialist Crime Command on what continues to be a very complex investigation."

Extra officers will also be deployed to the area in the coming days, he added. 

A woman and child were initially rescued from the second floor of one of the affected properties and received emergency care but were declared dead at the scene, the LFB said on Saturday. 

Two more children were found inside the property and also declared dead, it added.

Keeley Foster, LFB assistant commissioner, described the incident as "extremely tragic" and said the attending crew were met with a "well-developed fire".

She added that the LFB would work with the Met to determine the cause of the fire.

One neighbour, who said the family had moved to the UK from Pakistan more than 20 years ago, told the BBC that after hearing smashing and screaming, she had gone out to find the building on fire.

Mohamed Labidi, a 38-year-old teacher who lives in Tillett Close, told the news agency PA that the family were "really good people".

Another neighbour said she felt "numb" and was "stunned by the devastation" the fire had caused.

The leader of Brent council, the local MP and London's mayor have all expressed their condolences.

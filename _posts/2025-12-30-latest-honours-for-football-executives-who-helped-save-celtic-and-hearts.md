Let's dive into the details: Former Celtic chief executive Fergus McCann and ex-Hearts chair Ann Budge have been named in the New Year Honours.

Lisbon Lion Jim Craig, New Seekers singer Eve Graham, leading forensic scientist Prof Lorna Dawson and former UK defence minister Adam Ingram are also among those who have been recognised.

They have been joined by others including the chief executive of the Royal Edinburgh Botanic Garden, the chief constable of Police Scotland, a heritage kiltmaker and the founders of an island college.

Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander congratulated the recipients and said the annual list was "packed with local heroes".

Fergus McCann, who has been made an CBE for services to the economy and to charity, had a controlling stake in Celtic for five years from 1994. 

The Parkhead team were hours from bankruptcy when the Stirling-born Canadian businessman paid off its debts.

He later oversaw the rebuilding of Celtic Park, funded in part by a share issue, and stabilised the Glasgow club's finances. 

In 2016 he told BBC Scotland: "I had a responsibility to the supporters to make sure their money wasn't wasted."

Budge, who becomes an OBE, performed a similar rescue act at Hearts.

The Edinburgh side was plunged into administration in 2013 after Vladimir Romanov left the club millions in debt.

But working alongside the Foundation of Hearts she put up £2.5m of her own money and has since made it the largest fan-owned club in the UK.

The businesswoman, who also delivered a new main stand and introduced a living wage for staff, stood down as chair earlier this month with Hearts top of the Scottish Premiership.

Jim Craig, who becomes an OBE, is best known as a member of the legendary 1967 Celtic team which became the first British side to lift the European Cup.

The defender - who later enjoyed a career as a dentist - also won seven league titles, four Scottish Cups and three league cups.

Eve Graham - who has also been awarded an OBE - and the New Seekers enjoyed international success with tracks like I'd Like To Teach The World To Sing.

The band also represented Britain at the 1972 Eurovision Song Contest.

At the height of the band's success, the Perth and Kinross-based singer toured Europe and the US.

She even performed at President Richard Nixon's inauguration ball in 1973.

Prof Lorna Dawson, head of the Centre for Forensic Soil Science at the James Hutton Institute in Aberdeen, said she was "delighted and humbled" to be given a damehood.

The expert has spent more than three decades researching soil and plant interactions with a particular interest in how this can be used in the criminal justice system.

Prof Dawson has given evidence in some of Scotland's highest-profile murder cases.

These include the conviction of Angus Sinclair for the World's End murders; the prosecution of William MacDowell for the 1976 murders of Renee MacRae and her three-year-old son; and the trial of Iain Packer for the 2005 murder of Emma Caldwell.

The mother-of-three said: "This honour recognises the power of scientific innovation, partnership, and how forensic soil science can support justice on a national and global scale.

"I thank in particular my family for supporting me, and the many people in organisations I have worked with to help establish forensic soil science as an accepted and invaluable discipline across the world."

Meanwhile, the Royal Edinburgh Botanic Garden's chief executive said it was an "immense honour" to have been awarded a knighthood as he prepares to retire.

Simon Milne, whose formal title is regius keeper, has been recognised for his services to botany, conservation and horticulture.

In January the former Royal Marine Commando told BBC Scotland he was "devastated" after Storm Éowyn felled the tallest tree in Edinburgh - 166 years after it was planted during a visit by Queen Victoria's eldest son, Albert.

Sir Simon said his interest in plants dates to the 1970s when his uncle brought back seeds from the Far East and he volunteered on a local nature reserve.

He said: "On reflection, these early experiences inspired my lifelong curiosity in nature and commitment to conservation.

"Receiving this award as I prepare to retire from such an extraordinary community is deeply meaningful."

The only other regius keeper to have received a knighthood since the garden's inception in 1670 was Sir Isaac Bayley Balfour.

He was named in the 1920 civilian war honours list for "services in connection with the war". 

This included persuading the War Office of the benefits of using sphagnum moss for wound dressings. 

Elsewhere, Adam Ingram, former Labour MP for East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow, received a knighthood for parliamentary and political service.

Sir Adam served as Northern Ireland security minister from 1997-2001 and as armed forces minister from 2001-2007.

When he stood down from that post in 2007, he had been the longest-serving defence minister in the history of the Ministry of Defence.

Labour MP for Oxford East, Dr Anneliese Dodds, has also been recognised.

The Aberdeen-born politician has been made a dame.

Other Scots honoured in the list include Lady Rae, a senior judge and lawyer, who has been made a CBE for services to the law, charity and education in Scotland.

Prof Sue Rigby, principal of Edinburgh Napier University, becomes a CBE for services to higher education.

Scotland's top police officer said she was "honoured and grateful" to receive the King's Police Medal (KPM).

Chief Constable Jo Farrell, a former head of Durham Constabulary, has led Police Scotland since 2023.

The force's Chief Supt Stevie Dolan and retired Assistant Chief Constable Andy Freeburn will also receive the KPM.

Farrell said: "These honours are recognition of the skill and hard work of officers and staff who deliver for communities and keep Scotland safe."

Marion Foster, founder of the College of Master Kilt Tailors, has been made an MBE for services to Scottish craftsmanship.

She said: "When I received the letter, I was stunned, it brought tears to my eyes, and I kept re-reading it. 

"It was confidential so I have had to keep the news to myself."

Roland Engebretsen and Rebecca Lindsay, the co-founders of Macaulay College, near Stornoway in Lewis, have both been awarded MBEs for services to education, social inclusion and to people with additional support needs.

The artists and educators set up their college on Mr Engebretsen's grandfather's farm in 2010.

Adults with additional support needs are offered the chance to work on the farm and look after animals including goats, sheep, ponies and chickens.

Engebretsen said he was initially suspicious of the letter informing him of his honour when it dropped through the letterbox.

"It was a very official looking letter. I assumed I was in trouble," he said.

"I'm glad it wasn't. It was a lovely surprise."

Rebecca Lindsay she was "totally overwhelmed" to find out.

"I'm exceptionally grateful," she added.

Let's dive into the details: Scott Penny scored a superb hat-trick for Leinster

United Rugby Championship

Leinster 28 (7)

Tries: Deegan, Penny 3 Cons: Tector 3 Pens:

Edinburgh 20 (15)

Tries: Van der Merwe, Satala Cons: Thompson Pens: Thompson

Leinster proved too strong for Edinburgh in the URC as the Irish side came from behind to earn a bonus-point win.

Tries from Duhan van der Merwe - released by Scotland for the trip to Dublin - and Malelili Satala gave Edinburgh the lead at half-time after Max Deegan had crossed for the hosts.

However, Edinburgh were unable to sustain their level of performance in the second half and Scott Penny's hat-trick ensured Leinster ran out comfortable winners.

Charlie Shiel barged through several home defenders to score a late consolation try for Edinburgh, but Cammy Scott completely scuffed his conversion attempt as Sean Everitt's side missed the opportunity to take a losing bonus point.

It was perhaps a portent of things to come for Edinburgh when Ross Thompson missed a very kickable penalty in the early stages for a much-changed Edinburgh outfit.

Lock Callum Hunter-Hill was then sent to the sin-bin for a high tackle, before Deegan burrowed his way over for the game's opening score.

However, Edinburgh rallied and after a strong carry from Ben Muncaster, scrum-half Ben Vellacott released Van der Merwe down the left wing and the out-of-favour Scotland international finished with aplomb.

After missing the conversion, Thompson kicked a penalty to give the visitors the lead and the went into the break eight points to the good as Satala showed good pace to dot down in the corner.

It was a different story after the interval though. Penny benefitted from Vellacott's charged-down box-kick to bring Leinster back in touch.

And the excellent flanker was on hand twice more to capitalise on wave after wave of Leinster attack as the competition's defending champions made sure of five points.

Edinburgh thought they would at least take a point back across the Irish Sea when Shiel crossed, but Scott was unable to convert off the tee.

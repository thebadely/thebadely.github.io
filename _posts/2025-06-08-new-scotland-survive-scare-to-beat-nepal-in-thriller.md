Scorecard

Scotland survived a major scare to beat Nepal in a thrilling Cricket World Cup League 2 match at Forthill.

Nepal won with one ball to spare when the sides met at the same ground on Monday before beating the Netherlands two days later.

They came close to a third straight win on Scottish soil, but fell two runs short in a chase of 323 in a game that swung back and forth throughout.

A magnificent sixth one-day international hundred from Scotland captain Richie Berrington, along with an unbeaten 96 off just 62 deliveries from Michael Leask propelled the hosts to an imposing total.

Nepal ultimately fell two runs short as debutant Mackenzie Jones took three wickets, while Leask and Safyaan Sharif claimed two apiece.

"I don't think I was ready for another close game like that," captain Richie Berrington said.

"Delighted to get over the line. Credit to Nepal for the way they fought back and it's great to see the guys hold their nerve.

"Mackenzie Jones took really important wickets and then Safyaan Sharif showed all his experience at the end.

"It's always nice to contribute to the team's efforts and Leasky took the pressure off me."

After Berrington won the toss, opener Charlie Tear played well for his 68 after George Munsey and Brandon McMullen both fell victim to the new ball. 

His contribution, paired with his captain's fine effort, allowed Leask to attack in the final 10 overs. 

Scotland's number seven struck 12 fours and three sixes on his home ground in a brutal display of power hitting.

Berrington's side then started in fine fashion with the ball, reducing Nepal to 34-3, including a first international wicket for Jones.

Nepal rebuilt through Bhim Sharki (73) and Aarif Sheikh (39), but when they were removed by Leask and Jones, respectively, Scotland appeared to be in total control.

However, a partnership of 105 for the seventh wicket between Dipendra Singh Airee  (56) and Sompal Kami (67) brought Nepal right back into the contest.

Jones caught Singh Airee off Charlie Cassell's bowling and removed Kami himself as the ball followed the Essex seamer on his first Scotland outing.

Nepal needed seven to win off the final over - bowled by Safyaan Sharif - and Jones was called into action again, taking a towering catch at long-leg to remove the dangerous Karan KC.

It left Nepal needing five off three balls, but Sharif held his nerve to bowl Lalit Rajbanshi and win the game for Scotland.

It was the seamer's 258th wicket for Scotland, taking him level with Majid Haq as his country's all-time leading wicket-taker.

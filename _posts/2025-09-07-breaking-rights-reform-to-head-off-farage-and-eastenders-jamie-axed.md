It has been recently reported that The Sunday Telegraph says that the new Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood will announce within weeks that migrants in asylum-seeker hotels will be moved into barracks on former military bases. The paper says Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has instructed her to "get a grip" on the small boats crisis. 

The Sunday Times says the new cabinet is prepared to overhaul human rights laws to head off Nigel Farage even if it makes Sir Keir's MPs feel queasy. The paper's cartoonist, Newman, depicts one Downing Street press officer asking another, "We've had a reboot, a reset and a reshuffle. What's next?" The answer? "Reform?"

The Sunday Express says HMRC has failed to answer four million phone calls from businesses trying to pay what they owe - resulting in the Treasury failing to collect what it calls a "staggering" Â£47bn. The paper says this would be enough to plug the black hole in the public finances, without having to hike taxes.

Many of the papers are underwhelmed by England's 2-0 victory over Andorra in qualifying for next summer's football World Cup. The Daily Star says it was another bore from Thomas Tuchel and his tame three lions. The Sunday Telegraph says England were turgid as they struggled to beat the minnows. The Sunday Express says Villa Park was half-empty at the final whistle, as England laboured to a dull victory.

The Sun on Sunday and the Sunday Mirror lead on the BBC's decision to axe Jamie Borthwick from EastEnders, after he made a disabled slur during his time on Strictly Come Dancing. The Mail on Sunday says that the actor apologised at the time, saying he didn't fully understand the derogatory nature of the term.

Let's dive into the details: Scrum-half Kieran Hardy (right) scored twice in the first half as Wales finally halted their record losing streak

Summer tour second Test

Japan (10) 22

Tries: Takeuch, Dearns, Riley Cons: Lee 2 Pens: Lee 

Wales (21) 31

Tries: Adams, Hardy 2, Edwards Cons: Edwards 4 Pens: Edwards

Wales held on for a first international win in 644 days as they ended their 18-Test losing run by defeating Japan in Kobe.

The tourists levelled the series at 1-1 as they withheld a spirited second-half Japan comeback in the heat and humidity under the closed roof at the Noevir Stadium.

Wales had built up a 21-3 lead thanks to two tries from scrum-half Kieran Hardy and a Josh Adams score. 

Just as they did in their win in Kitakyushu last weekend Eddie Jones' side rallied, with tries from prop Shuhei Takeuchi, lock Warner Dearns and centre Dylan Riley bringing the hosts to within two points.

A late Edwards try, which gave the Ospreys fly-half a 16-point haul in his first Wales start, sealed the win and gave the tourists some joy for the first time in 21 months.

Wales' previous win was against Georgia in the 2023 World Cup, and it was a welcome victory in the fifth and final game in charge for interim head coach Matt Sherratt.

Cardiff head coach Sherratt, who took over from Warren Gatland during the Six Nations in February, and captain Dewi Lake were both emotional after the final whistle.

Gatland's permanent successor will be unveiled by the Welsh Rugby Union in the next couple of weeks and will not now be burdened by the losing streak.

Wales have returned to 12th in the world rankings after last week dropping two places to a lowest-ever position of 14th.

Following the tourists' 24-19 defeat in Kitakyushu, Wales were trying to avoid history in Kobe, while Japan were attempting to create it.

Wales were aiming to not set a tier one record of 19 successive international defeats, surpassing the sequence of France between 1911 and 1920.

The Brave Blossoms were looking to secure a maiden series win against Wales and back-to-back wins against a tier one side for the first time ever.

Sherratt said he wanted to freshen things up and Ospreys fly-half Edwards made his first international start in place of Sam Costelow as one of four changes.

Wing Josh Adams scored the first of Wales' four tries in Kobe

It was a cagey opening period which was dominated by high kicks and handling errors.

The mediocrity was lifted by an Alex Mann turnover and piece of class from centre Ben Thomas, who released Blair Murray to set up Adams for the opening score, which Edwards converted.

Aaron Wainwright was a constant ball-carrying influence in the first half, while Japan's first attack saw Ichigo Nakakusu and Halatoa Vailea release captain Michael Leitch, with Wales flanker Josh Macleod making a crucial tackle.

Wainwright was again Wales' inspiration when his grubber kick was spilled by Adams with the try line begging as the greasy ball struck again.

It would not have counted because Macleod was penalised for a high tackle during the build-up, and Lee Seung-sin slotted the resulting kick to get the hosts on the scoreboard.

Wales started to dominate through their line-out drives, and the hosts' number eight Faulua Makisi was shown a yellow card by referee Luke Pearce as they gave away a series of penalties.

Makisi's infringement came in the build-up to Hardy burrowing over, after incisive work from Lake.

The improved Wales set-piece then set up the platform for Adams to show his class with a fine run that was finished by Hardy.

Japan coach Jones had seen enough and replaced his front row three minutes before half-time.

It was an inspired choice as the new trio immediately forced a scrum penalty and replacement prop Takeuchi dived over. Lee converted to reduce the Wales half-time lead to 21-10.

Ospreys wing Keelan Giles finally gained his first cap, nine years after first being involved in the Wales squad, when he came on for the injured Adams.

Wales lost two early line-outs to invite pressure as Japan again started the second-half looking far more threatening.

The hosts' momentum was stopped by a Macleod turnover penalty which Edwards slotted over.

Wales were hampered by their indiscipline but Japan's handling initially let them down before lock Dearns burrowed over for a try.

Wales rung the changes which included a debut for Dragons prop Chris Coleman before a glaring drop from Edwards was pounced on by Riley who sprinted unopposed to score.

Centre Johnny Williams was forced off to instigate a major reshuffle which involved replacement scrum-half Reuben Morgan-Williams coming on for first cap.

Morgan-Williams and Hardy both spent stints on the wing with Tom Rogers moving into the centre.

Wales kept their cool and Edwards dived over for the crucial score after some fine handling, especially from replacement Taine Plumtree, who produced a brilliant piece of individual skill with a fine reverse pass.

Wales suffered in the final quarter in the Kitakyushu conditions with Taulupe Faletau suffering heat-related cramps that ruled him out of the Kobe contest and players trying to stay cool by wearing ice hats.

The conditions meant World Rugby mandated water breaks in each half and an extended 20-minute half-time interval for both games.

The Noevir Stadium roof was closed which saw Wales triumph in temperatures topping 32C and 67% humidity outside.

Japan coach Jones labelled it "ironic" there had been a debate surrounding Wales and a roof being closed, referring to the Principality Stadium and similar issues that have taken place in games in Cardiff.

Japan tried to make the most of home advantage with mid-afternoon kick-off times dictated by the hosts despite the WRU asking for later starts.

Captain Michael Leitch said after the Kitakyushu win Wales were blowing in the latter stages and the red jerseys were suffering more than Japan.

Visiting scrum coach Adam Jones said he hoped Leitch would have a different viewpoint after the game and Wales were able to finish more strongly and triumph.

Let's dive into the details: Belinda Bencic, who was ranked fourth in the world in 2020, is now ranked 35th 

Wimbledon 2025

Dates: 30 June-13 July Venue: All England Club

Belinda Bencic knew what she would be thinking about before she went to sleep on Wednesday night.

The Swiss player uses the time before she drifts off to visualise her gameplan for her next match and her next opponent.

That next match is the small matter of a first Wimbledon semi-final, and against five-time major winner Iga Swiatek.

"She is a big challenge and I'm really excited to play her. We've had some close matches. I will come up with a plan," the 28-year-old former Olympic champion said.

Explaining her method of preparation, she said: "I'm not so much of a writer. For me it's more like imagining some plays.

"It's important for me to do it before I go to sleep. While I'm falling asleep, I go through it unconsciously.

"It's something that happens naturally and then I'm able to kind of memorise it a little bit."

Bencic was not worried about her sleep being broken by her 14-month-old daughter, Bella, who is with her in London.

"I don't adjust anything, I'm just being a mum at home. When she cries in the night, I'll wake up," said Bencic, who is seeking to become the first mother to win a Wimbledon singles title in 45 years.

"It's not something that's going to affect me for my [match]."

Earlier during Wimbledon, she explained: "I see myself as a mum first, and then tennis player. My priorities are clearly with my family."

It has been nearly six years since Bencic last reached the final four of a Grand Slam, ultimately losing in straight sets to Bianca Andreescu in the 2019 US Open semi-finals.

Having been on maternity leave from September 2023 to October 2024, she said she has been "surprised" by how quickly the positive results have come.

Bencic started the year ranked 489th in the world and is now projected to break back into the world's top 20 after Wimbledon. Success this year has also included winning the Abu Dhabi WTA 500 title in February.

She said motherhood has had a positive impact on her approach to being a professional player, making her "more relaxed" and ensuring she has less time to think about tennis.

Bencic was joined by Bella in the outdoor gym at Aorangi Park on Wednesday morning. Bella played with medicine balls while her mother prepared for her 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-2) victory over Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva.

She has also been watched by her daughter from a balcony above court 18, which she said was "kind of unreal".

"Sometimes you realise, 'Wow, I'm playing Wimbledon, I have my family here, my daughter is actually watching me'," she said.

"She will not remember anything - she doesn't realise yet - but still it's a very nice feeling."

Bella is too young to be on Centre Court so Bencic's husband - who is also her fitness coach - will once again be absent from the box when she takes on Swiatek.

But Bencic would not want it any other way.

"No, she definitely gets the priority," she added. "I'm really happy when he looks after her.

"It means the world to me to be in the semi-final. It's definitely unreal, but it doesn't end here."

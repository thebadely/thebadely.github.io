It has been recently reported that James has started all five games at Euro 2025 so far

England manager Sarina Wiegman "does not know yet" whether forward Lauren James will be available for Sunday's Euro 2025 final.

James was substituted at half-time of England's semi-final victory over Italy on Tuesday with an ankle injury.

She was seen applying ice to her ankle while sitting in the dugout for the remainder of the match, which went to extra time before England won 2-1.

The 23-year-old has scored two goals in Switzerland to help England reach the final against world champions Spain on Sunday (17:00 BST).

"She's still recovering. She's doing things on the pitch and we have two more days so we're going to give her time," said Wiegman.

"I don't know yet [if she'll be ready], but that's what we're going to go for - 23 players available for the game on Sunday."

England 'not' using World Cup final defeat as motivation v Spain - Wiegman

If James loses her race to be fit, then who should replace her in the team will become a huge topic of debate, similar to that around the timing of Wiegman's substitutions, which has dominated conversation this tournament.

The Dutch manager has faced calls to make changes earlier in games if things are going to plan, but she argued it is not that simple.

"It's not a decision that we just make in the moment - when we name the squad, we talk about what me might need at certain moments in games. And what player will fit that," she said.

"Of course it's very nice that we have these players available as options to play for England.

"We have already thought of scenarios, what we might need at certain stages of the game, and which player will fit in that scenario.

"Before every game we sit down and talk through what we might potentially need in the game. And the 'when' [to make the change] is just a feeling - sometimes you might think 'OK, we are doing better now in the second half, so lets keep it [the same], but then when you don't create chances or a goal then you have to change something. 

"Change the dynamics a little bit or make your opponent uncomfortable, make them adapt to a new player in the same position. It's a feeling during the game, but of course a lot of preparation has been done before that moment."

Two players pushing for starting berths are Chloe Kelly and 19-year-old Michelle Agyemang, who both played key roles from the bench to rescue England against Sweden and Italy in the quarter-finals and semi-finals respectively.

"It's a nice one [problem] to have, but you mention those two [Kelly and Agyemang] because they have been coming on and scoring goals. But I think Grace Clinton has also made a great contribution - she had to play in Keira [Walsh's] position when Keira had to come out, a very important position.

"Niamh Charles came in against Sweden and made a crucial header defensively. You can talk about more players who have made an impact coming on from the bench. It gives us headaches but I want to have those headaches.

"We look at what opponent we have in front of us and what would fit best when we start the game."

Wiegman said "it's really nice to feel the support," after Football Association chief executive Mark Bullingham said that she is "not for sale at any price". 

That said, she would not be drawn on her future beyond the end of her current contract, which expires after the 2027 Women's World Cup.

"I'm so 'in' these Euros - we play a final on Sunday and there is nothing else that I am thinking about," Wiegman said.

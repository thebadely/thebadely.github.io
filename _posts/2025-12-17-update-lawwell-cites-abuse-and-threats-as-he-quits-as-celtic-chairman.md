It has been recently reported that Peter Lawwell spent 18 years as chief executive and three as chairman

Peter Lawwell will stand down as Celtic chairman at the end of December - citing "abuse and threats" - as chief executive Michael Nicholson revealed that three staff members were assaulted at Celtic Park after Sunday's League Cup final defeat.

The club's board have been the subject of fan protests this term following a disappointing summer transfer window, a Champions League exit and the fact they trail leaders Hearts in the Scottish Premiership.

Defeat by St Mirren at Hampden on Sunday means Wilfried Nancy has lost his first three games since replacing interim boss Martin O'Neill, who oversaw an upturn in form after replacing Brendan Rodgers after his resignation in October.

Nicholson said the board's support for the Frenchman is "absolutely solid" despite a "disappointing" and "challenging" start.

He also revealed that meetings had been held this week to discuss signing targets for January and next season.

Lawwell, who became Celtic chief executive in 2003 and presided over the club for 18 years, was the victim of a fire attack on his South Lanarkshire home in May 2021, when three cars were set alight.

The 66-year-old told the club website it was "with sadness" that he was ending his three-year spell as chairman.

"I believe I have shown my ability to meet and overcome challenges on many fronts, but abuse and threats from some sources have increased and are now intolerable," Lawwell said. "They have dismayed and alarmed my family. 

"At this stage in my life, I don't need this. I cannot accept this and so I leave the club I have loved all my life.

"The motivations and aims of these detractors can be investigated by others. I prefer to look back on my career at Celtic with deep gratitude and satisfaction."

Nicholson described it as "a sad day" that Lawwell had stood down as a result of "behaviours we have seen from perhaps a very small minority".

"We had a situation with three of our colleagues were assaulted at Celtic Park on Sunday night and these behaviours are completely unacceptable," he added.

Principal shareholder Dermot Desmond paid tribute to "all he has given" to Celtic over so many years.

He pointed out that Lawwell had overseen the building of their training centre at Lennoxtown, the creation of the new facility at Barrowfield, and the upgrading of Celtic Park during his time at the club.

"I am personally very sorry to lose Peter, but I understand and respect his decision in light of recent events and what he has endured," Desmond said.

"As chief executive, Peter was the driving force of the club and, in his later role as chairman, he oversaw board affairs.

"Peter has witnessed 38 cup or title triumphs in his time at the club, a period of extraordinary domestic dominance for us as we have also competed in European football."

Non-executive director Brian Wilson will become interim chairman from 31 December until a permanent appointment is made.

Stressing the temporary nature of his appointment, Wilson predicted that Lawwell's achievements will be more appreciated in the long term. 

"What we are trying to do is part of a process of change," he said. "Hopefully the problems everybody recognises have arisen in recent times can be addressed."

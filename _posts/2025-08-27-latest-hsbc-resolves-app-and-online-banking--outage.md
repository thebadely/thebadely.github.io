Experts revealed that HSBC says it has now fixed an issue which left customers unable to access online banking or use its app in the UK, preventing some from accessing their accounts.

Thousands of people reported problems on outage-checking site Downdetector since the issues first emerged at 11:00 BST on Wednesday.

Five hours after the issue was reported by angry customers online, the bank now says the problem has been resolved. 

"We apologise to our customers who were impacted, and we'll continue to monitor systems closely," it told the BBC.

Customers took to social media to complain about the impact the outage had on them.

One person said it was "very worrying", with others complaining it comes amid bank branches being closed in the UK in the past few years.

In 2022, HSBC announced the closure of 114 branches in the UK. It later promised not to close any more branches until 2026.

It is the latest in a long line of banking outages - with a number of major banks in May accepting 1.2m people were affected by them in 2024.

Meanwhile, in March a report found nine major banks and building societies have had around 803 hours - the equivalent of 33 days - of outages since 2023.

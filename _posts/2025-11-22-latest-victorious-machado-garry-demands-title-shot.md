Here’s what you need to know: Ian Machado Garry's only defeat was against Shavkat Rakhmonov in 2024

Ian Machado Garry continued his climb towards a welterweight title shot by beating Belal Muhammad at UFC Qatar in Doha.

The Irishman secured his 17th career win with a unanimous points victory over the former champion at the ABHA Arena.

Machado Garry, 28, declared himself the number one contender to fight champion Islam Makhachev.

"I just beat the number one welterweight in the world, the former champion," Machado Garry said.

"There is nobody else above him other than the world champion. Belal couldn't take me down, so Islam, you try take me down. I'm telling you now, I am the best in the world.

"You have a duty to defend that belt against the best welterweight in the world and you are looking at him.

"I am taking that throne from you. There is nobody getting in the way of me and my future and my dreams, so sign the contract and I will see you soon."

American Muhammad, 37, opted to strike with Machado Garry for the first round, but found little success against an opponent with longer range.

But Muhammad's efforts to switch to his grappling strengths were repeatedly thwarted.

Machado Garry shrugged off his seven attempts at takedowns and landed 72 significant strikes to Muhammad's 56.

But after failing to produce a finish, huge knockout wins last week for Carlos Prates and Michael Morales against top contenders Leon Edwards and Sean Brady respectively may well push them ahead of Machado Garry in the pecking order for a title shot.

Makhachev's destruction of former champion Jack Della Maddalena at UFC 322 last week crowned a new champion of the division.

The Russian, 34, is now a two-weight champion and has not lost an MMA fight since 2015, his sole career loss to Adriano Martins.

In the main event Arman Tsarukyan protected his number one lightweight ranking by submitting Dan Hooker in round two.

Armenian Tsarukyan is chasing a second title shot after he was forced to withdraw from his first chance in January in fight week because of injury.

Tsarukyan, 29, made short work of 34-year-old Hooker, taking the New Zealander to the ground before working his way into an arm-triangle submission.

Lightweight champion Ilia Topuria has the pick of contenders, including Tsarukyan and Britain's Paddy Pimblett.

Briton Luke Riley made a perfect start to his UFC career with a second-round knockout of Bogdan Grad.

The 26-year-old featherweight overcame a difficult first round when he struggled to get to grips with the pace and grappling of Grad.

But with gym team-mate Pimblett in his corner, Riley came flying out in the second round and landed a massive left hand to send Grad down.

The Austrian tried to fight off Riley but, with heavy strikes raining down, the referee stopped the contest.

"I'm my own worst critic," Riley said, citing a bad first round. 

"Line them up - I'm taking them all out. I'll be back soon."

Pimblett was among the first to celebrate with Riley, who ended a losing streak for fighters who have transitioned from Cage Warriors to the UFC in 2025 after losses for Jordan Vucenic, Nathan Fletcher and Harry Hardwick.

Riley improved his record to 12-0, with nine stoppages.

Britain's Shem Rock suffered a points loss on his UFC debut to Tajikistan's Nurullo Aliev in their lightweight bout.

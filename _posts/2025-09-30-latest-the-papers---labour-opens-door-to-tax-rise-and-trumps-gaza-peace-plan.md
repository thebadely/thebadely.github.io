Let's dive into the details: The Guardian leads on the ultimatum given to Hamas by the US and Israel: accept proposals for peace in Gaza or face the consequences. The Daily Telegraph carries the headline "Trump to govern Gaza with Blair". The paper says Sir Tony Blair has been working on a post-war plan for Gaza, since the 7 October attacks by Hamas. The Times says the former prime minister is "back from the wilderness" but adds that his involvement carries risks, in the form of being bound to an unpredictable US President Donald Trump.

The Daily Mirror leads on the introduction of "online hospitals", with appointments booked online, to be announced by Prime MinisterSir Keir Starmer at the Labour conference. The paper's editorial stresses that 2.8 million people in the UK lack internet access, and urges some provision be made for them. 

Sir Keir will, in his speech, describe economic growth as the "antidote to division", according to the Guardian. Downing Street aides tell the Telegraph it will be the prime minister's most "political" speech to date.

The Financial Times says the chancellor opened the door for tax rises when she used her conference speech to appeal for fiscal discipline. Rachel Reeves "lit the fuse for another tax bombshell", is how the Daily Express describes it.

The Daily Mail reports the Chancellor is plotting a "VAT raid" on the middle classes, with private healthcare in the firing line. The Sun lauds her stated ambition to abolish youth unemployment but suggests Reeves should focus on the high number of young people who are "on the sick", the paper says.

The Times reports that the chancellor is facing competition from China over a vast sum confiscated from a Chinese fraudster. Zhimin Qian pleaded guilty in London on Monday to money laundering, and the Treasury is said to have earmarked more than Â£5bn in seized crypto-currency to boost the public finances. But the Times says Beijing has staked a claim based on the fact the money comes from a scheme targeting its citizens. The case is now the focus of intense diplomatic activity, according to the paper.

Let's dive into the details: Keely Hodgkinson captured her first global title at 2024 Paris Olympics

Keely Hodgkinson is set to contest her first race since being crowned Olympic 800m champion 12 months ago, while fellow Briton Georgia Hunter Bell targets her third Diamond League win of the season in Silesia, Poland.

England's Hodgkinson, who suffered setbacks during her recovery from a hamstring injury sustained in February, will make her long-awaited return to competitive action just four weeks before the start of the World Championships in Tokyo.

The 23-year-old, a two-time world silver medallist, will race over 800m in Silesia - an event that is not part of the Diamond League programme at this meeting.

Training partner Hunter Bell contests the women's 1500m as the Olympic bronze medallist weighs up whether to target that event in Tokyo, or join Hodgkinson in the 800m. 

Following 800m wins at the Diamond League events in Stockholm and London, Hunter Bell will test herself against Ethiopia's Gudaf Tsegay and Diribe Welteji in a high-quality line-up.

Hodgkinson and Hunter Bell, who are both coached by Trevor Painter and Jenny Meadows, are set to go head-to-head in the 800m at the Lausanne Diamond League next Wednesday.

Also in Silesia, Dina Asher-Smith takes on world champion Sha'Carri Richardson in the women's 100m, while Daryll Neita and Amy Hunt are up against two-time world champion Shericka Jackson in the 200m.

World indoor champion Amber Anning is in the women's 400m, and the men's 1500m features Neil Gourley.

Armand Duplantis - who this week broke the men's pole vault world record for the 13th time - Faith Kipyegon, Noah Lyles and Femke Bol are among the global stars in action.

Watch the Silesia Diamond League action on BBC Two, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app from 15:00-17:00 BST on Friday.

As Hodgkinson's race is not part of the Diamond League programme, it will take place before TV coverage begins - but replays will be available on BBC platforms.

The Diamond League final will be held in Zurich for the first time since 2022

The 16th Diamond League season is under way as athletics' Olympic stars build towards their shot at world glory in 2025.

Athletes compete for points in 32 disciplines in a bid to qualify for the finals in Zurich in August.

That takes place just over a fortnight before the start of the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, Japan.

All Diamond League events will be shown on the BBC, which has agreed a deal to broadcast the competition for the next five years.

It is also the first year in which the Diamond League must compete with Michael Johnson's new Grand Slam Track for athletes' attention.

However, there has been only one direct clash between the two competitions - with the Miami Slam on 2-4 May taking place at the same time as the meet in Keqiao, China on 3 May.

The Diamond League has increased its prize money to a total of $9.24m (Â£6.95m) across the series.

That includes $500,000 (Â£375,000) at each of the 14 series meetings, and $2.2m (Â£1.7m) at the Diamond League final.

Athletes will compete for points at the 14 regular series meetings which started in April and run through to August. 

Points are awarded on a scale from eight for first place to one for eighth place. 

After the 14th meeting in Brussels, the top six ranked athletes in the field events, the top eight in track events from 100m up to 800m, and the top 10 in the distances from 1500m upwards qualify for the finals. 

The two-day finals are a winner-takes-all competition to be crowned Diamond League champion in each event.

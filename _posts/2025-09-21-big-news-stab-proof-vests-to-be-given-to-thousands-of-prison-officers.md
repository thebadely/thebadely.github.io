According to new developments, Justice Secretary David Lammy has announced 10,000 more prison officers will be given body armour in a bid to improve safety in jails after several high-profile attacks. 

Lammy said he was determined to "restore tough law and order" and "ensure prisons are fit for purpose" during a visit to Belmarsh prison in south-east London. 

The new equipment is part of a Â£15m boost in funding, which will also include 500 Tasers for trained staff.

The move comes after three prison officers were taken to hospital after they were allegedly attacked with hot oil and makeshift weapons at HMP Frankland in April.

Included in the new gear will be protective vests for every prison guard working in high-security facilities.

Lammy said the new investment sent a clear message of support to the country's prison officers.

"Our dedicated prison officers put themselves in harm's way every day to protect us," he said.

"This new investment sends a clear message: we back our staff and we will give them the tools they need to do their jobs safely."

Manchester Arena bomb plotter Hashem Abedi has been charged with attempting to murder prison officers in HMP Frankland and is due to appear in court on 25 September.

The independent reviewer of terrorism legislation Jonathan Hall KC has been appointed to investigate the alleged attack and make recommendations to improve safety for frontline officers.

Lammy said it was "horrific" what "good people" who signed up to being a prison officer were subjected to.

"I recognise that, one, I'd like to see the number of prison officers increase, and we're only going to achieve that if prison officers feel secure, and there is a cohort of violent, pernicious prisoners with malevolent intent," he said.

"I think I'm hoping, under my watch, we'll see stability in the system, so we won't need emergency measures."

Conservative shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick welcomed the move, saying "frontline officers have been left exposed for far too long".

"They cannot afford more delays - this equipment needs to reach them immediately," he added.

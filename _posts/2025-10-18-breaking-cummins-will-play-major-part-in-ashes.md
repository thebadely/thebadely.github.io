It has been recently reported that Pat Cummins has taken 309 wickets in 71 Test matches at an average of 22.10

Australia captain Pat Cummins will play a "major part" in this winter's Ashes series against England, says chair of selectors George Bailey.

There had been speculation the 32-year-old could miss the series because of a back stress problem which had not yet healed.

Australia's camp previously indicated no call has been made on Cummins' participation, with the five-Test series starting on 21 November in Perth.

Bailey said Cummins is "building up" and was "optimistic" about his chances.

"We know time is getting short and there's permutations around that, not just around the back, but other factors as well," Bailey said.

"It's positive. [We are] really confident that he's going to play a major part. Hopefully it's the first Test. If not, then we'll pick it up."

Cummins was ruled out of Australia's limited-overs series against New Zealand and India last month after scans revealed a lumbar bone stress in his back.

He has a history of back injuries, with flare-ups in 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2015-16 causing him to miss three Australian summers in four years.

He said he would be "aggressive" and "take risks" in his recovery in order to play in the Ashes.

Bailey said he did not know if Cummins had begun bowling as part of his rehabilitation but that it was "getting tight" for him to be fit for the first Test.

Should Cummins not be fit in time for the opener in Perth, former captain Steve Smith will skipper the side.

All-rounder Cameron Green was recently pulled out of Australia's squad for their one-day international series against India as a precaution because of soreness in his side.

Bailey described it as a "minor" injury and said Green will play in the Sheffield Shield, so will be "in a good place to be ready to bowl".

"We put so much time and energy into building out the plan for him to be available for the first Test as an all-rounder," Bailey said.

"He was only going to play the first two ODIs anyway. The way he swings the cricket bat in white-ball cricket, even if it just sets him back for 24 more hours, we just made the decision to approach this more conservatively."

It has been recently reported that Sititi only made his Super Rugby debut in March 2024, but has quickly become a key part of the All Blacks side

Quilter Nations Series: England v New Zealand

Venue: Allianz Stadium, Twickenham Date: Saturday, 15 November Kick-off: 15:10 GMT

New Zealand have named star back row Wallace Sititi among their replacements as they attempt to keep enough quality in reserve to counter England's stacked 'Pom Squad' bench.

Sititi, 23, was named as World Rugby's breakthrough player of 2024 and set up Mark Tele'a for a try as the starting blindside flanker in the All Blacks 24-22 win at Allianz Stadium last autumn.

He came off the bench to score a try as the All Blacks acclerated away from Ireland in the final quarter of their 26-13 win in Chicago a fortnight ago.

The experience of Anton Lienert-Brown and Damian McKenzie, the scorer of the decisive try in last weekend's win over Scotland, is also ready to be unleashed in the second half.

England's bench, named on Tuesday, contains six British and Irish Lions, including forwards Ellis Genge, Luke Cowan-Dickie and Tom Curry.

England coach Steve Borthwick has focused on ensuring his team finish matches strongly after they faded out of a number of tight contests last season.

Simon Parker wins his seventh cap in place of Sititi, bringing a physical, direct style to the starting back row, while captain Scott Barrett returns in the second row after missing the win at Murrayfield with a cut to his leg.

Elsewhere, Leicester Fainga'anuku shifts to the wing in place of the injured Caleb Clarke, with Billy Proctor coming into midfield. 

Beauden Barrett continues at fly-half, with Will Jordan, five tries short of Doug Howlett's all-time All Blacks record, at full-back.

There is no place in the matchday 23 for Leinster-bound back Rieko Ioane.

Dutch-born Holland to make All Blacks debut

Hooker Codie Taylor and open-side flanker Ardie Savea, both Test centurions, are Barrett's vice-captains, while Netherlands-born Fabian Holland, who was inspired by the visit of a New Zealand Sevens side to his local club as an 11-year-old and moved to New Zealand five years later, is at lock.

England have won their last nine games, but have emerged victorious only once in their last 11 meetings with the All Blacks. 

New Zealand are attempting a clean sweep of Britain and Ireland, having overcome Ireland and Scotland and with a tour-ending clash against Wales on 22 November.

"Recent games against England have been incredibly close-fought, and both teams are coming off a run of wins, so we are expecting an epic clash on Saturday afternoon," said coach Scott Robertson.

"We will embrace the atmosphere and the occasion."

New Zealand: Jordan; Carter, Proctor, Tupaea, Fainga'anuku; B Barrett, Roigard, De Groot, Taylor (vc), Newell, S Barrett (c), Holland, Parker, Savea (vc), Lakai

Replacements: Taukei'aho, Williams, Tosi, Lord, Sititi, Ratima, Lienert-Brown, McKenzie

Here’s what you need to know: Maddy Cusack became Sheffield United women's record appearance holder

Sheffield United have denied deliberately delaying the inquest into the death of their former women's team captain Maddy Cusack.

Cusack died suddenly aged 27 in September 2023, with police saying the circumstances were not considered suspicious.

Afterwards, her family claimed that pressure had been put on Cusack by "processes and conduct" at Sheffield United, including allegations over the behaviour of former manager Jonathan Morgan.

Her inquest was originally scheduled for April last year, before being rearranged for this month.

But on Monday at Chesterfield Coroners Court, the process was pushed back until 29 June.

Lawyers representing the Cusack family said that "it is extremely disappointing" that Sheffield United provided 699 pages of documents just before Christmas, having originally been given a late November deadline.

The new documents include a statement from Cheryl Anderson, the club's head of safeguarding.

Dean Armstrong KC, representing the Cusacks, told the court: "The family found themselves, already at the most difficult time in their lives, having to try and get to grips with 700 pages of material a week before Christmas for a hearing the first day after the Christmas break. 

"We deem that unacceptable. It has had an impact on them."

Joseph O'Brien KC, on behalf of Sheffield United, replied: "The complaints are wholly misplaced. We reject entirely any suggestion of non-compliance. 

"We have made strenuous efforts to make sure information was sent to relevant parties. The suggestion we have in some way contributed to the adjournment by non-compliance is wholly without merit."

The coroner added that court procedures and the need to make redactions to documents had contributed to the delay.

Tributes were paid to Cusack at Sheffield United's Bramall Lane stadium following her death

An investigation commissioned by Sheffield United in the aftermath of Cusack's death found no evidence of wrongdoing, but the Football Association launched its own investigation to establish whether "further action is required under our jurisdiction within football".

Last year, the family raised concerns that significant portions of Sheffield United's submissions and the FA's final report had been redacted, preventing the family and their lawyers from accessing them.

Legal representatives for both Sheffield United and the FA insisted they had acted in accordance with legal principles.

On Monday, after the Cusacks' lawyers reaffirmed their wish for the redactions to be reassessed, coroner Sophie Cartwright gave Sheffield United seven days to make any submissions on the matter.

Cartwright subsequently addressed the family, saying: "You've been in my thoughts particularly over the Christmas period. Can I apologise to you, for the delay in bringing the inquest into Maddy's death to a conclusion. I wish you well."

In autumn last year, Cusack's sister Olivia discussed the impact of the inquest delays, telling BBC Newsbeat: "It's the biggest thing that's ever happened in my life and you have no control over how that is dealt with.

"You want to think of her at peace and that she's OK.

"But it's hard to picture her at peace now when there's so much chaos surrounding her death."

Cusack's parents and two of her siblings attended the hearing in Chesterfield

The full collection of documents to be used in the inquest totals more than 1,000 pages, while more than 20 witnesses are set to be called to give evidence.

Morgan, who also coached Cusack during her one season at Leicester City, had previously complained at a hearing last summer that witnesses put forward by the family were "one-sided" and requested the addition of others who would put forward the "opposite view".

At that previous hearing, lawyers representing the Cusack family alleged there was a "climate of concern and fear" at Sheffield United in the period leading up to the footballer's death.

And it heard that one witness alleged Morgan had labelled one of his own players "cancerous".

Sheffield United sacked Morgan in February 2024, citing "new information" concerning his behaviour with players at previous clubs.

Morgan also had his contract terminated with the agency who represented him, who referred to "a relationship with a player under his charge" before he joined the Blades.

Morgan will appear in person representing himself during the inquest, which is scheduled to run for two weeks.

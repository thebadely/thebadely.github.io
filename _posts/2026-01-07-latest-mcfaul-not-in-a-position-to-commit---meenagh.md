Experts revealed that Ciaran McFaul is unlikely to feature for Derry in 2026

Derry manager Ciaran Meenagh has confirmed Ciaran McFaul "is not in a position to commit" to the Oak Leaf panel for 2026. 

McFaul came on as a second-half substitute in Derry's 2023 Ulster final win over Armagh, scoring the winning penalty in the shoot-out. 

The Glen man also won an All-Ireland with his club in 2024, and has been one of the county's most consistent performers over the last decade. 

"Ciaran McFaul is not in a position to commit this year, so he's not part of the panel," Meenagh told BBC Sport NI after his side's 2-16 0-7 win over Antrim in the Dr McKenna Cup. 

Derry defender Eoin McEvoy will return to action later in the year after a return from injury.

In a further boost, two of Slaughtneil's stars have returned following their club's run to the All-Ireland club hurling semi-final where they lost out to Loughrea in December. 

"Eoin McEvoy is part of the panel, he's just coming back from a wee bit of tendinopathy in the knee and he's making unbelievable progress. He's chomping at the bit and ready to go, so I'm looking forward to having him back soon," Meenagh continued. 

"The Slaughtneil boys are back in training now. Brendan (Rogers) and Shane (McGuigan) are back this week there.

"So, we have everybody else fit. We've not had a pile of injuries outside of that, we're in a pretty healthy position now." 

Derry's opening McKenna Cup game against Donegal last weekend was called off due to the recent cold snap, with the counties each awarded a point, meaning their group campaign has come to an end. 

They'll have to await the outcome of Sunday's game between Antrim and Donegal to see if they top their section, or qualify for next Wednesday night's semi-finals as the best runner-up. 

The Dr McKenna Cup schedule is tight with the final coming just three days after the semi-finals.

"We want that game next Wednesday night. We were desperate for that game today," Meenagh stressed.

"We probably haven't played the same number of challenge games around the country that other teams have.

"I don't necessarily believe in that, but we have a good squad here. We play football in training every night, but you just need that wee bit of chemistry, that wee bit of cohesion, not playing in a pitch like this that's properly stewarded, properly officiated. 

"So, we've got the good out of that tonight, but we need the game next Wednesday."

According to new developments, Sophie Ecclestone has taken 137 wickets in 96 T20s for England

England have recalled left-arm spinner Sophie Ecclestone for their five-match T20 series against India.

It was announced last Saturday that Ecclestone, 26, would be taking a break from domestic cricket to "prioritise her wellbeing" and recover from a quad injury, but England hoped she would return for the first game against India from 28 June.

The Lancashire bowler missed England's dominant T20 and ODI series wins over West Indies in May and early June as she recovered from a knee injury sustained at the Women's Premier League in India in February. 

She played two one-day matches and six T20s for Lancashire before picking up the quad injury and taking the break. 

The India series, which sees three one-day internationals follow the T20s, will be the first time Ecclestone has represented England since January's 16-0 Ashes defeat in Australia. 

During that series Ecclestone refused to take part in a TV interview conducted by former team-mate Alex Hartley, following her criticism of England's fitness during the T20 World Cup in November.

Ecclestone, who is fourth in the ICC's T20 bowler rankings, replaces leg-spinner Sarah Glenn in a 14-player squad for the India, with the series England's last before the 50-over World Cup in India and Sri Lanka from late September.

England's T20 squad to face India: Nat Sciver-Brunt (captain), Em Arlott, Tammy Beaumont, Lauren Bell, Alice Capsey, Charlie Dean, Sophia Dunkley, Sophie Ecclestone, Lauren Filer, Amy Jones, Paige Scholfield, Linsey Smith, Danni Wyatt-Hodge, Issy Wong.

England head coach Charlotte Edwards said: "It's great to have Soph back, and we're looking forward to having her back in the group. She has obvious qualities and she'll be an asset to us.

"It does mean Sarah Glenn misses out, we are blessed with a strong group of spinners and we unfortunately can't play them all. 

"It's now a great opportunity for Sarah to go back to The Blaze and play some competitive cricket in the Vitality Blast."

England will announce a squad for the three one-day internationals that start on 16 July at a later date.

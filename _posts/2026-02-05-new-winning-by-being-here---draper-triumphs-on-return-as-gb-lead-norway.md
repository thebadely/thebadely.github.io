Draper cruises to Davis Cup win on return from injury

Jack Draper says he is "winning by being here" as he made an emphatic return after a lengthy injury lay-off to help Great Britain take control of their Davis Cup qualifying tie against Norway.

British number one Draper has spent five months on the sidelines with a bruised bone in his service arm.

His comeback was delayed twice by the injury and he missed January's Australian Open to complete his recovery.

However, he served well, moved sharply and showed some brutal ball-striking to bear Viktor Durasovic 6-2 6-2 in his first competitive match for 164 days.

Sterner tests will await world number 13 Draper, who is ranked 300 places above Durasovic, but he will be relieved to have rattled through a convincing win after a long spell out.

"Tennis is a bubble, and sometimes you can get distracted that it's all that matters in life," the 24-year-old told BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller.

"When you have time out, I used it wisely I think to try and make sure that when I try and come back to tennis, that I'm ready to go all the way again."

"I'm confident that I'm on a really good path. I'm winning by being here."

Cameron Norrie then gave Britain a 2-0 lead with a characteristically gritty 6-4 6-4 win over teenager Nicolai Budkov Kjaer.

Lloyd Glasspool and Julian Cash can wrap up the best-of-five tie for Britain at the earliest opportunity if they triumph in Friday's doubles.

If not, Draper and Norrie will have to take to the court again for the reverse singles.

The winner of the tie in Oslo will face either Australia or Ecuador for a place in November's eight-team Finals.

Jack Draper had not played competitively since the US Open first round on 25 August

Englishman Draper said he had "lots of dark moments" during the injury lay-off that disrupted his breakout season.

Draper had won the prestigious Masters 1,000 title at Indian Wells and reached the fourth round of the Australian and French Opens before being impacted by the injury in his left arm.

He suffered a second-round exit at Wimbledon and played just one match after before ending his season early.

There were very few signs of rust against Durasovic, with Draper dropping just 10 points on serve, hitting eight aces and winning 88% of first-serve points.

He produced three glorious passing shots - two off the backhand and one off the forehand - and moved well behind the baseline to suffocate Durasovic.

He went a quick break up in both sets and did not face a single break point.

Draper was only taken to deuce once, and that was when he served for the match at 5-2 up in the second. A thumping forehand and a long backhand from his opponent was enough to help the Briton wrap up victory in only 61 minutes.

"I definitely have to be wary of how the injury is progressing," Draper added.

"I wouldn't be back playing again if me and my team weren't really confident that I can start to build back on the tour again.

"I definitely have to be sensible at times."

Norrie later came back from a 4-1 second-set deficit to see off world number 133 Budkov Kjaer.

Budkov Kjaer, a former Wimbledon junior champion, converted just one of his four break opportunities against Norrie.

Draper looked sharp on his return and there was little sign of rust in what turned out to be a very gentle stroll past Durasovic.

The 24-year-old had support from a vast travelling Lawn Tennis Association team as well as his new coach Jamie Delgado.

Personal coaches do not usually travel to Davis Cup ties, but this was the first chance Delgado has had to see Draper in action since succeeding James Trotman in the autumn.

Draper and Delgado are scheduled to head to Rotterdam after this tie for the British number one's return to the ATP Tour. 

How much to play, and how often to rest, will be a delicate balance to strike over the next few months.

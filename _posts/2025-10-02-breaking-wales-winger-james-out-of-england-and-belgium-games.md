Let's dive into the details: Winger Dan James has scored eight goals in 59 games for Wales

International friendly: England v Wales

Venue: Wembley Stadium, London Date: Thursday, 9 October Kick off: 19:45 BST

Coverage: Live on S4C, BBC Radio Wales, Radio Cymru, BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds, the BBC Sport website and app, plus live text commentary.

Dan James has been ruled out of Wales' October double-header against England and Belgium through injury.

The winger, 27, is expected to be out for four to six weeks after rolling his ankle in training, according to his Leeds United manager Daniel Farke.

Farke said on Thursday that he expects James back after the November international break, calling it a "bonus and surprise" if the player can return before then.

Wales face England in a friendly at Wembley on Thursday, 9 October before hosting Belgium in a World Cup qualifier at Cardiff City Stadium the following Monday.

Leeds still provide three players to Wales head coach Craig Bellamy's squad, with Karl Darlow, Joe Rodon and Ethan Ampadu called up.

While the injury to James is a blow, Bellamy can still call on the Premier League trio of Brennan Johnson (Tottenham Hotspur), David Brooks (Bournemouth) and Harry Wilson (Fulham) for the wide attacking positions, while Stoke City's Sorba Thomas has also impressed at international level.

Wales have yet to call up a replacement to the squad for 59-times-capped James.

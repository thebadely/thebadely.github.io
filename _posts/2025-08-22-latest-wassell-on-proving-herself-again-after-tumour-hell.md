Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Emma Wassell spent two weeks in hospital after having the benign tumour removed in September 2024

Emma Wassell has been blown away be the mountain of goodwill she has received since announcing last year she required surgery to remove a tumour from her chest. Now she wants to remind everyone what a terrific rugby player she is.

Her Scotland team-mates wrapped their arms around Wassell and helped her along the road to recovery. The outpouring of support from the Scottish rugby community, the wider game and beyond the sport was a comfort in bleak times.

Having battled back to fitness in time for Scotland beginning their World Cup campaign against Wales in Salford on Saturday, Wassell wants to move on from the dark times and make more happy memories in a Scotland shirt.

"We joke a lot about it. I say 'I do actually play rugby, I didn't just have a tumour. There's more to me, I swear'," Wassell says on the BBC's Scotland Rugby Podcast.

"I don't want anyone to think any differently other than she's a pretty good rugby player."

The 30-year-old spent two weeks in hospital after having the benign tumour removed in September 2024.

It was a traumatic time, coming just months after the loss of her mother, and Wassell has spoken movingly of how her "rugby family" rallied around her in her most difficult moment.

Her participation in the World Cup may not have been uppermost in her mind in those initial days post-surgery, but it soon became a goal that would drive her recovery.

"There's been parts of the journey that I've kind of just thought, I just want to get back playing rugby and enjoying rugby again, but you know that carrot is there dangling," said the second row.

"It's the World Cup in England, which is the closest I'll get to a home World Cup and just knowing that you can have all your friends and family there to support.

"It was a huge goal of mine and it definitely pushed me. There was various moments where I had to dig a little deeper and just think 'are you wanting to go to that World Cup or not, Emma?'.

"It pushed me when I probably needed a wee push and I'm just incredibly excited and grateful that I've made it."

Having played in two warm-up fixtures against Italy and Ireland, Wassell feels physically back to her best.

The initial steps back into physical contact were not easy, however, and there were brief moments of doubt as to whether her body was ready for the demands of Test rugby.

"There was definitely a huge mental element to it just because it was my chest and that's something when you're playing rugby, it is going to get hit, whether it is being tackled, tackling or just landing on the ball," Wassell said.

"Your sternum is taking an impact. So there was a lot around kind of just growing confidence there, but I reflect on after it happened and there was moments when I was coming back and I'm like, am I ever going to have the confidence to throw my body about again?

"There was a moment in time that I couldn't really push myself off the ground. I really struggled and it was maybe four weeks that I was really weak.

"It was quite a daunting thought coming back to a full contact sport. And for me, it isn't really about just getting back to full contact sport, it's full contact sport at international level.

"I think I've only had one contact session where I had a wee cry. It was the first proper hit to my chest and I was fine, but I got a fright and I think I needed to do that. And it was in training. I was at the right stage of training to be doing that.

"But I got a shock and I got a scare and I almost had to feel it and realise I'm fine. I'm absolutely fine.

"I had a wee cry and then it was about just taking a couple of days and then back into it. And then I realised, OK, it's on, we're ready."

It will be Wassell's second World Cup and while the feeling of reaching the last one in 2022 and ending Scotland's 12-year absence from the tournament was thrilling, the regrets at exiting at the pool stage are still raw.

"If I'm being honest, since that last World Cup, I have only ever really thought of this one," she said.

"There is regret there from the last World Cup and that stings. To carry it with you for three years, you realise you now have another opportunity and it might be your last.

"So it's so easy to say we want to go out there and give our best performance, which we absolutely do, but it's about winning.

"It's about making every moment count. In a World Cup, it's about converting. It's about winning.

"I don't care how we win, I just want to win."

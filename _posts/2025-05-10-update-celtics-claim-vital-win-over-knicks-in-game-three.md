Experts revealed that Jayson Tatum hit 22 points for the Celtics

The Boston Celtics dominated the New York Knicks in game three to cut the deficit to 2-1 in their NBA Eastern Conference play-off semi-final.

The Celtics blew 20-point third-quarter leads in the first two games of the best-of-seven series in Boston as the Knicks mounted stunning comebacks against the reigning NBA champions.

But the visitors made no mistake in New York, moving into a 71-46 lead at half-time and remaining ruthless to see out a vital victory.

The Celtics rediscovered their three-point shooting ability that deserted them in the first two games, hitting 50% of their shots from beyond the arc in Madison Square Garden.

Payton Pritchard led the Celtics with 23 points, while star Jayson Tatum added 22. Jalen Brunson hit a game-high 27 points for the Knicks.

"I don't think we came with the mindset of being satisfied, but I think it was just subconsciously satisfied being up 2-0," Brunson said. "Just not the way we need to approach the game."

Game four is in New York on Monday.

Anthony Edwards scored a game-high 36 points as the Minnesota Timberwolves moved into a 2-1 series lead over the Golden State Warriors.

Edwards scored three three-pointers in the fourth quarter as the Timberwolves came from behind to claim a 102-97 victory.

It means the Timberwolves could have the opportunity to win the series at home next Wednesday, should they take game four on Monday.

"We're just winning the possession battle in clutch time now," Timberwolves coach Chris Finch said.

"We're not giving the ball back on cheap turnovers. We're not giving up as many or any second-chance opportunities."

Warriors coach Steve Kerr added: "The team defence was really good, held them to 102. That's a pretty good number. We couldn't quite contain them, especially in the fourth, and that was the difference."

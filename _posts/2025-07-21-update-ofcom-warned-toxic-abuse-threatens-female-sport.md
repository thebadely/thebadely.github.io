Let's dive into the details: Sport England wants to know how Ofcom intends to tackle online trolls

The head of Sport England has written to Ofcom, the communications industry regulator, to express its "deep concern regarding the recent wave of racist and sexist abuse" directed at England's women's football team on social media.

Chris Boardman, the chairman of the community sport funding agency, said "the toxic culture that persists online threatens to undermine" efforts to increase rates of female participation.

Lionesses defender Jess Carter has revealed she has been targeted with online racist abuse throughout the tournament.

In a letter seen by BBC Sport, Boardman warned: "This behaviour is abhorrent and unacceptable in any context, but it is especially disheartening given the progress we have made in championing women and girls in sport.

"Through Sport England and National Lottery investment, we have committed hundreds of millions of pounds to increase participation, visibility and opportunity for women and girls in sport."

In October 2023, the Online Safety Act became law, ensuring social media platforms have a duty to protect users from content such as racism, with Ofcom responsible for enforcing the legislation, and developing codes of practice to guide tech companies. However, some anti-racism campaigners believe there needs to be more urgency.

"The Online Safety Act 2023 provides a framework to address illegal and harmful content, including hate speech and misogynistic abuse," wrote Boardman.

"We are particularly interested in how the new codes can be used to address the kind of targeted abuse we are seeing. We understand that Ofcom has also issued draft guidance on improving online safety for women and girls, and we would welcome the opportunity to discuss how these measures can be strengthened and enforced.

"For too long, internet trolls have been given free rein by the big tech companies to spread bile and misery, and this cannot be allowed to continue.

"Could you please advise what further steps can be taken within the current regulatory framework to tackle misogyny and racism online?"

Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy told BBC Sport that social media companies and Ofcom "need to do more".

"I think the act will continue to be tested every time a problem surfaces and it's incumbent on those such as Ofcom and social media platforms to be proactive in rooting this out," she said.

"We brought in the Online Harms Act this year to make sure there are sanctions for companies that don't take this content down and we are doing a lot of work in schools to educate young people about the impact of online abuse but it's incumbent on all of us to call this out.

"It's absolutely disgraceful what [Jess Carter] has had to put up with and we are completely behind her and the Lionesses."

Ofcom has been approached for comment.

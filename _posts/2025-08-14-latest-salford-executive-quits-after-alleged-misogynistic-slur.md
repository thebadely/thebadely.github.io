Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Salford Red Devils have lost 19 of their 21 Super League games this season

Salford Red Devils chief operating officer Claire Bradbury has quit her role at the troubled Super League outfit and alleged the club's ownership suggested she "sleep with someone at the Rugby Football League" to ease their situation.

She joined Salford in October 2024 after more than three years working at Premiership rugby side Sale Sharks - but has resigned after less than a year with the Red Devils.

Salford have said they "condemn inappropriate language and behaviour" and will be conducting "a thorough internal investigation" into Bradbury's allegations.

"It's important to share something more personal, as a senior woman in business," Bradbury posted on networking site LinkedIn, external in relation to her resignation.

"Misogynistic, inappropriate language from the ownership suggesting I sleep with an individual at the RFL to 'smooth things over' is not acceptable.

"At the time I stayed quiet because I wanted the club to succeed. 

"I'm disappointed in myself that I didn't stand up to it then so I'm voicing it now as it should be heard for the integrity and evolution of rugby league, and for all women who work in sport."

An RFL spokesperson told Sky Sports News: "Any language and suggestion of this kind is clearly offensive and unacceptable."

In response to Bradbury's allegations, a supporters' group - The 1873 - has called off a planned meeting with the club's ownership.

A "peaceful protest march" to the ground before Sunday's fixture with Wakefield Trinity is still going ahead and they have now invited "all rugby league fans to stand with us".

Responding to Bradbury's claims, Salford's statement said: "It has been alleged by a former member of the Salford Red Devils staff, who departed the club on 12 August 2025, that she was subjected to inappropriate verbal conduct by the owners of the club.

"Salford Red Devils unequivocally condemns any and all forms of inappropriate language and behaviour. We treat such allegations with the utmost seriousness and are committed to ensuring that our club environment remains respectful, professional, and safe for all members of staff.

"In response to these allegations, we will be conducting a thorough internal investigation. We are determined to establish the facts and take any necessary action to address the situation. We will provide a detailed report of our findings as soon as the investigation is concluded."

Salford, who were taken over by a consortium just before the start of the season, have had a number of financial issues this year, leading to the vast majority of their senior players leaving and the struggling side bottom of Super League.

Earlier on Thursday, prior to Bradbury's resignation, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham told BBC Radio Manchester he had been "watching the situation very closely".

After last Sunday's dismal 80-6 defeat at Hull FC, where five players made their debuts and some of the squad only met for the first time on the bus to the game, the owners issued a statement on Monday to say the club would not close despite their ongoing problems.

Bradbury said she and her colleagues had been left working in "impossible" conditions and the "club's soul was being ripped out".

"My decision to resign was not taken lightly," she added.

"It is heartbreaking, but I cannot continue in a role where, in my view, the foundations needed for professional success are not in place, and where trust between leadership and staff has been eroded."

Scorecard; Table

Captain Joe Burns said it was "special moment" when he realised Italy had qualified for the T20 World Cup for the first time despite suffering a nerve-shredding nine-wicket defeat to the Netherlands.

The result simultaneously ended Jersey's hopes of progressing to the tournament in India and Sri Lanka next year as the Dutch finished top of the standings at the European Qualifier in The Hague.

Italy finished level on five points with the Channel Islanders, who beat Scotland in a last-ball thriller earlier in the day, but secured second spot thanks to a superior net run rate (+0.612) compared to Jersey's (+0.306).

The Italians batted first and their 134-7 meant the Netherlands would have to chase down their total in the 15th over for Jersey to qualify.

That initially appeared unlikely on a pitch which had looked tricky for batting.

However, the Dutch made a flying start to the chase as Michael Levitt and Max O'Dowd put on 71 for the first wicket in 7.3 overs causing Italian hearts to flutter.

Italy's spinners Ben Manenti (0-25) and Crishan Kalugamage (1-25) managed to settle the nerves for the Azzurri during the middle overs as they stemmed the run rate with some tight bowling.

Jersey's players watched from the pavilion hoping the Dutch could continue their assault but were left crestfallen when O'Dowd and Scott Edwards could not score the requisite number of runs off the 15th over bowled by Kent's Grant Stewart.

The Dutch eventually got home in 16.2 overs as O'Dowd finished unbeaten on 47 off 42 balls while Edwards made 37 not out. 

"This is obviously a very special moment for us," Burns said. "We are trying to make people proud, trying to create a legacy for Italians going forward.

"It's a very similar story for everyone in our group, our families have sacrificed a lot going back a few generations.

"This group of men will leave a legacy for future generations which is really special."

Italy and the Netherlands join England and Ireland as Europe's other representatives at the T20 World Cup.

Opening batter Joe Burns played 23 Tests for Australia between 2014 and 2020

Italy skipper Burns said before the tournament his side "had the players" to reach their first major global ICC event.

After a shock victory over Scotland, a shot at history was within their grasp and Burns decided their best hope was to bat first after he wont the toss at Voorburg Cricket Club.

The Azzurri suffered a huge setback when Durham batter Emilio Gay, who made a fifty in their win over the Scots, was trapped lbw by Aryan Dutt for six.

Burns steadied the ship as he took Italy to 41-2 in six overs with a 21-ball 22 only to slog sweep Roelof van der Merwe into the hands of Bas de Leede in the deep.

Then when Marcus Campopiano departed for two Italy looked in a bit of trouble at 46-4 only for the Manenti brothers - Ben and Harry - to come to the rescue with a 45-run stand for the fifth wicket.

Some late hitting from Stewart, who whacked two sixes off the penultimate over from Bas de Leede, and Anthony Mosca got Italy to what appeared a competitive total.

The Dutch had other ideas and rather than cruise to victory they took an attacking approach as Levitt and O'Dowd pummelled Italy seamers Thomas Draca, Harry Manenti and Stewart.

Burns turned to his spinners and they brought the necessary control to take the sting out of the Dutch reply and keep their run rate above Jersey's.

"Obviously after the powerplay the game was gone and we're playing for a place at the World Cup," Burns added.

"Our spinners, as they have done all tournament, bowled the house down. To throw the ball to them in those key moments was great. Hopefully those wickets in Sri Lanka and India turn!"

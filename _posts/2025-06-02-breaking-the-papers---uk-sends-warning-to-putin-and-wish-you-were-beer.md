Experts revealed that Many of the papers focus on the government's strategic defence review. The Telegraph claims it's in "disarray" because it says the defence secretary has "backtracked" on a pledge to boost military spending to 3% of GDP by 2034. 

The Daily Mail says Labour has been accused of an "embarrassing U-turn" - and urges the government to not "leave us defenceless". The Times is also concerned. Its leader column accuses ministers of "strategic delusion" - warning that "for 30 years, Britain has failed to match funding with geopolitical ambition".

The Guardian notes that Labour's push towards increased militarisation "may not be enthusiastically greeted by many of the party's supporters" - but says the government is hoping to win support by arguing the investment will create skilled jobs, particularly outside London.

The front pages of the Times and the Telegraph include details of Ukraine's daring drone attack on Russian bombers yesterday. Both papers feature similar images of an aircraft being hit. The Guardian calls it a "spectacular attack" - while the Financial Times says the "audacious" strike took more than a year to plan.

The Express splashes on the record number of migrants who crossed the English Channel on Saturday - prompting the Conservatives to brand it a "day of shame". It claims that the defence secretary has admitted that boats were arriving like taxis. The Home Office says it has a serious plan to take down people smuggling networks at every stage.

A study - suggesting that exercise is better than drugs to keep cancer at bay - is highlighted by the Guardian and the Times. They report that a structured exercise routine given to advanced cancer patients after treatment was found to reduce the risk of dying from the disease. The results of the trial have been published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

The Mirror's front page celebrates the fifth anniversary of the organ donor opt out law in England. It features 17-year-old Max Johnson - whose life was saved when he received a heart from a nine-year-old car crash victim, Kiera Ball, when he was the same age. One Heart, Two Heroes, says the headline.

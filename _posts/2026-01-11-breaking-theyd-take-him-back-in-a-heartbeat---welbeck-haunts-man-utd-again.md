Welbeck scores as Brighton knock Man Utd out of FA Cup

This was supposed to be a day about a former Manchester United midfielder's return to Old Trafford - and help revive their fortunes.

In the end, it was one of their ex-strikers - and a former team-mate of interim United manager Darren Fletcher - who had cause for celebration.

As Fletcher's second game in charge ended in a disappointing defeat - following on from the Premier League draw at Burnley - Danny Welbeck returned to haunt his old club yet again and send Brighton through to the FA Cup fourth round.

The 35-year-old, who spent 13 years at his hometown club before joining Arsenal in 2014, was typically gracious about Fletcher, who left United as a player in 2015.

"He helped me massively as a young player at Man Utd," he said.

"It was nice to see him on the sidelines. I have the utmost respect for Darren Fletcher."

This may well be Fletcher's final match during his spell as United's interim manager. He is not the first to be hurt by Welbeck and may not be the last.

Having grown up in Longsight, less than five miles from Old Trafford, and come through the academy, Welbeck was part of the club's most recent Premier League title win under Sir Alex Ferguson in 2013.

He had struggled for minutes under manager Louis van Gaal, with the arrival of Colombian Radamel Falcao the final straw.

Since then Welbeck, who still takes Ferguson's calls like Fletcher, has made a habit of sending reminders to United managers and suits alike. 

He has now scored eight goals against United since leaving - the joint most he has scored against any club across his 17-year senior career.

When he did leave the pitch on Sunday he was applauded by all sides of Old Trafford - by those supporting players in red as well as blue and white.

"I remember Welbz when he first joined United and he was a terrific talent then," Phil Jones, another ex-team-mate of Welbeck and Fletcher, told BBC Sport.

"Should he have left Old Trafford? I think a lot of fans were sad to see him leave. You look now and I think they'd take him back in a heartbeat."

Welbeck also played a pivotal role in Brighton's opener, with his driving run and chipped cross resulting in Brajan Gruda's goal after Georginio Rutter's shot was blocked on the line by Patrick Dorgu.

In scoring his own 64th-minute goal, the man capped 42 times by England showed composure, skill and efficiency - often lacking at United since he left.

His first touch took Gruda's pass out of his feet, while his second placed the ball into the top left corner.

"I knew where the defenders are and I was like, 'I have to get a touch and the second touch has to be a shot on goal'," he told TNT Sports.

"It has to be a perfect touch, a little bit away from the defender. It was nice to get that clean connection."

Since leaving Manchester, the Gunners and a spell at Watford, Welbeck has played an increasingly senior role at Brighton, who he joined in 2020.

"To describe him best is to say that he is a role model on the pitch, beside it, a great connector," said Seagulls manager Fabian Hurzeler.

"He is a great goalscorer, he is there in the right moment. He missed a big chance but good goalscorers never give up, they are always ready."

Jones was similarly impressed by his performance.

"Today he was incredible," said the former England centre-back.

"The way he handles himself, the way he carries himself, the way he lives his life right and dedicates himself to football. 

"He epitomises that for any young kid watching, the way he goes about his work."

Welbeck turned 35 in November and this goal was his ninth this season.  

The 11 he scored in 2024-25 campaign was the most since his breakout year at Old Trafford in 2012 when he netted 12.  

"I can't give away the secret," he added when asked about his longevity.

Welbeck's goal meant Brighton had enough to progress despite Benjamin Sesko cutting the deficit late on

"I have good genetics. My mum and dad blessed me with good genes. 

"I work hard every single day. I eat well and prepare well for every single training session. 

"When I was younger I played left wing, right, number 10, as a nine, with experience playing the games, going through injuries, you come back and it is hard to get into the rhythm.

"Touch wood I have not had many injuries the last few years. Long may it continue."

The decisive goal at Old Trafford will also bring calls for Welbeck to make this summer's England squad at the World Cup back to the surface. 

The man himself, who won the last of his international caps in 2018, avoided getting involved in the chat.

"I am just focusing on the here and now," he added. "I know football can change at the click of your fingers."

But Jones and former United striker Dion Dublin were in no mood to rule it out.

"We keep talking about number nines but if there's anybody who can contribute as well as Harry Kane this summer, could he be that guy? He'd certainly be a pick for me," said Jones.

"He's still got all of the qualities, he's still strong, still quick and is scoring goals for fun at the minute."

Dublin added: "The only way you get on the plane as a centre-forward is if you're scoring goals at the time the squad is picked and you're doing exactly what the manager wants. 

"And as a centre-forward myself, his hold-up play's good, so that's fine. His link-up play's good, so he's bringing people in. 

"He doesn't mind the physical side of the game, he'll go back and defend corners as well - and he's getting goals. 

"So I don't know why he wouldn't be in the picture. Whether he goes or not, we don't know, but he's definitely given himself the best chance."

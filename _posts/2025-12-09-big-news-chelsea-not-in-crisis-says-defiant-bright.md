According to new developments, Bright has not featured in either of Chelsea's last two Women's Champions League games

Chelsea captain Millie Bright says the defending Women's Super League champions are not facing "a crisis" after Sunday's 1-0 loss to Everton.

A first league defeat in 585 days - since 1 May, 2024 and first under manager Sonia Bompastor - extended the Blues' WSL winless run to three games, following 1-1 draws with Arsenal and Liverpool. 

Those results left them six points behind leaders Manchester City after 10 matches.

Chelsea host Roma in the Women's Champions League on Wednesday and Bright said: "It's not a crisis, so we don't behave in any other way than if we'd won the game. 

"We go back out there, get training again, keep the morale up and stick together and bounce back. There's no time to dwell because we play in the Champions League."

Europe could prove a welcome distraction for Bright's side, although they still have work to do to qualify for the knockout rounds after winning two and drawing two of their four league phase games.

They are currently in sixth place in the standings, outside the top four by a point, with winless Roma third from bottom.

"There has probably been more noise from the outside like, 'wow, Chelsea lost a game', than from the inside," added Bright.

"We know where we are at, what we stand for and the qualities we have. We are all human.

"The games are getting harder and harder. Sometimes you have to give the opposition more credit, teams are getting better and it's harder to score, keep clean sheets and win. The gaps are getting closer and closer. 

"We never go into any game with the mentality to get anything other than three points and a good performance, but it happens. It's part of football."

Defender Bright, who retired from international duty with England in October, has been an unused substitute in three of Chelsea's last four games and was substituted at half-time in the other.

"No-one is going to enjoy spectating, it's not where you want to be as players," said the 32-year-old, when asked about watching games from the sidelines.

"It's a team sport, we have a very big squad with a lot of talent and depth. Everyone is fighting for their position, it's no different for any other individual.

"I know where I stand. That's the price you pay for playing for a top club with world-class players around you. Everyone is competing, no-one's position is secure, no matter what your role is in the team.

"With or without the [captain's] armband I will remain the same. My role doesn't change, coming in every day, my mentality to train. I want the team and my players to succeed. You have to do your duties, and I would do that, with or without the armband, anyway."

After facing Roma at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea will travel to Germany to play Wolfsburg in their final league phase match on Wednesday, 17 December.

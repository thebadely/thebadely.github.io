It has been recently reported that Chantelle Cameron (left) and Savannah Marshall are former undisputed champions

British duo Chantelle Cameron and Savannah Marshall have signed with Jake Paul's Most Valuable Promotions.

The United States-based promotion has been securing some of the world's best female boxers in recent months, signing the likes of Ellie Scotney, Ramla Ali and American Alycia Baumgardner.

"MVP represents the most dominant roster of UK women's athletes in boxing," said Paul and his MVP co-founder Nakisa Bidarian after the latest signings.

Both women are expected to make their promotional debuts on the undercard of Katie Taylor v Amanda Serrano 3, on 11 July in New York.

Cameron, 33, is a former undisputed champion at light-welterweight and is the only fighter who holds a win over Ireland's Katie Taylor in the professional ranks.

The Northampton fighter swapped Matchroom for Queensberry last year, but has now decided to part ways with Frank Warren in favour of YouTuber-turned-boxer Paul.

Marshall, 33, has not fought since 2023 when she became the then second undisputed boxing world champion from England, behind Cameron, by collecting all four super-middleweight world titles. 

The Hartlepool fighter has tried her hand at MMA with the PFL since then, and was previously with Ben Shalom's Boxxer.

Cameron and Marshall join a growing stable of female pound-for-pound greats at MVP, with Denmark's two-weight world champion Dina Thorslund recruited this year and seven-weight world champion Amanda Serrano leading the female faction.

Serrano takes on Taylor in their trilogy fight at Madison Square Garden, topping an all-women card with Scotney and Baumgardner set to defend their world titles.

Light-welterweight Cameron has spent the past year chasing a third fight with Taylor, and will be hopeful of fighting the winner of Taylor v Serrano 3 later this year.

Paul is a divisive figure in boxing, but continues to be one of the biggest draws in the sport.

The 28-year-old American has championed the female code through MVP, with Serrano and Taylor earning the biggest purse for female fighters in a bout which will be streamed on Netflix.

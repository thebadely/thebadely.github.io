Let's dive into the details: Novak Djokovic has not won a major title since his Olympic gold in Paris

Novak Djokovic will not take part in the Italian Open next week in another blow to the 24-time Grand Slam winner's preparations for Roland Garros.

Djokovic has competed in Rome in every season since 2007 and has won the event six times, most recently in 2022.

However organisers of the tournament announced on social media, external that the Serb will not play in 2025, with no reason given.

It follows Djokovic losing his opening match of the Madrid Open last week, and continues a troubled start to the year for the 37-year-old.

Djokovic, who is one victory from his 100th ATP title, has not won a major trophy so far this season, and his last title came during the 2024 Olympics in Paris.

The world number five has suffered early exits in two clay court tournaments in recent weeks, in Monte Carlo and Madrid.

After losing to Italy's Matteo Arnaldi in Spain, Djokovic hinted it could be his final appearance at the Madrid Open.

"It is kind of a new reality for me, I have to say, trying to win a match or two, not really thinking about getting far in the tournament," Djokovic said after his loss in Madrid.

His withdrawal from Rome means he is unlikely to play another competitive match before the French Open starts on May 26.

Djokovic has previously won three French Open titles.

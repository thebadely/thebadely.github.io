It has been recently reported that Rousey has not competed in the UFC since 2016

Ronda Rousey says no fighter is ever truly retired but has played down speculation she is training to return to the UFC.

The 38-year-old American has released a series of training footage videos on social media recently, prompting rumours she could be planning a comeback.

Rousey is regarded as a trailblazer in women's MMA, becoming the first UFC bantamweight champion in 2012 and defending her title six times.

But she has not fought since 2016 after losing to Amanda Nunes, revealing last year that concussions hindered the latter part of her career.

"They're like 'you look so good'. Because I'm the greatest ever," Rousey told American radio show The Breakfast Club. 

"Of course, this is what happens when I train - I look great. Sorry, I don't have to have a plan for world domination in mind.

"But Mike Tyson coming back and being the biggest fight of last year just kind of proves that I don't think anyone's ever really done."

Former boxing heavyweight champion Tyson ended his 19-year retirement to return to the ring at the age of 58, losing in a controversial bout with Jake Paul last year.

Rousey, who won judo Olympic bronze for the USA in 2008, dominated after transitioning to MMA when she won 12 of her 14 fights, with every win coming via stoppage.

She later revealed, however, that her aggressive style was a deliberate ploy in an attempt to finish fights early and limit the damage she took to her head.

'More than a fighter' - how Rousey finally found peace

After retiring from MMA, Rousey switched to the WWE in 2018 but has not performed for the sports entertainment wrestling organisation since 2023.

Last month, she dismissed the idea of ending her retirement to fight at the UFC's White House event next year, marking the 250th anniversary of America's founding.

Rousey, who had her second daughter earlier this year, says her return to training has been inspired by wanting to get her "bodily identity back".

"I think after having my last baby, being pregnant is tough," she said, adding that she no longer felt like "a finely tuned athletic machine".

"That's just where it started, I wanted to get my bodily identity back from just being a vessel for creating another person. Just get that freedom of movement back," she explained.

"I started training MMA again because I feel like I kind of lost that identity as being a fighter, I think it broke my heart too much to be anywhere near it because I love it so much.

"It makes me happy. It's really funny, I'm training and everyone's like 'what are you training for? What are you doing?' I'm like for my own joy. Is that bad?"

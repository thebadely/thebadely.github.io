Full leaderboard

Bryson DeChambeau ended a run of near misses by cruising to his first LIV Golf win of the season in South Korea.

The American started the final day with a four-shot lead and did not let up as he secured his first win at any tournament since last year's US Open.

The 31-year-old made six birdies on the back nine on Sunday to finish with a six-under 66 for a 19-under total.

That put him two shots ahead of compatriot Charles Howell III, who finished with a nine-under 63, with another American, Talor Gooch, three shots further back after a closing 66.

DeChambeau had endured three tough finishes over the past month, falling out of contention on the final day of the LIV events in Miami and Mexico City, as well as the Masters.

The two-time major winner finished fifth in Miami, in a tie for second in Mexico, and then tied for fifth as Rory McIlroy triumphed at Augusta.

But DeChambeau held his nerve on Sunday to claim his third LIV win overall and his first since September 2023.

"I've been playing great golf, just haven't gotten the job done," he said.

"That was a lot of tension and I'm glad I was able to step up to the plate and get it done."

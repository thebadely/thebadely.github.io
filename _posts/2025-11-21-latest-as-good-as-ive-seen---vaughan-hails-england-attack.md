England fight back as 19 wickets fall on incredible Ashes first day

England's pace barrage against Australia on day one of the Ashes series led to former captain Michael Vaughan saying "I would not want to face this attack on this pitch".

The tourists' five fast bowlers reduced Australia to 123-9 at the close in Perth after England had been skittled for 172.

Ben Stokes produced a superb six-over spell, taking five wickets for 23 runs after Jofra Archer and Brydon Carse had taken two wickets apiece to blow away the hosts' top order.

It meant England finished the day 49 runs ahead after a chaotic opening day that saw 19 wickets fall.

"I don't remember England bowling overs of this quality [before]," said Vaughan, who led England to an Ashes victory in 2005.

"The pacers have been consistent, they've been skilful, they've been quick. I admire this set of England bowlers hugely. 

"You've seen how this attack has had the top order jumping around. When you're a tailender and you're seeing someone who's incredibly talented like Cameron Green hit on the side of the grille... I would not want to face this attack on this pitch."

Of the wicket-taking balls delivered by England, only two were at stump height

England's average bowling speed of 87.6mph was their fastest on record and they combined pace with skill.

In the first 25 overs of their innings Australia were drawn into false shots from more than 40% of the deliveries they faced.

Since such data was collected (2006), that is the fifth-highest percentage of false shots drawn by any bowling team in Test cricket in the first 25 overs of an innings.

Stokes then took over with a five-wicket haul in just 36 balls - the fifth-fastest England bowler to five wickets in an innings.

"There was some brilliant bowling - there's a bit of movement and steep bounce on this Perth pitch," added Vaughan.

"You need bowlers to get you out of trouble and all five quick bowlers bowled with skill, pace and were intimidating.

"You can scar a team very early in a series. There were some good tactics by England and tactical manovures they'll take forward to the second innings and beyond.

"When England were 160-5, I thought go and get 250 because I have seen enough cricket here to know 250 is a good score in the first innings here.

"This pitch might flatten out a bit and the cracks might arrive but par isn't 350."

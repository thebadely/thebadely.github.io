Experts revealed that Hickey last played for Scotland in a 2-0 loss to Spain on 12 October 2023

Aaron Hickey is "good to go" for Scotland but head coach Steve Clarke will not overburden the full-back who returns to his squad after almost two years out.

The 23-year-old has been chosen for an away double-header against Denmark and Belarus next month as World Cup qualifying begins.

Hickey, capped 14 times, has appeared from the bench in Brentford's opening two Premier League games following major hamstring problems.

"He's good to go," Clarke said. "Whether he's good to go 90 minutes over two games is a different conversation. We'll manage him.

"He's been a long time out injured, and it was a difficult recovery process.

"He's a big player for us. It's up to everybody to manage him properly. We'll do that."

Ryan Christie, Ben Gannon-Doak and Lyndon Dykes are also back after significant injury breaks.

Is this first step of Clarke's last Scotland dance?

Hearts goalkeeper Zander Clark may be favourite to take the gloves, since Angus Gunn and Liam Kelly are second choice for Nottingham Forest and Rangers respectively.

Blackburn Rovers defender Dominic Hyam, capped once as a late substitute in June 2023, is recalled, while Lennon Miller, now at Udinese, retains his place after playing in summer friendlies against Iceland and Liechtenstein.

The inclusion of the 19-year-old means four of the eight midfielders listed are based in Serie A.

Kieron Bowie has started the season well for Hibernian and the 22-year-old striker gets another opportunity after making his debut as a substitute against Liechtenstein.

"I opened the squad up a little bit in the summer with some more younger ones just to give them a taste," explained Clarke.

"From the summer camp, only Kieron and Lennon have stayed in and around the scene. The rest of the boys have caught my eye.

"When I look at that squad, it's got a lot of good experience in it, players that know how to qualify for major tournaments and I'm hopeful we can do that again."

Scotland go to Copenhagen on 5 September and meet Belarus in Hungary three days later.

Greece are the other nation in Group C, with Clarke saying he was "excited for the challenge" of a six-game campaign over three months.

Only the group winners are guaranteed a place at the 2026 World Cup, which is being hosted by USA, Canada and Mexico, with Scotland bidding to qualify for the first time since 1998.

Hearts captain Lawrence Shankland is not included as Greg Taylor, Tommy Conway, Josh Doig, James Wilson, Nathan Patterson and Ryan Porteous also miss out.

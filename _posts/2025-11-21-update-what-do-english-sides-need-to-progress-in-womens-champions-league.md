Experts revealed that Four games down, two to go.

The Women's Champions League's inaugural league phase is set for a thrilling finale as teams battle to qualify for the knockout stage.

Last year's beaten finalists Barcelona are the frontrunners, with record eight-time winners Lyon in close pursuit at the top, while main draw debutants Manchester United lead the way for the trio of Women's Super League's teams.

Teams finishing first to fourth will automatically qualify for the quarter-finals, with the next eight teams - from fifth to 12th - facing off in two-legged play-offs to determine who will join them.

BBC Sport takes a look at how the three English clubs have fared so far on the continental stage - and what they need to progress.

Alessia Russo scored both goals as Arsenal came from behind to beat Real Madrid on Wednesday

Holders Arsenal have found it tough going in the Champions League this season, with results and performances failing to match the increased expectations set by that glorious triumph over Barcelona in the final last May.

An opening night defeat by Lyon and a total collapse against Bayern Munich bookended an unconvincing away win over Benfica, before Alessia Russo inspired a vital fightback to secure three points against Real Madrid.

Those results leave the European champions eighth in the table with six points from four games played so far, and on course to finish in one of the play-off spots.

Yet with their final two games of the league phase against teams in the elimination zone - Dutch side Twente and Belgian outfit Leuven - the Gunners will be confident of pushing for a top-four finish and automatic qualification to the knockouts.

Chelsea rue missed chances in draw with Barcelona

Chelsea's latest quest to secure a maiden Champions League crown has been a mixed bag of results so far. 

They made a stuttering start with a drab draw against Dutch champions Twente, but followed up by swatting Paris FC aside and hitting St Polten for six, before claiming an impressive 1-1 draw against old foes Barcelona.

So after four games played Sonia Bompastor's side are in sixth place, a point and two places outside the top four, but with momentum and confidence very much on the up.

They host Roma on matchday five before travelling to face two-time winners Wolfsburg in their final league phase game in what could well be a head to head shootout for automatic qualification.

Manchester United took the lead at Wolfsburg before going on to lose 5-2, their first defeat in this year's league phase

Manchester United enjoyed a flying start to their debut campaign in Europe, winning their first three games against Valerenga, Atletico Madrid and Paris St-Germain while conceding just one goal. But their progress came to a shuddering halt on matchday four with a 5-2 hammering by Wolfsburg.

That chastening defeat in Germany was United's third loss in four matches in all competitions, with a lack of squad depth looking to be taking its toll as they begin to struggle with the demands of fighting on multiple fronts.

With nine points from four games, they currently occupy fourth spot in the standings, which would secure automatic qualification to the quarter-finals. However considerable improvements are required to remain there.

Up next for Marc Skinner's side is the visit of Lyon to Leigh Sports Village, followed by a trip to face Italian giants Juventus.

All three English clubs could still qualify automatically for the quarter-finals

Each team in the competition has two games remaining in the league phase - one at home and one away - with their points tally after matchday six determining their final place in the league phase.

The sides from 13th to 18th will be eliminated from the competition.

As it stands, Manchester United would qualify automatically for the quarter-finals, while holders Arsenal and Chelsea would go into the play-offs.

Yet with just four points separating United in fourth place and Paris FC in 12th, things are far from decided. 

For an added bit of excitement, all nine games on matchday six (Wednesday 17 December) will be played at exactly the same time (20:00 GMT) so the standings could change right up until the very last whistle of the league phase.

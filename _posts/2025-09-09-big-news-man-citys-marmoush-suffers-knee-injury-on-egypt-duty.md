Let's dive into the details: Omar Marmoush made his international debut for Egypt in October 2021,

Manchester City are set to assess forward Omar Marmoush before Sunday's Manchester derby after he suffered a knee injury while on international duty with Egypt.

The 26-year-old was substituted in the ninth minute of his country's World Cup qualifier with Burkina Faso - which finished in a goalless draw - in Ouagadougou on Tuesday.

Marmoush, who joined City from Eintracht Frankfurt for Â£59m in January, was hurt following a robust fourth-minute challenge.

He initially played on after receiving treatment on the field before being replaced by Osama Faisal shortly afterwards.

A picture of the player leaving the pitch with medics was posted on the Egyptian Football Association's X account with the message: "Omar Marmoush suffers a bruised knee ligament.

"The player will undergo an X-ray upon his arrival to Cairo [on] Wednesday morning."

City's medical staff will also examine Marmoush, who has scored eight goals in 28 games for the club, when he returns to England.

The frontman has started City's last two top-flight matches - defeats to Tottenham and Brighton - after coming on as a substitute in the 4-0 opening-weekend win at Wolves.

Pep Guardiola's side host neighbours Manchester United at Etihad Stadium on Sunday (16:30 BST).

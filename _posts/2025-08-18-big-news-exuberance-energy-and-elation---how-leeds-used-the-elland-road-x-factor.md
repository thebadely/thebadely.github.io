Watch the highlights as Leeds leave it late to beat Everton 1-0

The banners brandished in The Don Revie Stand welcomed Leeds United back to the elite with the question: "Premier League, have you missed us?"

Leeds were back in all their glory on and off the pitch as Elland Road boiled in the sort of hothouse atmosphere that will be key to their ambitions of staying in the top flight.

They were gathered at The Old Peacock watering hole hours before kick-off, relishing their return before a night of sound, fury and controversy as Lukas Nmecha's hotly-disputed late penalty ensured Leeds followed another newly-promoted side Sunderland in making a winning start to the season.

Everton, wretched from first to last, and manager David Moyes left Elland Road nursing a sense of injustice, believing there was no way James Tarkowski could get his arm out of the way of Anton Stach's shot.

For Leeds, who did not care, it was what they felt they deserved at the end of night that will surely be their template for bucking the recent three up, three straight back down for those promoted from the Championship.

Elland Road stands alongside any arena when it comes to a hostile environment, the strains of "Marching On Together" rattling the rafters before kick-off, providing a shot of neat adrenalin for the Leeds team already fired up by manager Daniel Farke.

Leeds edge past Everton on Premier League return

'A scandal' - was Leeds penalty correct and what does law say?

Leeds, amid the cacophony, pinned passive, panicky Everton back in the first half, every tackle bringing supporters to their feet - especially a crunching challenge by Ethan Ampadu that left Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall prone on the turf.

If there was a worry for Leeds and Farke, it was that their dominance in the first half brought no reward, their attack a blunt instrument despite their superiority, with only one of their 12 shots on target.

Could they maintain that intensity after the break? The answer was no.

Instead, Leeds showed other qualities they will require this season as they dug deep, did the dirty work - albeit with little or no threat from a dreadful Everton - and eventually claimed the win with that dramatic late twist.

New Leeds keeper Lucas Perri was given a comfortable introduction as Everton left him virtually unemployed apart from one low shot from Carlos Alcaraz in the closing stages, which he saved comfortably.

Everton introduced new loan signing Jack Grealish with 20 minutes left, but this was a performance beyond rescue and redemption - an illustration of why Moyes has expressed his concerns about the lack of new arrivals, with acquisitions needed at right-back, on the right side and in the central midfield position.

Moyes clearly feels France under-21 striker Thierno Barry is a raw work in progress, but it is hard to see how he could have delivered anything worse than the performance Beto served up at Elland Road.

Leeds, in contrast, will be buoyed by the sheer exuberance and energy that poured down from the stands into Farke's players. One game only, yes, but the surge of belief and optimism this result and performance will deliver is vital.

Farke on 'special' opening day win against Everton

Statistics will also lift the mood as, for just a third time in Premier League history as many as two newly-promoted sides have won their opening games. It also happened in 1997-98 (Bolton Wanderers and Crystal Palace) and in 2021-22 (Brentford and Watford).

Before this Leeds victory, none of the previous 17 Championship champions had won their first game in the Premier League the following season, with five drawn and 12 lost. Leeds are the first side to achieve this feat since Sunderland beat Spurs (1-0) on the opening matchday in 2007-08.

Farke, understandably was elated, albeit cautious.

Leeds are off the mark and he has latest signing Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who has joined on a free transfer after leaving Everton, to provide a spearhead, with all Leeds fingers crossed that he stays fit.

So to answer the question posed on the pre-match banner, the Premier League has missed the sheer sporting theatre provided by Elland Road - but it may not be an experience welcomed by too many teams if this is anything to go by.

Leeds have a long road ahead this season, but this spectacular atmosphere was proof, if it were even needed, that Elland Road is where many of their battles need to be won this season.

Farke took the acclaim of ecstatic Leeds fans after the final whistle. The sound of The Kaiser Chiefs' "I Predict A Riot" belted out and the old place rocked to its foundations as it savoured Premier League victory again.

Recent history may be against Leeds United when it comes to staying up, and in Elland Road they have an 'X factor' that can make the crucial difference when it comes to defying those odds.

For Leeds United, their fans, and Farke, this was the perfect start.

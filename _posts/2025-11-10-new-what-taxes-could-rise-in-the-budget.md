Experts revealed that Chancellor Rachel Reeves is considering tax rises and spending cuts in the Budget, on 26 November.

In a pre-Budget speech, she said she will make the "necessary choices" for the economy, to bring down NHS waiting lists, the national debt and the cost of living.

Before the 2024 general election, Labour had promised not to increase income tax, National Insurance or VAT for working people.

The chancellor's Budget statement outlines government plans for raising or cutting taxes. It also includes big decisions about spending on public services such as health, schools and police. 

The statement is made to MPs in the House of Commons. It usually starts at about 12:30, after Prime Minister's Questions, and lasts for about an hour. 

The Leader of the Opposition, Conservative MP Kemi Badenoch, will give an immediate response. 

Reeves has confirmed that both tax rises and spending cuts are options. 

The chancellor needs more money in order to meet the self-imposed rules for government finances which she says are "non-negotiable". The two main rules are:

In her pre-Budget speech at the start of November, Reeves said her commitment to these rules was "iron-clad".

She blamed the previous Conservative government's austerity policies and the "rushed and ill-conceived" post-Brexit trading arrangements for damaging the UK economy. Reeves also highlighted the effects of high global inflation, and the uncertainty unleashed by US tariffs.

She said she would do what was necessary to fix the economy, not what was popular, and again refused to rule out tax rises. 

The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank previously said that Reeves would "almost certainly" have to raise taxes to make up what it estimates will be a £22bn shortfall in the government's finances. 

It argued this would let the government retain a £10bn buffer to meet the rules, but warned there was a "strong case" for increasing that safety margin. 

Separately, the BBC understands the government could be facing a further £20bn hole in the public finances because of fears over the UK's productivity - a measure of how efficiently businesses operate. 

Income Tax and National Insurance (NI)

The government could extend a freeze on income tax and NI thresholds, which is due to end in 2028.

Freezing the thresholds means that, as salaries rise over time, more people reach an income level at which they start paying tax and NI or qualify for higher tax rates.

Talking to the BBC in September, Reeves did not rule out extending the freeze. 

The Resolution Foundation think tank - which has close links to some members of the government - has recommended cutting 2p from the employee NI rate, while adding the same amount to income tax.

Reeves has signaled that she could focus on wealthy individuals, arguing "those with the broadest shoulders should pay their fair share".

She may change the rules for limited liability partnerships (LLPs), which are sometimes used by high earning professionals. The Times reported that making this group pay employers' National Insurance could raise £2bn.

Help with energy bills

In October, Reeves told the BBC that she would take "targeted action to deal with cost of living challenges" while inflation remains high. 

The BBC understands the government could bring down gas and electricity bills by cutting the current 5% rate of VAT charged on energy, or reducing some regulatory costs which suppliers can pass on to customers.

Welfare

The government is under pressure from its own MPs to scrap the two-child limit for benefit uplifts. Currently, households on universal credit get extra support for the first two, but no additional help for subsequent children.

The chancellor told the BBC she did not think it was right that children in bigger families were "penalised" in this way, suggesting she would like to axe the policy.

The FT has previously suggested she might water it down, but stop short of abolishing it altogether. 

Pensions 

According to the Times, the chancellor is planning to raise about £2bn by limiting a tax break on pension contributions.

The paper says Reeves is expected to limit the amount that workers can put into their pensions under "salary sacrifice" schemes without paying National Insurance to £2,000. At the moment there is no limit.

If a limit is introduced then any payments above that level would be subject to NI payments by both employees and employers.

Property taxes

Reports suggest the government may reform property taxes. It could replace stamp duty - a tax buyers pay on properties above a certain value in England and Northern Ireland - with a property tax.

Landlords could have to pay more taxes, and council tax could be replaced.

Some people selling their main residence may have to pay capital gains tax (CGT). 

Electric vehicles tax

As first reported in the Telegraph, the chancellor is considering a new tax on electric vehicles (EVs). It could help make up for the fall in fuel duty as more drivers move away from petrol and diesel cars. 

Isa reform

In July, the chancellor ruled out any immediate reform to cash Isas (Individual Savings Accounts). 

However, the FT has since reported that she may cut the cash Isa limit from £20,000 to £10,000. 

Business taxes

The TUC, the umbrella group for UK trade unions, has called for higher taxes on banks and online gaming companies.

In September, the chancellor told ITV News that "there is a case for gambling firms paying more". 

Youth employment guarantee

Also in September, Reeves said that young people who have been out of work for 18 months will be given paid placements to help them secure full-time employment. 

Small parcels

The FT has reported that the government may close a tax loophole which UK firms argue gives an unfair advantage to foreign online retailers like Shein. 

At the moment, overseas retailers can send packages worth less than £135 to the UK without incurring import duties.

The government has repeatedly said that boosting the economy is a key priority.

A growing economy usually means people spend more, extra jobs are created, more tax is paid and workers get better pay rises.

In October, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecast that the UK was set to be the second-fastest-growing major economy in 2025. However, it also predicted that the UK will face the highest rate of inflation among G7 nations in 2025 and 2026.

The latest official figures show the UK economy grew by 0.1% in August, after a 0.1% contraction in July. Between June and August, UK GDP grew by 0.3%, down from 0.6% in the previous three months.

Meanwhile, government borrowing - the difference between public spending and tax income - reached £20.2bn in September. That was the highest level seen for the month in five years, driven by an increase in debt interest payments. 

Prices are rising faster than expected. Inflation held steady at 3.8% in the year to September - above the Bank of England's 2% target.

At the Bank's policy meeting in October - its last before the Budget - it left interest rates unchanged at 4%, but said it judged inflation in the UK to have peaked.

It added that borrowing costs were "likely to continue on a gradual downward path".

MPs will debate the measures for four days, before voting on them. 

If approved, any tax changes in the Budget can come into effect immediately. However, the government must pass a finance bill to make them permanent. 

Further details about Budget measures - and what they cost - are published by the Treasury, the government's economic and finance ministry.

The Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) - which monitors the UK economy - will also release its assessment of the government's plans alongside its latest forecast.

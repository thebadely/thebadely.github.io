Let's dive into the details: Dublin player Aisling Maher (left) described being forced to change into a skort before last weekend's Leinster semi-final against Kilkenny as a "career low"

The Camogie Association has reacted to the controversy over players being forced to wear skorts as opposed to shorts by calling a Special Congress for 22 May to vote on the issue.

The Kilkenny and Dublin teams were forced to change into skorts before last weekend's Leinster Championship semi-final after taking to the field wearing shorts.

Both sides were told by the referee that the game would be abandoned if the players did not change.

A vote will take place at the Special Congress which if passed, will give players the option of wearing skorts or shorts from 24 May. 

"The Special Congress is being called to consider motion(s) to provide all players with the choice to wear skorts or shorts while playing camogie," said a Camogie Association statement.

"The association had proposed to deal with this issue at next year's Congress but having listened to player feedback, the association recognises that waiting until 2026 is not acceptable for many."

Previous attempts to change the skort rule did not pass at the Camogie Association's Annual Congress in 2024.

Camogie is governed by the Camogie Association of Ireland, which is closely linked to the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) and alongside the Ladies Gaelic Football Association is scheduled to formally integrate into the wider GAA in 2027.

Camogie Association president Brian Molloy said on Thursday: "Our goal is to deliver, as quickly as possible, a best-in-class playing uniform designed for female players and allowing for individual choice."

Following the stance taking by the Kilkenny and Dublin teams in last Saturday's game at Blanchardstown, Cork and Waterford players have said that they will wear shorts in Saturday's Munster Senior Final.

A number of Dublin club teams have worn shorts in fixtures this week after the county's camogie board told referees to allow games to proceed even if players didn't wear skorts.

Dublin captain Aisling Maher described last weekend's episode as a "career low" adding that she was "sick of being forced to wear a skort that is uncomfortable and unfit for purpose".

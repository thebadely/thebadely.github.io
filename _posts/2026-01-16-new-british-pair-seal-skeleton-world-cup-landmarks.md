Here’s what you need to know: Tabby Stoecker finished in the top six on five occasions across the World Cup's seven races

Tabby Stoecker has become the first British woman to win an overall skeleton World Cup medal for more than a decade.

The 25-year-old secured bronze with a sixth-place finish in the final event of the season in Altenberg, Germany.

Britain's most recent medal in the competition was Lizzy Yarnold's silver in 2015 - either side of her golds at the 2014 and 2018 Winter Olympics in Sochi and Pyeongchang.

Meanwhile, Matt Weston became the first British man to win three overall skeleton golds as he defended his World Cup title for a second successive season, while fellow Brit Marcus Wyatt took bronze for his World Cup campaign.

Britain also won gold in the mixed team event, which will make its Olympic debut next month.

Points from each World Cup event are awarded to the top-30 finishers and totalled across the season.

Stoecker - a former trapeze artist - recorded five top-six finishes including a European Championship silver last week in St Moritz in a race doubling up as a World Cup event.

She is the fourth British woman to win an overall World Cup medal, with Yarnold's fellow Olympic medallists Shelley Rudman and Alex Coomber having also landed podium finishes in the competition.

Belgium's Kim Meylemans won overall gold in the women's cup with six podiums across the seven-race season, while Germany's Jacqueline Pfeifer landed silver.

Matt Weston triumphed once again in the men's overall World Cup

Twenty-nine-year-old Weston's third consecutive overall victory saw him improve on Kristan Bromley's record, whose two wins he equalled last year.

China's Lin Qinwei was the overall men's runner-up, ahead of Wyatt, who recorded his second win of the campaign in Altenberg.

The sliders' attention will now turn to Italy's Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics, which begin on 6 February.

Experts revealed that Olav Kooij has an overall tally of six stage wins on the Tour of Britain

Dutch rider Olav Kooij sealed back-to-back victories at the Tour of Britain by winning a sprint finish on stage two.

The Team Visma-Lease a Bike rider went round the outside of Great Britain's Sam Watson on the final corner on the way to winning the 174.06km stage in wet weather around Stowmarket.

Watson finished third as Tom Crabbe, of Belgium, beat him to second spot. 

Kooij retained the leader's green jersey and extended his general classification lead to 14 seconds.

Crabbe, of Team Flanders-Baloise, moved into second place, while Ineos Grenadiers' Watson is 16 seconds behind the leader in third.

"It was a bit harder than yesterday - we had to use a lot of power to make the sprint in the first place," said Kooij.

"I didn't look back but it felt like it wasn't as close as yesterday so I'm happy with that.

"The race suits me quite well. Another stage win after some hard work from the team so I'm really happy with that."

Stage three takes place over 133.03km on Thursday between Milton Keynes and the Bedfordshire town of Ampthill.

It has been recently reported that Tommy Fleetwood's first PGA Tour victory came in his 164th competition

BMW PGA Championship

Venue: Wentworth, Surrey Dates: 11-14 September

BBC coverage: Live text and radio commentary of rounds three and four, followed by TV highlights from 19:00 BST on Saturday, 13 and Sunday, 14 September

There will be no resting on his laurels for Tommy Fleetwood as he returns to competitive action for the first time since his breakthrough victory in America at last month's Tour Championship.

Fleetwood says he is glad to be "back at work" as he prepares for this week's BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth.

The 34-year-old is also viewing the DP World Tour's flagship event in the context of Europe's upcoming Ryder Cup defence at Bethpage in New York.

Victory at the Tour Championship in Atlanta brought a $10m (Â£7.4m) winner's cheque and sparked a torrent of congratulatory messages.

They came from the likes of Tiger Woods, LeBron James and Caitlin Clark as well as friends and family and scores of golf fans from all parts.

"Winning's great, but it's only as great as the people that you share it with and appreciate it," Fleetwood told BBC Sport. "And I think the support that I got was amazing.

"And then the outpouring afterwards, the amount of people that you don't realise became invested in a story that was building, that was the overwhelming thing.

"It meant so much to me that so many people were happy for me and enjoyed that moment. That means more to me than any win."

Fleetwood enjoyed his success with his family after the tournament. His wife, Clare, and stepson Murray missed the East Lake triumph because Murray was recovering from back surgery.

"Our middle boy, Mo, had a spinal operation just over a month ago, so my family were unable to travel," Fleetwood said. "He had three and a half weeks in hospital."

The player added that Murray is making a good recovery and will be at Wentworth this week to support his stepdad's quest to land a first tour win on English soil.

The seven-times DP World Tour winner claimed his first PGA Tour triumph at the 164th attempt.

"I really enjoyed it for the first week and it was just nice to watch a few things back and just look at what happened," said Fleetwood.

"I learned from all the losses, you learn from the wins too. So I tried to go through the same mental process and look back and debrief everything that had happened, but also enjoy and relive those moments for a few days.

"And then I really did want to get back to work because there's so much more to come and such a big part of the golfing calendar to come."

Fleetwood's only professional wins on home soil came at the Formby Hall Classic in 2011 and the British Par-three Championship in 2013. 

A bigger priority is at Wentworth this week and sustaining his fine form of 2025, which has seen him record eight top-10s including a joint third, fourth and the Tour Championship win in the PGA Tour's three play-off events in August.

"I always try and stay as present as possible," he said.

"And that's been important to me, especially over the last few weeks and months, but this week's a big week for me."

Nevertheless he cannot help turning his mind towards the end of the month and Europe's bid for a first away win in 13 years. "We are firmly in the middle of Ryder Cup season," Fleetwood said.

"The team's been set. We're now getting together, you see your team-mates and you're spending time with them.

"We have the practice trip to come [the team depart for New York on Sunday night], then you have the week of the Ryder Cup.

"This is going to be my fourth Ryder Cup, which is special to think of and really cool.

"But whether it's your first, or your fourth, or your eighth, this is what we dreamt about as kids and you know you have to embrace it and enjoy it.

"And look forward to every single thing that comes with the Ryder Cup. I love being a part of this process."

Fleetwood's popularity among US fans was evident as he edged out American Patrick Cantlay in Atlanta, but he knows it is likely to be more hostile for the European players at Bethpage.

"Well I hope they don't dislike me too much for a week," Fleetwood smiled. "I hope our love for each other remains. 

"One of the great things about the Ryder Cup is what impact the home fans can have. That's the way it should be. And I'm really excited about what the atmosphere will be.

"It's an experience that I've definitely never had before, an away New York crowd, and that's probably the same for all of us. I'm just really looking forward to embracing it and taking it all in and enjoying it."

Before that there is this week's attempt to make up ground on the DP World Tour's Race to Dubai where the largely US-based Fleetwood languishes in 94th place.

It would be radically improved with a victory here at Wentworth.

"There have been times when I've got myself up there in this event, but I have never really had a shot at it coming down the stretch on a Sunday," he said.

"I would really love to be in that position, just to get that home crowd feeling.

"I'm always excited about this event and I hope that I can continue the strong form I've had throughout the year and throughout the summer."

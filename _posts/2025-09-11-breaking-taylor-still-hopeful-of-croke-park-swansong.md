Experts revealed that Katie Taylor retained her undisputed light-welterweight title with victory against Amanda Serrano in the final fight of their trilogy in July 

Katie Taylor has said fighting at Croke Park "would be the icing on the cake" of her career.

The undisputed light-welterweight champion closed the door on her rivalry with Amanda Serrano at New York's Madison Square Garden in July with a vintage performance in victory to complete a clean sweep of their trilogy.

Taylor has not been drawn on her future since, but instead has "been relaxing at home with family".

Although there is no definitive answer as to what, if anything, is next, the Irishwoman has left the door ajar for a return with the GAA stadium in Dublin high on her wish list.

"It was a great way to cap off the trilogy," the 39-year-old told to Matchroom Boxing's Flash Knockdown Podcast, external. 

"I knew I had the potential and ability to make it easier for myself. I'm so glad I showed that with my boxing skills. It wasn't a war this time. I came out unscathed.

"My name will be embedded with Amanda's forever. They have been three history-making fights, I have the utmost respect for her."

"The one fight I really, really want is at Croke Park. That would top off my career so well. There's been so much talk over the past few years but I'm still clinging onto the hope that one day I can fight there. It would be the icing on the cake for me."

Hearn feels Taylor's performance against Serrano in July may make it more likely she will return

Eddie Hearn, Taylor's promoter, confirmed he will sit down with the Bray fighter on Friday: "Not for a 'what's happening?' but more a 'how you feeling?'"

Taylor's second and third fights with Serrano were promoted by Jake Paul's Most Valuable Promotions, who have indicated they would be willing to fund a Croke Park date with their fighter Chantelle Cameron, which would also be the final chapter of a trilogy with the current score at one win apiece.

Hearn would be happy to let Paul take the lead once again but insists it would need to be a "big fight" to make Croke Park feasible.

"After the [Serrano] fight, I thought 'what a great time to retire' but now I don't know. I'd say she is 50/50 in her head," Hearn said.

"He [Paul] can fund it if he wants. We've taken his money two times and it's been beautiful. Katie has made an absolute fortune and I would like to take this opportunity to thank Jake Paul for lining her pockets. 

"Chantelle will try to goad Katie but she isn't afraid of anyone. It's a tough fight but if Katie had another war against Serrano, everyone would have asked her if that's it, but because she boxed like Katie Taylor from the amateurs with feet and speed, you probably think you can have another one.

"I believe Holly Holm is fighting for the world title [WBA lightweight] against Stephanie Han later in the year and she has the profile. Katie can fight anyone, but if you want to go to Croke Park, it has to be a big fight."

According to new developments, Jonas Vingegaard

Jonas Vingegaard won stage nine of the Vuelta a Espana with a solo attack to narrow the gap to overall leader Torstein Traeen to just 37 seconds.

The two-time Tour de France winner shaved two minutes off Traeen's lead in the ride from Alfaro to the Valdezcaray ski resort, landing his third stage victory in the event.

Britain's Tom Pidcock attempted to stay with the 28-year-old Dane along with Joao Almeida, but finished 24 seconds off the pace in second spot.

"I felt great today, and I felt amazing on the final climb," said Visma-Lease a Bike rider Vingegaard.

"I asked [my team-mates] to accelerate, and they did a great job. It was fantastic teamwork and I'm very happy that I was able to finish it off."

Norwegian Traeen launched a late attack in the final three kilometres to finish one minute 46 seconds behind Vingegaard, retaining the red jersey.

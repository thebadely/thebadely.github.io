The Hundred men's competition, Lord's

London Spirit 186-4 (100 balls): Williamson 53 (28), Smith 44 (18); Bracewell 2-26

Scorecard. Table

London Spirit kept their faint qualification hopes alive with a 47-run win over Southern Brave in The Hundred men's competition at Lord's.

Brave, whose own chances of finishing in the top three were significantly dented by the defeat, finished 139-9 - with the injured Reece Topley unable to bat - in pursuit of a challenging 187 to win.

The visitors were immediately pegged back in their chase by the loss of captain James Vince for four after just six balls, and Spirit chipped away with regular wickets to keep the run rate under control throughout. 

Spinner Liam Dawson was the pick of the bowlers for Spirit with 3-23, while seamer Richard Gleeson backed him up with 3-30. Brave lacked a match-winning contribution, with Jason Roy and Laurie Evans' efforts of 37 the highest scores. 

Both Spirit and Brave now need to win their final matches, against Oval Invincibles and Welsh Fire respectively, and hope for other results to go their way - but even then it would still come down to net run-rate. 

Knowing a defeat would knock them out, Spirit's batters came out with admirable intent and David Warner and Jamie Smith raced to 43-0 from the powerplay.

Brave fought back to remove both openers in the space of four balls through spinner Michael Bracewell, with Smith making 44 from just 18 deliveries, but Spirit skipper Kane Williamson ensured his side did not lose the momentum.

Williamson smacked a 26-ball fifty and combined his usual touch and class with three powerful sixes, including two off England's Jofra Archer, who struggled with figures of 1-42.

Jamie Overton whacked three fours in a seven-ball 16 at the death to complete a fine all-round effort and condemned Brave to a disappointing defeat, in contrast to the fortunes of their women's side, who earlier secured their place in the final with a seventh straight win.

Superchargers win fuels knockout hopes

The Hundred men's competition, Headingley

Northern Superchargers 198-4 (100 balls): Brook 56 (27), Crawley 49 (25)

Oval Invincibles 182-7 (100 balls): Ferreira 41 (15); Lawes 2-22, Duffy 2-39 

Superchargers won by 16 runs 

Scorecard Table

Northern Superchargers and Oval Invincibles are guaranteed a top-three finish after the Superchargers won the encounter between the two teams in the earlier match at Headingley.

Both teams have 20 points and only Trent Rockets, currently on 16 with two games to play, can match or overtake them. 

After Harry Brook's first half-century of this year's Hundred and Zak Crawley's rapid 49 helped Superchargers set a target of 199, Will Jacks' 11-ball 25 gave the Invincibles a brisk start in their chase.

But Jacob Duffy halted his charge inside the powerplay before Tom Lawes struck twice, dismissing Tawanda Muyeye and the in-form Jordan Cox - who came into the match on the back of three consecutive half-centuries.

When Sam Curran edged Matthew Potts to wicketkeeper Michael Pepper, the Invincibles were reeling at 115-4. 

But Donovan Ferreira gave them some hope by hitting three fours and three sixes from seven deliveries before falling for a 15-ball 41 - Duffy ending the chance of a dramatic comeback to set the Superchargers on their way to a crucial win. 

Earlier, openers Crawley and Dawid Malan gave the hosts a flying start after being sent in to bat by Invincibles skipper Sam Billings.

Crawley set the tone, helping them race to 49 without loss by the end of the powerplay, before falling just one run short of a fifty.

Captain Brook consolidated the Superchargers' innings with a 27-ball 56 that included five sixes and three fours, before David Miller added the finishing touches, launching Tom Curran for three consecutive sixes in the final set to take them to 198-4.

Two-time defending champions Invincibles will host London Spirit in their final game on Monday, while Superchargers take on Manchester Originals the following day, live on the BBC.

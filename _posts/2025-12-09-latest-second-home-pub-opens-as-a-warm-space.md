Let's dive into the details: A pub has said it opened as a "warm space" for locals after hearing "upsetting" stories from customers who found it cheaper to be there than to heat their homes.

The Pheasant, in Newport, Shropshire, posted on social media offering "warmth without worry" and saying people deserved to be warm and dry in a "community hub".

Warm spaces are often run by community groups where people can find company and hot drinks during cold weather to combat heating bills and loneliness.

Pub regular, Michael Tucker, 79, said: "It is my second home, the house is empty, my wife is in a home. So I come down and get some nice company."

He added: "I do not have to have the house red hot, I just come here and it's lovely and warm, you know, all the time."

The pub's social media post said: "We want to be somewhere you can walk into, always see a familiar face and where it's warm enough you don't need to leave your coat on. Bring yourself a sandwich if you want to."

Emma Holmes runs The Pheasant with her husband Ben.

She said: "The cost of living is going up more, it is something we are hearing more when people say how warm it is in the pub. 

"And genuinely, we have heard people say how much cheaper it is to come in and have a few drinks and stay warm and speak to their friends, than stay at home and put the heating on.

However, she was clear there would be no requirement to buy a drink: "We want to be a community hub and help anyone out."

Rob Williams visits the pub most afternoons and has his spot by the window and, more importantly, near the radiator.

About the licensees' social media post, he said: "It means I do not have to turn on the gas for half a day, I don't have to turn the electric for half a day and I am nice and warm and snug. 

"I am interacting with people, it is good for your mental state, it is very good."

That is something that Emma recognises: "If someone lives on their own, it is a lot to go 24 or 48 hours without speaking to anybody else. 

"Some of them just come in and read the newspaper with a pint, but they are welcome to do what they want in here really!"

Rob Dudley is also a regular and said, "It is brilliant, it is like Cheers and the beer is pretty cheap, the sport is always on and everyone feels comfortable.

"Newport is a lovely town, I have lived here all my life. We come here have a laugh and bar staff are always brilliant. 

"I mean the bar staff here carry the beer over to the older chaps. You do not get that in many pubs but this pub is great, that is why we are here."

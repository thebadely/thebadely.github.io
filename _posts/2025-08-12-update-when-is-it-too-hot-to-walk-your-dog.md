Let's dive into the details: As temperatures rise across much of the UK, it's not just humans who feel the heat.  

What can you do to make sure your pets are cool and comfortable?

The RSPCA says that exercise is the most frequent trigger of heatstroke for dogs and advises adjusting your routine during hot weather. 

It says there is no "safe" temperature for walks, as it depends on your dog's breed, age, health and temperament. 

The charity also recommends the pavement test: if you can't comfortably hold your hand on the ground for five seconds, it's too hot for your dog's paws. 

If you do walk your dog, go out in the early morning or late evening, look for shaded areas and walk on grass where possible. 

The charity says these signs could mean your dog is suffering in the heat:

You should also avoid running or cycling with your dog when it is hot.

If your dog is getting less exercise than usual, the RSPCA suggests keeping them engaged at home with puzzle toys or training games. 

Some dogs are more at risk of heatstroke than others.  

This includes those with underlying health conditions or thick coats which can trap heat. Puppies or older dogs may also struggle to regulate their temperature. 

Dogs pant to keep themselves cool, but the shorter snouts of certain flat-faced breeds like bulldogs and pugs make this difficult. This means they are at particular risk from overheating. 

According to the PDSA, symptoms of heatstroke include: 

If you see these signs, first try to cool your dog down as quickly as possible.

Move them to a shaded area and slowly pour cold water over their body. Do not cover them in damp or wet towels as this can trap heat.

The faster you can bring their temperature down, the lower the risk of serious injury. 

Once your pet has started to cool down, contact your vet for guidance and possible further treatment. 

The RSPCA says it is essential that animals have access to shaded spaces inside and outside. 

Provide plenty of clean water - you can add ice cubes to their water bowl. Pets may also enjoy frozen edible snacks.

Put wet or damp towels underneath their body - but don't place them directly on top.

Several pet cooling mats and jackets are available, but make sure you follow the  instructions. Products that need to be kept constantly wet can actually make your pet hotter if they dry out. 

Some animals may enjoy playing with frozen toys, or cooling off in a paddling pool â€“ although you should always supervise pets around water.

Keeping dogs and other furry animals like cats well-groomed prevents the build-up of matted fur, which can make it harder for them to stay cool. 

Make sure any indoor animal cages or fish tanks are not in direct sunlight.

Never leave a pet in a locked car, caravan or other vehicle for any length of time, as temperatures can rise quickly to dangerous levels - which can be fatal. 

Similarly, don't leave animals shut inside conservatories, sheds or greenhouses.

You may also want to leave out extra water in your garden for birds, foxes and other wildlife creatures. 

Dogs and cats can get sunburnt - especially if they are light-coloured or have thin patches of fur. Ears, noses, eyelids and bellies are also vulnerable. 

Sunburn can be painful for pets, and in extreme cases can lead to skin cancer. 

Some active ingredients in human sun cream are toxic to pets so vets recommend using a pet-safe waterproof sunscreen, with an SPF rating of 30 or higher. Some companies sell sunscreen with a bitter taste to stop animals licking it off. 

The PDSA suggests you apply sunscreen to a small area of skin first, and leave it for 24 hours to ensure the animal does not react. 

Once you know the sunscreen is safe, you can gently apply a thin layer of sunscreen on the exposed white and light patches of skin, plus their nose and ears. 

The PDSA warns pet owners to look out for the following symptoms of sunburn: 

The Dogs Trust advises owners to first check whether the beach they want to visit allows dogs.

If it does, the charity recommends taking plenty of fresh water and making sure your dog doesn't drink sea water. 

Check the temperature of the sand and, if there's no natural shade, try to create some with a beach umbrella, sun tent or windbreak. 

If your dog likes to go in the sea, check the tide times and make sure you understand any swimming hazards.

Keep your dog on a lead when you are near fast-flowing water or cliff edges. 

When you leave the beach rinse any sand and seawater off their coat and paws with tap water to stop it causing any irritation.

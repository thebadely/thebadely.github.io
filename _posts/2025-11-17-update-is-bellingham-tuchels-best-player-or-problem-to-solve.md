Here’s what you need to know: Jude Bellingham, 22, is aiming to play in his fourth major tournament for England at next summer's World Cup

Jude Bellingham has been one of England's key players since he made his debut as a 17-year-old, racking up 46 caps and scoring at both the 2022 World Cup and Euro 2024.

But things have soured for the Real Madrid midfielder under England head coach Thomas Tuchel, who has left Bellingham out of squads and starting line-ups in recent months - and in the summer referred to his on-field behaviour as "repulsive" before later apologising.

A stellar World Cup qualifying campaign culminated in a 2-0 victory over Albania on Sunday, but Bellingham was visibly irritated at being substituted in the 84th minute. 

Tuchel said the incident would be "reviewed" while emphasising "behaviour is key".

Bellingham's reaction has raised questions: is he simply frustrated in a lesser role under a new coach, or is possible tension between star player and coach a significant concern before next summer's tournament?

Bellingham's talent is not up for debate - at 22 he has won six major trophies in two countries, been voted in the team of the season for the Bundesliga and then La Liga for the past four seasons, and won the England men's player of the year award for the 2024-25 season.

But competition in the attacking midfield position has increased since he broke into the team: Cole Palmer, Morgan Rogers, Eberechi Eze and Phil Foden are all rivals - and Bellingham is clearly no longer guaranteed a starting berth.

Bellingham's breakthrough year came in 2022, when he was named in England's starting XI for all five World Cup games in Qatar.

In 2023 he was used sparingly but then started every match at Euro 2024, including the final. Since Tuchel arrived in January, he has featured for just 374 minutes.

His England career has followed a pattern - he plays sporadically before a major tournament, then becomes a key player when they get there.

"I think we have the right manager to choose who plays number 10 based on what he sees rather than the player's name," ex-England defender Stephen Warnock told BBC Radio 5 Live. 

"I think it's Morgan Rogers' shirt at this moment. You have got to do what is for the good of the team. Bellingham is going to have take it on the chin."

Conor Coady, who was Bellingham's England team-mate at Euro 2020 and the 2022 World Cup, added: "He is under a bit of pressure now when he is playing, and probably feels like he is playing catch-up. 

"He missed the last camp, he knows Rogers is doing really well and wants to play every minute he can to show the manager he can play well for England.

"It's refreshing to hear a manager sound so in control of the situation."

The key questions facing Tuchel before World Cup

Bellingham played well against Albania and played a key role in the second goal against Serbia after coming off the bench in the previous fixture.

"I expect him to be the starting number 10 at the World Cup," said David Walker, co-host of The England Pod.

"There seems to be a suspicion that Bellingham has the potential to be a disruptive character, but I don't really know where that label has come from.

"A lot of this seems to be Tuchel speaking about him clumsily when he said 'repulsive' - that was regrettable.

"He does have occasions on the pitch where he maybe lets his frustration get the better of him, but he generally carries himself very impressively and he has the ability to dig England out of a hole in big moments."

Bellingham has scored 41 goals in 111 appearances for Real Madrid since joining two years ago, playing a key role in a side which has won La Liga and the Uefa Champions League.

He flourished under the leadership of Carlo Ancelotti, renowned for his ability to handle the personalities in Los Blancos' squad, but like his team-mates has found things more difficult under new manager Xabi Alonso this season.

"He has a great reputation in Madrid," said Jesus Bengoechea, a writer for Real Madrid fan media outlet La Galerna. 

"The fans love him, not only for his technical quality but his commitment to the team. He comes across as somebody who is really dedicated to the shirt and what it represents.

"He plays a very influential role in the dressing room - he is one of the players who has stepped up after players like Luka Modric, Toni Kroos and Karim Benzema left. It surprises a lot of people that he is not more acclaimed in England.

"Lately there have been some rumours about him being not so disciplined in some ways, certain things about the level of intense work Alonso is asking the players to do. But we haven't seen that on the pitch and I find it hard to believe.

"Alonso is like Tuchel, both quite cold characters and very tactical. I think it is a matter of personalities that don't gel."

Bellingham has scored three goals in 11 appearances for Alonso's Real Madrid this season, missing six matches with a shoulder injury

Tense relationships with senior players are not new to Tuchel, nor are disputes over substitutions.

He argued with Kylian Mbappe on the touchline during his time as Paris St-Germain manager after taking the French forward off, and criticised Callum Hudson-Odoi's "attitude and energy" when substituting the winger just 31 minutes after bringing him on in a Premier League match.

Sadio Mane reportedly punched team-mate Leroy Sane at half-time after being frustrated at being dropped for a Champions League fixture when Tuchel managed Bayern Munich.

"Tuchel speaks his mind - he is open and honest," said Walker. "He was quite strong in his reaction to this. He is very demanding.

"Bellingham will always be a big story, because he's one of England's best players and plays for Real Madrid. 

"But if this is the worst thing that's happening to England at the moment, given how difficult things have been in the past, then that's probably a pretty good sign."

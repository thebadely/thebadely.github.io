According to new developments, Thierno Barry scored 11 goals for Villarreal last season

Everton have moved closer to reaching an agreement with Villarreal over signing France Under-21s striker Thierno Barry.

The 22-year-old has a Â£34.5m release clause with the Spanish club and is understood to be keen on a move to Merseyside.

Barry scored 11 goals and provided four assists in 38 games last season as Villarreal finished fifth in La Liga to qualify for the Champions League.

He would join as a replacement for striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin who left Everton upon the expiry of his contract this week.

Forward Armando Broja also exited when his loan ended, returning to Chelsea without the deal being made permanent.

Barry was born in Lyon and left French club Sochaux aged 19 to play in the Belgian second division with Beveren.

The following season he moved to Swiss Super League club Basel, before joining Villarreal in August 2024 in a deal worth about Â£13m.

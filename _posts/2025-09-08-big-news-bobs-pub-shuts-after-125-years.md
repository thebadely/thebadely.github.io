Hereâ€™s what you need to know: A landmark pub in Scunthorpe is closing after trading for 125 years.

The Lord Roberts, on Well Street, is affectionately known to locals as Bob's.

On Sunday, a closing party was held, with landlord Graham Matthews admitting he was "tearful" about the closure.

He said: "People haven't got the same [amount] of money anymore, so they don't come out as much. Young ones today don't come out at all." 

In 2003, the pub was converted into a disco-bar named Cre8, before turning back into a pub. 

Mr Matthews, 68, ran the pub for a few years in the Nineties. In 2015, he returned - joined by his partner.

Prior to the leaving party, he said: "I think we'll have a few cries and there will be a few shots and a few whiskies.

"I would think every public house in the country is struggling. Hospitality is not like what it used to be, we're all struggling now."  

An auction was being held to sell the pub's contents, including memorabilia, said Mr Matthews.

The pub is currently listed for sale, and the BBC understands one prospective buyer plans to turn the building into a wedding function and private hire venue.

Bellamy 'proud' of Wales' effort in Brussels

Craig Bellamy had been waiting for this moment. What he might have struggled to envisage was the sheer chaos of his first defeat as Wales head coach.

Unbeaten in his first nine games, Bellamy would have equalled a national record had his team avoided defeat in Belgium â and they almost did it in the most dramatic fashion imaginable.

Brussels is a city Bellamy knows well, having lived there during his time as a coach with Anderlecht.

But the first half was an alien experience for him on the touchline, watching on as his Wales team were cut to shreds by a Belgian side who had rediscovered their verve.

Rediscover your verve? In a city famous for its potently strong ales, Wales might have said: "Hold my beer."

This is a team Bellamy has built in his image. They are daring, adventurous, unafraid to lose in the pursuit of glory.

To sit back and play for a draw is not in their make-up, Bellamy said beforehand, and Wales backed that up with a momentous performance to roar back from 3-0 down to level.

Harry Wilson's penalty, Sorba Thomas' composed low strike and Brennan Johnson's header had Belgium rattled and Wales dreaming.

Kevin de Bruyne had the final say to secure a 4-3 win for Belgium, but Bellamy could not help but smile when he was asked for his thoughts.

"I don't like losing. I understand the game, but how you lose is more important," he said.

"Who are you as a person? Who is your team? I see that and I'm beyond proud. We're a good team.

"I understand results, I really do, but football means more to me than that. It always has done. I'd rather try something great and fail than do nothing and succeed."

Neither Bellamy nor his players are shackled by the fear of losing. That is why they have enjoyed such a positive start to his tenure.

To briefly leave the spiritual aspect of the game and to deal with cold, hard practical facts, this first defeat under Bellamy knocked Wales off the top of their World Cup qualifying group.

North Macedonia are the new leaders with eight points from four games, Wales are second with seven from four, while Belgium lurk menacingly with four points from two.

Wales and Belgium will meet again in Cardiff in October, renewing a rivalry which has provided Welsh football with some of its greatest moments over the past decade.

Wales are unbeaten in their past four home meetings with Belgium, and Bellamy believes there is more drama to unfold in Group J.

"To come to a top-eight team [in the world rankings] and can we play the way we want to play? I think the Belgium players saw it as well," Bellamy said.

"Think I read something from the Belgium media â 'an easy way to the USA'? There's a lot of life in this group and today I saw a lot of life in this team.

"We aren't going anywhere. I will have a couple of weeks now of recharging, but I'm beyond proud and really excited about the future."

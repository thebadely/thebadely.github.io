Let's dive into the details: Two riders suffered "unsurvivable injuries" during a British Superbike Championship event, their inquests have heard. 

Owen Jenner, 21, and Shane Richardson, 29, died in a crash at the first corner of the Oulton Park circuit in Tarporley, Cheshire, on 5 May.

Richardson over-accelerated about 300m from the start line in the British Supersport Championship race and was thrown into the path of fellow riders, who Jenner was unable to avoid. 

A coroner recorded a conclusion of accidental death and said the evidence suggested the race organisers had followed "all required procedure". 

Jenner died at the scene from head injuries while Richardson died from chest injuries about two hours after the crash, while en route to Royal Stoke University Hospital.

The inquests, at Cheshire Coroner's Court in Warrington, heard post-mortem examinations revealed their injuries were "unsurvivable".

The Supersport Championship, in which the crash happened, is a support class to the main British Superbike series.

Race director Stuart Higgs, of organisers Motor Sport Vision Racing, said the first corner, known as Old Hall corner, was not considered to be an area of high risk and had no previous fatalities.

Some 37 competitors lined up for the first race of the 2025 season on the Bank Holiday weekend, the inquest heard.

Asked by senior coroner for Cheshire, Jacqueline Devonish, whether the sport involved an inherent risk of death, Higgs replied: "Sadly it does.

"The riders sign a very cold declaration that they understand they may risk injury or death."

PC Andrew Balmforth, a forensic collision investigator for Cheshire Police, said he was satisfied there were no issues with the race track and that licence and inspection requirements had been obtained beforehand.

He said both men were hit by their fellow competitors but there was nothing the other riders could have done.

Jenner, of Crowborough, East Sussex, had been riding motorcycles from the age of six and was considered a "rising star" after he won three British championship titles across different classes.

His parents, Michael and Emma Jenner, had travelled to Cheshire for the weekend and Michael Jenner said his son had been "excited" to start the race.

Hannah Wright, long-term partner of New Zealander Richardson, said he had ridden motorcycles competitively from the age of four and had a "very successful" international career, during which he had gained "exceptional racing experience".

She said: "Prior to the race we had a laugh and a banter in the garage with his team. Everybody was in great spirits that day. 

"We even spoke about how we had such a good feeling for the season that year."

Devonish said: "On the strength of the evidence we have heard I am satisfied those governing the race at Oulton Park that race weekend followed all required procedure, insofar as they had undertaken the annual inspections appropriately and they had required licences from their riders."

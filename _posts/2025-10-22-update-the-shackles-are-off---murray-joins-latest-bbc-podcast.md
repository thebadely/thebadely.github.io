The Ireland Rugby Social will be available every Tuesday on BBC Sounds

Former Ireland star Conor Murray says the "shackles are off" as he launches a new BBC Sounds podcast - the Ireland Rugby Social.

Murray, who won international 125 caps, will join BBC Sport NI's Gavin Andrews to give his unique insight into the mindset of a professional athlete as Ireland gear up for the autumn internationals and the 2026 Six Nations. 

Each week, Murray will sit down with players, coaches and rugby insiders to dive into the sport's biggest stories as Ireland face New Zealand, Japan, Australia and South Africa this autumn, before the Six Nations kicks off next year.

With five Six Nations titles and two United Rugby Championships with Munster, the three-time British and Irish Lion is uniquely placed to go beyond the headlines - and he says: "I can say what I want."

"As a player you are always worried about protecting the team or the coach, or saying something the coach might not agree with after," said Murray.

"But now the shackles are off. Now you can speak your mind and say things how you see it."

Every Tuesday there will be podcast with a special guest who will offer their own insight into their life in rugby, whether that is playing, coaching or a role you may not know about.

Additionally, throughout November and Six Nations there will be a second podcast reflecting on the game that's just been played and a look ahead at what is to come. 

"Rugby has been such a big part of my life for so long, so I think staying connected to it is probably a good idea," Murray added.

"I can give some insight, get some guests with some interesting stories - stories that you maybe haven't heard before. 

"I know the guests we have will be able to relax and tell us their true thoughts and stories."

According to new developments, Adam Peaty is a three-time Olympic and eight-time world champion

Great Britain's Adam Peaty is targeting four gold medals in the pool at the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028. 

The 30-year-old has previously competed in the 100m breaststroke, 4x100m mixed medley, and 4x100m medley at the Olympics, winning three gold medals and three silver medals. 

It was confirmed in April 2025 that the 50m breaststroke would be one of three disciplines added to the 2028 programme, with Peaty a three-time world champion and the current world record holder over that distance. 

Peaty has said he is aiming to compete in both individual disciplines in Los Angeles, while the two medley events have the added incentive of beating defending champions USA on "home turf". 

"I'm very excited the 50m has been added but I will do the 100m as well, so that will give me four opportunities to [win a] medal," he told BBC Radio 5 Live. 

"We want to beat America on home turf in that medley. We've got the incredible Oliver Morgan on backstroke, some very strong times - and that's always been our weak link at previous Olympics. It's very exciting."

Adam Peaty's mum tells of sacrifices behind medals

Peaty took a break from swimming after winning silver in the 100m breaststroke at the 2024 Olympics in Paris. 

He previously took an extended break from sport in 2023 to prioritise his mental health after experiencing a "major, major burnout". 

However, while "the athlete in my head" is missing not competing at the ongoing World Championships in Singapore, Peaty has a clear plan for his return to competition and is training "a lot smarter" as an older athlete.

"I made the call in January or February, when I started to get back into training, that this Worlds wouldn't be for me because it would be too rushed," Peaty said. 

"I want to be at the [2026] Commonwealth Games. I want to be at the Europeans next year. I'm never going to take my spot for granted - just because I've got a world record doesn't mean I'm going to be there, it's ridiculous. I've got to earn those places, which excites me. 

"I did some race prep before I came out here to see where I'm at and we're in a good place for October World Cups in America and Canada."

On his training, he added: "If you'd told me 10 years ago I'd be doing a pilates session this morning, I would have said 'no way'. 

"I look back on certain camps and I was chasing numbers, I needed the outputs, the validation. But I wasn't swimming the smartest in my head in terms of recovery, mental health and the warning signs of what burnout looks like. 

"[Now] it's what I decide. This block [in Los Angeles], I know it's a holiday so I'm just going to see how I feel. When I get back into England I'm ramping up for the Commonwealth Games - 4km sessions, 4.5km - and that gives me the best results."

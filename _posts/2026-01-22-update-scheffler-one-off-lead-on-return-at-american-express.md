World number one Scottie Scheffler shot a nine-under 63 in the first round of the American Express in California on his first PGA Tour appearance of the season.

The 29-year-old has not played this year and is yet to win the American Express tournament, which boasts a prize of Â£1,236,000 ($1.656m) for the winner.

Scheffler sits one off the lead in La Quinta held jointly by Min Woo Lee of Australia and the United States' Pierceson Coody.

He is joined on nine under by a host of players including Scotland's Robert MacIntyre and former US PGA champion Jason Day.

Unusually, the field play across three different courses before the cut on Saturday.

Scheffler birdied five of his first six holes while Coody hit successive birdies on his way to shooting 29 on the back nine.

Let's dive into the details: Chris Wakelin is ranked 17th in the world 

England's Chris Wakelin won eight frames in a row on his way to securing the Scottish Open title with a 9-2 victory over Chang Bingyu in Edinburgh on Sunday. 

The 33-year-old trailed his Chinese opponent 2-1, but dominated the afternoon session of the final to seal the second ranking victory of his career and Â£100,000 in prize money. 

Wakelin made seven 50-plus breaks during the match as the 23-year-old Bingyu struggled to recover as the Englishman - who had pneumonia last week and said his one-year-old daughter Mia was teething - levelled at 2-2. 

"When we arrived here I had no expectations at all, and the last few weeks we've had some issues at home," Wakelin told TNT Sports. 

"My only objective this week was to walk in the building and get my cue out, so to be the winner is just magic."

Wakelin's first ranking even title came in January 2023 at the Snooker Shoot Out and he paid tribute to Bingyu, who is ranked 70th and made nine century breaks during the tournament.

He said Bingyu was "an absolute credit to the sport" and added: "He's a phenomenal talent and definitely one to watch out for and I'm sure he'll be back in a big final soon."

Bingyu defeated 2023 world champion Kyren Wilson in the third round, four-time world champion Mark Selby in the quarter-finals and world number 10 Mark Allen in the semi-finals.

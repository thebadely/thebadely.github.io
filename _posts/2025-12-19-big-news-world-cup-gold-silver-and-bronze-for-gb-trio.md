According to new developments, Weston (centre) and Wyatt (left) became the first British men to win gold and silver at the same World Championships in March

Great Britain's Matt Weston continued his perfect start to the Skeleton World Cup campaign with gold in Sigulda, Latvia, as compatriot Marcus Wyatt finished second.

Later on Friday, Amelia Coltman made it a hat-trick of medals for the British team when she claimed bronze in the women's race.

Weston, 28, has won the first three men's races of the 2025-26 season, while Wyatt's silver medal was a first individual medal this term.

Two-time world champion Weston finished with a combined time of one minute 40.35 seconds, with Wyatt 0.85 seconds behind. Felix Keisinger of Germany completed the podium, finishing just 0.03 seconds after the silver medallist.

Victory for Weston takes him 107 points clear of China's Zheng Yin at the top of the World Cup rankings. Wyatt sits in sixth place, 62 points behind Yin.

Coltman's third-placed finish, behind Belgium's Kim Meylemans and Anna Fernstadt of the Czech Republic, was her best result of the season and only the second World Cup medal of her career after gold in PyeongChang last year.

Weston and Wyatt race again in Sigulda on Saturday before taking a Christmas break, from which they will return to action in Winterberg, Germany on 2 January.

According to new developments, A man experiencing homelessness said he hoped the government would focus on increasing accessibility to housing in its upcoming Budget. 

Josh, 26, who is currently a resident at the night shelter Jimmy's in Cambridge, said the availability of council housing and "move-on housing" - shared accommodation where people can receive support - was important.  

Chancellor Rachel Reeves will deliver Labour's second budget on 26 November. 

Cambridge City Council received 1,139 homelessness applications between April 2024 and March 2025, which was a 13% rise on the previous year. 

Josh said his focus was to get back into work after he completed his electrician qualifications, which he said were "just as hard as a degree in my opinion". 

He would like to see the budget include more opportunities for continuing apprenticeships and more financial support for necessities such as course books. 

Josh said he recently received a government grant to pay for essential job hunting equipment, such as a mobile phone, boots and suitable clothing. 

He added that he would support a rise in taxes if they were spent on investing in public services, "especially the train lines into London". 

Andrew, works in the security sector and lives in Peterborough in a home owned by the charity Hope Into Action.

The charity, which was set up in the city 15 years ago, owns 130 houses across the UK. 

Andrew has been a living in one of the charity's properties for two years, after experiencing homelessness for about "three or four months". 

"The charity saved my life," he said. 

He said renting in the private sector "can be expensive" but that people themselves have "got to budget as much as possible".  

In 2024 Peterborough City Council was contacted by 3,654 households facing homelessness, which was an 11% increase on the previous year.

The authority received nearly £1m last month to help tackle rough sleeping in the city. 

Andrew said he recognised that public services needed to be paid for and that if tax rises needed to happen to pay for them then "you've got to make good" yourself. 

HM Treasury was contacted for comment.

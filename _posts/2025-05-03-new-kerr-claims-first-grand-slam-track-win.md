Let's dive into the details: Josh Kerr is one 48 contracted Grand Slam Track 'racers' receiving a base salary to compete at all four slams

Britain's Josh Kerr claimed victory in the men's 1500m as the second meeting of the inaugural Grand Slam Track season got under way in Miami.

The world champion sprinted clear in the home straight for his first win of the series.

Kerr, who won silver at the Paris 2024 Olympics, clocked three minutes 34.51 seconds to finish ahead of Olympic bronze medallist Yared Nuguse and Olympic champion Cole Hocker.

The men's short distance contenders will also race over 800m on Saturday to determine the overall slam winner for the discipline - and the recipient of $100,000 (Â£79,500).

Two-time Olympic 100m medallist Fred Kerley did not compete in Miami after he was arrested by police on Friday, Grand Slam Track said in a statement.

Grand Slam Track - a concept conceived by four-time Olympic champion Michael Johnson - offers a $12.6m (Â£10m) prize pot in its first season.

The inaugural event took place in Kingston, Jamaica, last month but there were huge swathes of empty seats at the National Stadium throughout the three-day event.

Also on the opening day of action in Miami - the second of four slams - Olympic champion Masai Russell set an American record in the women's 100m hurdles in a time of 12.17 seconds, the second-fastest in history.

Compatriot Melissa Jefferson-Wooden won the women's 100m but her fast time of 10.75 was recorded with an illegal tailwind. Britain's Daryll Neita finished eighth in 11.16.

Briton George Mills, one of 48 'challengers' at the Miami event, was third in the men's 3,000m in 8:17.77 to give himself a chance of overall victory in Sunday's 5,000m.

Olympic 400m silver medallist Matthew Hudson-Smith placed seventh in the men's 200m in 20.64 before competing in his favoured full-lap event on Saturday.

Athletes receive points for their finishing position in both races, with their combined results determining the champion at each slam.

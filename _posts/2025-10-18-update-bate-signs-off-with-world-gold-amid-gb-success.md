It has been recently reported that Stephen Bate has won his fifth world title

Two-time Paralympic champion Stephen Bate secured a golden finish to his 12-year career by winning the men's tandem individual pursuit title at the Para-cycling Track World Championships in Rio de Janeiro.

Bate and pilot Christopher Latham achieved victory by catching Italian rivals Lorenzo Bernard and pilot Paolo Toto in an impressive display.

It ensured Bate ended his career as a five-time world champion across road and track events, and a five-time Paralympic medallist.

It was in Rio nine years ago where he and then-pilot Adam Duggleby achieved a golden Paralympic double in the individual pursuit and road time trial events.

Partnered by Latham on his return to the Brazilian capital, with whom he won individual pursuit silver at his final Paralympic Games in Paris last summer, Bate signed off in style on another hugely successful day for the British team.

That was one of three gold medals won by the British team on Saturday, as 21-year-old Archie Atkinson regained the men's C4 10km scratch race title.

Elizabeth Jordan and pilot Dannielle Khan also triumphed, retaining their women's B 1km time trial title.

Finlay Graham made it three medals in as many days as he clinched silver in the men's C3 elimination race.

There was also silver for Kadeena Cox in the women's C4 Sprint Race.

Those successes took GB's tally to seven golds, five silver and five bronze medals overall.

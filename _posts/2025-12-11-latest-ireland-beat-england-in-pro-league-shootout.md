Experts revealed that Ireland secured their first Pro League points in dramatic style

Ireland earned their first points in the FIH Pro League as they edged out England 4-3 in a dramatic shootout after a 1-1 draw in Dublin. 

Sarah Torrans gave the home side a first-half lead before Ellie Rayer equalised for England in the third quarter.

In heavy rain at the Sport Ireland campus, both sides looked happy with a point at the end, but it was Ireland who held their nerve in the shootout with goalkeeper Lizzie Murphy making the final stop to give the hosts the second point.

Charlotte Beggs, Mikayla Power and Hannah McLoughlin (2) scored for Ireland in the shootout, while Darcy Bourne, Rayer and Lily Owsley converted for England. 

"Weâre delighted. We started the game with a lot of energy and that was exactly what we wanted to do,â said Torrans.

"Unfortunately we couldn't hold them out for the win and but look it's a number of steps forward for us so we're happy right now."

Ireland - who lost to Belgium on Wednesday - controlled possession and territory for most of the first half, but it was England who squandered a golden opportunity to take the lead when Murphy saved a penalty stroke from Darcy Bourne.

However, Ireland's hard work and perseverance paid off before half-time when strong work from Katie Mullan and Mikayla Power set up Torrans for the opening goal.

âGetting the lead is so important in games like these," added Torrans. 

"We know we left chances out there and we'll look back on those going into the next few days. 

âYou know we have to take confidence in the chances that we did create and that's something we're working on as a team So yeah, hopefully we put a few more of them away."

Sarah Torrans scored the opener for Ireland

England improved after the interval and scored the equaliser with a well-worked county attack involving Tess Howard and Bourne and finished by Rayer.

After the final quarter ended tied, a dramatic shootout was needed to separate the sides.

At 2-2 Howard's effort was clearly outside of the eight seconds, but after Murphy was injured on the play, Ireland took too long to refer the decision to the third umpire and so the goal stood.

After Hannah McLoughlin scored and Murphy made a key save, Sarah Hawkshaw had two opportunities to win the game when England goalkeeper Miriam Pritchard was harshly adjudged to have impeded her the first time.

In sudden death, McLoughlin scored again and when Murphy saved from Sophie Hamilton, Ireland secured a second point.

However, Ireland's win possibly came at a price after Murphy left the ground in crutches.

Also in Dublin on Thursday, England's men secured a bonus point with a shootout victory over Belgium following a 2-2 draw.

Henry Croft's early goal gave England the lead but Belgium looked to have won the game after Arno Van Dessel and Nelson Onana struck in quick succession in the final quarter.

However, with less than 30 seconds left, Jacob Payton levelled it for England with a superb finish. 

Zac Wallace scored the pick of the goals in the shootout, with Tom Sorsby's effort clinching the extra point.

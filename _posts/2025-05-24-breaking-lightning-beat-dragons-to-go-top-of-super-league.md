Let's dive into the details: Loughborough Lightning secured their ninth win of the season to go top

Loughborough Lightning moved back to the top of the Netball Super League with a convincing win at Cardiff Dragons.

The reigning champions led from early in the first quarter and gradually extended their advantage to complete a comfortable 71-54 victory at Utilita Arena.

Lightning led 35-28 at half-time and never looked like letting that lead slip in a clinical display that saw them record a 93% shooting success, missing just four shots all game.

Goal shooter Samantha Wallace-Joseph top-scored for the visitors with 32 goals, while Dragons' Georgia Rowe had 35 goals in a losing cause.

Forest were 29-23 ahead at half-time but the Mavericks made a quick start to the third quarter and quickly got themselves on top.

Australian Emily Andrew continued her fine debut NSL season with 42 goals as Mavericks kept themselves in front to secure a seventh win of the campaign.

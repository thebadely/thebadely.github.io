According to new developments, Jennifer Falk saved four penalties against England last summer

Liverpool have signed Sweden goalkeeper Jennifer Falk on loan from BK Hacken for the rest of the season.

The 32-year-old saved four penalties in a dramatic shootout defeat by England at last summer's European Championship.

Falk becomes Liverpool's second signing this month from Hacken, after Alice Bergstrom signed last week.

Falk said: "I'm very happy and very excited, I'm looking forward to it. It's been a dream I've had to play in this league and this is a really big club so I'm really happy.

"I think the environment here is amazing, it's cosy but big, it has everything that you could need. It's a nice feeling seeing everything."

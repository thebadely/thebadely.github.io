It has been recently reported that Omari Hutchison won Euro 2025 with England Under-21s in Slovakia last month

Ipswich have turned down a Â£35m offer from Brentford for winger Omari Hutchinson. 

The Bees reached Hutchinson's relegation release clause but as the offer was not cash up front, it was rejected. 

The clause has now expired but BBC Sport has been told Brentford, under new boss Keith Andrews, are still keen on a deal for the 21-year-old.

But there is a reluctance from the Bees to pay what Ipswich want for the player and they are looking at other options.

Hutchinson could be a replacement for Manchester United target Bryan Mbeumo, but the 25-year-old Cameroon winger has not yet left the club.

Brentford have rejected two offers for Mbeumo from United, the second of which was worth up to Â£62.5m.

Hutchinson joined from Chelsea for Â£20m last summer after spending 2023-24 on loan at Portman Road, helping Ipswich into the Premier League.

He scored three goals in 31 league games last season but was unable to stop Kieran McKenna's side dropping back into the Championship.

Hutchinson also won Euro 2025 with England Under-21s last month, scoring in their extra-time final victory over Germany in Bratislava. 

Ipswich have already sold striker Liam Delap to Chelsea in a Â£30m deal after he scored 12 goals last season. 

Brentford signed former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson after his departure from Ajax, goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher from Liverpool, Antoni Milambo from Feyenoord and made Michael Kayode's loan from Fiorentina permanent.

It has been recently reported that Stuart Kettlewell left Motherwell in January

Kilmarnock have chosen Stuart Kettlewell to be their new manager, with an appointment imminent.

The former Motherwell and Ross County boss will replace Derek McInnes, who left the Rugby Park club to join Hearts last week.

Kettlewell, 40, left Motherwell in January citing personal abuse during a run of poor results.  

However, he impressed Kilmarnock chairman Billy Bowie and his fellow directors enough during interviews to be offered the job. Stevie Frail will again assist Kettlewell with Chris Burke and Craig Clark as coaches.

Scotland assistant John Carver and former Killie forward Steven Naismith had also been linked with the post.

Kilmarnock finished ninth in the 2024-25 Scottish Premiership.

Latest Kilmarnock news, analysis and fan views

In appointing a new manager, Kilmarnock have clearly been eager to avoid any of the complications that surrounded the departure of McInnes.

That all got a bit tricky with the mounting speculation followed by a defeat at Motherwell and the understandable dismay of some fans. 

The decision that McInnes wouldn't be in charge for the final match of the season against his prospective new employers was clearly an exercise in damage limitation.

Kettlewell was not an unexpected candidate. He is available and can point to a strong evidence of work at Motherwell and Ross County.

Now it looks like he will be given the chance to prove he can replicate that at Rugby Park.

Amy: Kettlewell would be a terrible choice. I've not seen one Kilmarnock fan who supports this. Cheap option and one that confirms us as bottom-six fodder.

David M: He didn't really get a chance at Motherwell. I always respect his honesty.

Adam: I'm not 100% sure about Kettlewell. I think John Carver might be a good choice though.

Ryan: Risk is a massive factor with Kettlewell. When you consider the manner in which he departed his previous position, surely it has to be considered a real possibility that he would walk again, on his own terms, if he wasn't happy?

John: Kettlewell or Carver would be my two.

Ross: Given some of the other names being touted, the prospect of Kettlewell is a little underwhelming. He didn't exactly set the heather on fire during his last job.

Taylor: The potential manager list has been very depressing, if it's to be Kettlewell I don't see him lasting past Christmas. Love to be wrong but I just can't see it.

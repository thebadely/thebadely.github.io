It has been recently reported that Jamison Gibson-Park, Hugo Keenan and Jamie Osborne all scored tries for Leinster

United Rugby Championship quarter-final

Leinster (15) 33

Tries: Lowe, Gibson-Park, Osborne, Keenan Pens: Prendergast 3 Con: Prendergast 2

Scarlets (14) 21

Tries Rogers, Murray, Williams Cons: Costelow 3

Leinster set up a United Rugby Championship semi-final against holders Glasgow with victory over Scarlets at Aviva Stadium. 

The Irish province, who finished the regular season top of the table, opened up an early lead thanks to James Lowe and Jamison Gibson-Park tries. 

However, eighth seeds Scarlets hit back through Tom Rogers and Blair Murray before half-time to keep alive hopes of a shock win in front of a crowd of 12,879. 

Jamie Osborne and Hugo Keenan stretched Leinster's lead in the second half before Johnny Williams' try breathed new life into Scarlets' challenge. 

But while the home side were far from their best, they were allowed to ease their way through the closing stages after Vaea Fifita's yellow card for a high tackle on Keenan took the wind out of the Scarlets' sails.  

While Scarlets' season comes to an end, they can look forward to a return to the Investec Champions Cup next term. 

Leinster, meanwhile, will face Glasgow - who they have beaten twice this season - at home next weekend for a place in the final on 14 June as they chase a first trophy since 2021.

There will, however, be concerns over British and Irish Lions flanker Josh van der Flier, who was forced off in the first half with a hamstring issue.

Could URC success salvage season for Leinster?

Coming into the game, Leinster had enough ammunition to guard against complacency, having fallen to the Scarlets in the URC last month before their European dreams were shattered by Northampton on this ground. 

However, despite racing into a 12-0 lead inside the opening 10 minutes, the firm favourites still made tough work of the first half.

British and Irish Lions squad members Lowe and Gibson-Park both crossed early to put the hosts in cruise control, but Scarlets - in their first play-off game since 2018 - were undeterred and hit back to cut the arrears to a point before the break. 

First, Rogers finished off a fine move in Scarlets' first visit to the Leinster 22 before a chaotic sequence to the opening half ended in Murray bringing the visitors back to within striking distance. 

In the last play before the interval, Leinster pushed for third try. But after Sam Prendergast spilled a pass in front of the Scarlets posts, Ellis Mee broke clear and Murray beat Jordie Barrett in a footrace to dot down, with the try standing after a television match official check on the full-back's grounding. 

Josh van der Flier, who was named in the British and Irish Lions squad earlier this month, was forced off in the first half 

With momentum on the side of a spirited Scarlets, Leinster rose to the challenge and responded strongly. 

Five minutes after the restart, Prendergast atoned for his part in Murray's score to send Osborne through with a well-judged chip for another try which stood after a TMO check for grounding. 

Having stretched their lead, Leinster showcased their impressive squad depth by introducing Ireland hooker Dan Sheehan and South Africa's two-time World Cup winner RG Snyman. 

And after Scarlets prop Alec Hepburn was sin-binned for playing the ball on the ground at a ruck, it was Sheehan who charged down a kick and gave Barrett the opportunity to send Keenan through for Leinster's fourth try.

With Scarlets boss Dwayne Peel having replaced fly-half Sam Costelow with Ioan Lloyd, Williams briefly revived Scarlets' dream of toppling the hosts when he brought the visitors back to within nine points.

However, after Fifita was sent to the bin, the game petered out, allowing Leinster to wrap up the win and set up a rematch with Glasgow. 

Leinster captain Jack Conan: "[We were] good in parts. Our discipline killed us, we gave them a lot of soft penalties. To be fair to Scarlets they stuck at it and battled hard, they're a team with a lot of passion and they pushed us at times. 

"We were inaccurate and forced things a little bit. It's good to have another week but there were some frustrating bits there. 

"Lads want to have big moments They want to feel like they're doing well, but sometimes there's a bit of over-eagerness and over-zealousness. 

"You force things a little bit and get away with things although I thought Hollie [Davidson] was on the money today. I don't think it's anything other than lads trying a bit too hard."

Scarlets captain Josh Macleod: "At half-time there was plenty of belief, but I'm extremely proud of the bunch. They're a top group of guys but today we just came up short.

"I think we were the only people in the UK with any sort of belief going into today. The media thought it would be a runaway win for them. We didn't and hopefully for large parts of the game we showed that."

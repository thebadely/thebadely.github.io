According to new developments, Sanchez joined Chelsea for Â£25m from Brighton in 2023

Chelsea manager Liam Rosenior says he is "accountable" for Robert Sanchez's mistakes as he defended his goalkeeper following the 3-2 Carabao Cup semi-final first-leg loss by Arsenal.

The Spain international, 28, was arguably at fault for Arsenal's first two goals at Stamford Bridge, with Rosenior revealing his squad had also been hit by injury and illness.

Sanchez failed to claim Declan Rice's corner for the seventh-minute opener, allowing Ben White to turn the ball in, while the Gunners full-back's cross then squirmed through the goalkeeper's grasp for Viktor Gyokeres to score from close range in the 49th minute. 

Arsenal's Martin Zubimendi also found the net, but Chelsea substitute Alejandro Garnacho struck twice to keep his side in the tie.

In his first home game as Blues boss, Rosenior revealed he is working on a new tactical approach for Sanchez.

"It's a team goal, it's not just on Rob [Sanchez]," he said. "I'm asking Rob to do things that he hasn't done before. I said to him before the game, and I made this really clear, when my players make mistakes, I'm accountable. That's on me. 

"He made a save in the second half that was absolutely world-class. That could have put us out of the tie. He will improve in terms of his understanding.

"That's Rob's first game with me, I've had two days' work with him. I have to put my imprint on the team. That's why I'm here. 

"I don't want to do that to the detriment of the results, but I need to make sure we win now, but we keep improving for where we want to get to this season. It's a very fine margin. 

"There are a lot of positives in Rob's performance. What you'll know with me is I protect my players. I'm asking him to do things. If he makes a mistake, doing what I'm asking him to do, that's on me. 

"I have a lot of faith that in the long term we'll improve as a team with the messages that we're giving him in all the plays. My job is to help them, not to blame them."

Arsenal take step to ending semi-final nightmares - but regrets remain

Rosenior was broadly pleased with his team despite the defeat - his first since taking charge - and highlighted positives in almost every individual performance.

"The biggest problem for us is that we had a lot of illness, injury and we're playing against a very, very good team," added Rosenior.

Cole Palmer, Reece James and Malo Gusto all failed late fitness tests, while Moises Caicedo was suspended and illness forced Liam Delap and Jamie Gittens on the sidelines too.

On Palmer, Rosenior said: "He had a minor strain in his thigh. If you play a player too early in January with a minor strain, it can turn into six weeks out. I can't afford to lose Cole Palmer for six weeks because he's that good."

He added James had "a big knock on his hip", but "hopefully he will be back for Saturday".

"Gittens was ill last night, Liam Delap was due to play - he was ill four hours before the game," said Rosenior.

"Both of them had really high temperatures - dangerously high. Hopefully they can rest up and will be OK for Saturday."

Rosenior was keen to point out Chelsea had competed well against an Arsenal side that had lost only twice in all competitions this season, and his team can still fight back in the second leg at Emirates Stadium on 3 February.

"We're playing probably the best pressing team in Europe today, with their fullâstrength team, and we're missing a lot of players," he added.

"I was proud of the bravery of the players to try to execute certain aspects of what I asked. In six days, we've had two games. I'm not asking for time because I think the group are good enough to win now.

"But I need to put my stamp on the team as well - otherwise there's no point in me being here. So it's a fine balance, and hopefully the fans will see the progression in the team. But we need to win at the same time."

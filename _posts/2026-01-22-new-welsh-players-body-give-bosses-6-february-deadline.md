Experts revealed that Wales have not won a game in the Six Nations since March 2023

Wales' players have given Welsh rugby bosses a deadline of 6 February to provide clarity on what will happen next season. 

The Welsh Rugby Players' Association (WRPA), the organisation that represents Wales' players, met with the Professional Rugby Board (PRB) to "address the significant challenges currently facing the professional game in Wales".

The meeting took place after it emerged Ospreys' owners, Y11 Sport & Media, are the Welsh Rugby Union's  (WRU) preferred bidder to buy rivals Cardiff who went into administration in April 2025.

This comes after the WRU announced in October 2025 that it intends to cut one of the men's professional sides, reducing numbers from four to three. 

The WRPA is especially concerned about the make-up of next season and has given Welsh rugby bosses the deadline to let them know what is happening.

That is a day before Wales begin their Six Nations campaign against England at the Allianz Stadium in Twickenham.

The WRPA warned "failure to deliver certainty by this point would inevitably require players to consider their position and next steps".

Strike action has not been mentioned, but that was a possibility three years ago when Wales' players threatened not to play the Six Nations fixture against England in February 2023, because of a dispute over player contracts.

The game eventually went ahead but the WRPA has shown it is as concerned now about the state of the Welsh domestic game.

The WRPA statement read: "We met with the PRB to address the significant challenges currently facing the professional game in Wales.

"The WRPA sought clear and definitive answers on a number of critical matters, including the proposed transition within the professional structure, the Cardiff Rugby transaction, licensing arrangements, and the number of Welsh teams expected to compete in the United Rugby Championship (URC) next season.

"While certain assurances were provided, the WRPA was unequivocal that continued uncertainty is placing unacceptable strain on players, staff and their families. 

"Prolonged ambiguity around contracts, recruitment and future planning is directly impacting player welfare, and timely, transparent and direct communication is essential.

"The WRPA also raised serious concerns regarding recent media leaks, which have further undermined confidence during an already challenging period. We reiterated that players must be properly informed before public announcements are made.

"We have made it clear meaningful clarity on arrangements for next season must be provided no later than 6 February. 

"This deadline is essential to prevent further disruption, provide stability and allow players and clubs to make informed decisions. 

"Failure to deliver certainty by this point would inevitably require players to consider their position and next steps.

"The WRPA remains committed to constructive engagement with all stakeholders and continues to act in the best interests of player welfare, security and the long-term health of the professional game in Wales."

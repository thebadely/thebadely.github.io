Experts revealed that Millions of households in England will have to pay even higher water bills than had previously been announced, after five water companies appealed to the UK's competition regulator.

The companies - Anglian, Northumbrian, Southern, Wessex and South East - had appeals to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) accepted, giving them permission to raise bills still further.

They had argued that the price rises set by the sector's regulator Ofwat - which average 36% over the next five years â€“ were not enough to deliver the needed investment in infrastructure.

The CMA said the five companies could raise bills by on average an additional 3% more than the original Ofwat decision.

The five water companies serve over 7 million household and business customers.

Troubled firm Thames Water also appealed, but has deferred its case until late October while it tries to fix a rescue bid.

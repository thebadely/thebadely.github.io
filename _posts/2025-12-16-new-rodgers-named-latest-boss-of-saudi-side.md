Let's dive into the details: Brendan Rodgers has been appointed manager of Saudi Pro League side Al-Qadsiah.

Rodgers, who has previously led teams including Liverpool and Leicester City, left Celtic in October after guiding the Scottish giants to back-to-back league titles during his second spell in charge.

His exit from the Glasgow club was marked by controversy, after majority shareholder Dermot Desmond described Rodgers' behaviour as "divisive, misleading, and self-serving".

Al-Qadsiah chief executive James Bisgrove, who previously held the same role with Rangers, told club media the arrival of Rodgers was "a landmark moment", adding: "The calibre of his experience and track record of winning reflects our ambition and long-term vision to establish Al-Qadsiah as one of Asia's leading clubs."

Rodgers, who will be joined by former Celtic coaches John Kennedy and Jack Lyons, replaces Spanish boss Michel, who parted ways with the club after over two years in charge.

Former Real Madrid defender Nacho and Italian striker Mateo Retegui play for Al-Qadsiah, who sit fifth in the Saudi top flight after nine games.

It has been recently reported that Sean Dyche has signed a deal with Nottingham Forest until summer 2027

New Nottingham Forest boss Sean Dyche wants his under-performing stars to reconnect with disillusioned supporters.

The 54-year-old became Forest's third manager in six weeks when he replaced Ange Postecoglou on Tuesday.

Postecoglou was dismissed 39 days after he came in for the sacked Nuno Espirito Santo on 9 September.

Former Tottenham boss Postecoglou struggled to win over supporters, who chanted he would be "sacked in the morning" during a 3-2 Europa League defeat by Midtjylland last month.

Dyche came through the Forest academy in the 1980s, although he never made a first-team appearance, and is eager to unify the City Ground.

"We want to get back on the front foot, in old football terminology, and hopefully give the crowd something to cheer about and reconnect," Dyche told BBC Radio Nottingham.

"The Forest fans in my experience have been very fair down the years and I don't think it's far away from the team reconnecting. The first thing is performances, get them back on that winning edge they have shown."

Is Dyche the right man to repair Forest?

Forest finished seventh in the Premier League last season under Nuno, their highest placing for 30 years, but they sit 18th and have not won since the opening day of this campaign.

They face Porto in the Europa League in Dyche's first game on Thursday before travelling to Bournemouth on Sunday.

Forest have not kept a clean sheet for 20 games, since beating Manchester United in April. They will host United at the City Ground on 1 November.

"The basics have always got to be in place," said Dyche.

"Strong, fit and organised is a good start point, I want the players to have their freedom to go and play.

"I've had a meeting with them, expressed that, and there's some talent here. So how can we find that balance, the risk and rewards going forward to score goals but also the base which has been such a good weapon for Forest?

"[It's about] reassuring them what good players we think they are and a reminder of what they have already done, how we can bring consistency and all the things they've done and take it forward.

"Don't just rely on the past. That can be respected, but how can we build that forwards?"

Dyche said the team are "still a work in progress" as Forest look to get back to the level on the pitch they were at during his time in the academy.

"When I was here 1987-90, that team was finishing regularly in the top six of the old First Division and winning the Littlewoods Trophy [the EFL Cup] as it was then," he said.

"We're not quite there yet, the fans know that and the club knows that, but it's about building that momentum and obviously it's just lost its way a little bit."

Dyche left Forest for Chesterfield in 1990, spending seven years in defence with the Spirerites, before playing for Bristol City, Millwall, Watford and Northampton.

He has been out of work since a two-year spell at Everton ended in January, having previously spent 10 years as Burnley boss until 2022.

Speaking about his Forest past, Dyche said: "Everyone knows down the years I've spoken about my affection and the beginning of my career which was under the great Brian Clough.

"I didn't quite force my way into the first team, I had three years as an apprentice and a young pro and learnt so much.

"I have fond memories of wandering down the Trent with Del Boy [Clough's dog] running past your feet and hearing the boss' voice in the distance. It's a strange thing to be back, but it's a good thing and a very pleasing thing.

"It's one of those things, you imagine one day could it be? Not in the early days of my managerial career, but as things started changing in my career and changing at Nottingham Forest, new ownership comes in and the growth, they have made you wonder.

"It's come round my way, I'm very pleased and proud."

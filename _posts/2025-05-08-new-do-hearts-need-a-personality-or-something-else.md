According to new developments, A Hearts flag draped at a managerless Tynecastle

"Follow the Hearts and you can't go wrong."

The line from the Edinburgh club's anthem seems a tad out of place these days as it bellows around a gloomy Tynecastle.

The Hearts board are about to lurch into a third managerial search in three years, the mood accentuated with a faint flirt at a relegation play-off fight fading amid the backdrop of a bottom-six finish.

It's quite the tumble from a season which started with bumper crowds and European football, culminating in the exit of Neil Critchley last month.

But with Tony Bloom bidding just under Â£10m for a big wedge in the club, there's perhaps even more importance on getting the next appointment right.

So, what, and more importantly who, can fans expect?

Names will fly as to who is among in the runners and riders to replace Critchley, with Kilmarnock's Derek McInnes the fans' front runners.

St Mirren boss Stephen Robinson and the now Championship-winning Falkirk manager John McGlynn, are also in the conversation.

The latter has already taken charge of the club for eight months in 2012, so at least knows what it takes to do the job. 

But what kind of person is needed to put Hearts back where their supporters feel they should be?

"We need a personality," Hearts goalkeeper Craig Gordon told BBC Scotland. 

"It's tough at times at Hearts, especially when things aren't going well. The fans are expectant and they'll let us know if it's not good enough. 

"So we need to be able to deal with that and that goes for everybody at the club."

Tough times have not been uncommon this season.

Steven Naismith departed in September after an eight-game losing streak, while Critchley's tenure ended after blowing a shot at the top six during a five-game winless run.

Asked if the new boss needs to have a presence, forward Alan Forrest said: "Yes, I think so. 

"I think everybody will say the same, you've got to have that respect, but I think it works both ways as well and I think if you get that respect the players will play for the manager as well so I think that's important."

Being a bit of a character and having a skin thicker than the solid stone walls of Edinburgh Castle is one thing, but a football philosophy that backs it up is also required here.

The Gorgie side sit in the odd position of having a goal difference of zero. Five teams have scored more than them, while only Celtic, Rangers and Hibernian have conceded fewer goals.

Delving into the data, the stats show that Hearts don't make the most of their possession and chances, something articulated with Lawrence Shankland's goal tally sitting at a modest seven for the season.

While Hearts are eighth in the Premiership table, looking at the xG (expected goals) points table, the Tynecastle side should currently be fourth on 51 points.

"I think the message is clear for the players, playing a positive style," said Forrest. 

"Every player wants that, playing on the front foot, so it's just about that for me, being positive and taking the game to teams."

For caretaker Liam Fox, the mission for the new boss is simple.

"They need to win games first and foremost," he said. "I know that sounds really simple, but it's not for me to sit here and tell you what a Hearts manager is.

"It's just finding what works for that group of players and that can take a wee bit of time."

The sense of urgency to appoint a successor to Critchley has slowed after the threat of being dragged into a relegation fight eased with Saturday's win over Ross County.

However, don't doubt work is going in behind the scenes to ensure who is given the nod is the right person to take over.

Saturday's match at home to Motherwell is an ideal opportunity for the board to gather and finalise either a preferred candidate, or at least whittle it down to a couple of names.

Over the past few days, McInnes has leapt towards the top of the pile in terms of supporter satisfaction.

The 53-year-old has been a regular name whenever the Hearts job has become available. It's not a surprise given he guided Kilmarnock to Europe last season and spent eight years at Aberdeen.

With Jamestown Analytics also having input, other names will be in the frame but, as things stand, McInnes is the front runner.

Experts revealed that Kayla Harrison joined the UFC in January 2024

Warning: This article contains an account of sexual abuse.

Kayla Harrison never holds back when telling her story of sexual abuse because she wants to give young victims hope.

"There is a shiny gold medal at the end of the tunnel. There is a UFC belt at the end of the tunnel - but you have to say something and we have to keep talking about it," says Harrison.

As a child, Harrison was abused by her judo coach. After her mother reported it to the police, he was arrested, found guilty and sentenced to 10 years in prison.

Harrison is a double Olympic gold medallist judoka and two-time Professional Fighters League (PFL) champion, who has used her status as one of the world's best athletes to raise awareness of child sexual abuse.

In 2018 she wrote a book with the aim of educating parents on how to spot signs that a child is being groomed so they can take preventative action. 

Now, the 34-year-old has her biggest platform to raise awareness of the issue.

On Saturday she will face fellow American Julianna Pena for the bantamweight title at UFC 316 in Newark, New Jersey.

"I'm no longer that 10-year-old girl, that 16-year-old girl. I'm an adult now and I feel god gave me this story for a reason and it's my job to use it to make the world a better place. I want to talk about it," said Harrison.

"It is important to me. I don't ever want another little boy or girl to feel alone, to feel dirty, to feel ashamed. There is hope."

Harrison joined the UFC last year, submitting Holly Holm on her debut in April before earning a decision win over Ketlen Vieira in October.

Pena, 35, won the bantamweight title with a split-decision win over Raquel Pennington in October and is making the first defence of her reign.

As she has done against previous opponents, Pena has tried to gain a mental advantage by trash talking in recent weeks - but Harrison believes it has helped her own stock rise.

"Julianna is the perfect villain to make me a hero," said Harrison. 

"I don't know if it's my dominance, or because I'm so physically strong-looking, or maybe because I haven't been in the UFC for too long, but I felt people weren't too keen on me.

"But now I feel like I'm America's sweetheart, I'm just gonna take it and run with it."

Harrison switched to mixed martial arts (MMA) from judo, making her professional debut in 2018 before winning 18 of her 19 professional bouts.

She was driven by trophies and success during her glittering judo career, but has largely been spurred on by her family since starting MMA.

In 2020, Harrison adopted her niece Kyla and nephew Emery when her stepdad, who was looking after the children at the time, died suddenly.

Harrison says "this belt is for me" when asked what winning a UFC title would feel like, and points to the experience she has gained as a mother in fuelling her ambition.

"My kids have taught me there's so much more to life than gold medals and trophies. Everyone always asks me where I keep my Olympic gold medals - they're in my sock drawer collecting dust," said Harrison.

"Nobody cares - my kids sure don't care. They care I come home. I'm mum and play Nerf gun wars with them, let them have ice cream - that's what it's all about.

"It's given me a new peace, a new understanding, a new freedom, and it's made me a better fighter."

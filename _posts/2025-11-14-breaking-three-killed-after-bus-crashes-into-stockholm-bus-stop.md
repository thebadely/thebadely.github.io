Let's dive into the details: Three people have been killed and and another three injured after a bus crashed into a bus stop in central Stockholm, Swedish police say.

Circumstances surrounding Friday's crash at 15:23 (14:23 GMT) on the Valhallavägen street in the Swedish capital remain unclear.

The bus driver has been arrested and faces charges of causing death and bodily harm, police said in a statement.

However, they added there was "currently no indication that the incident was intentional".

Officials are trying to establish the identities of the victims. It is not clear if there were passengers on board. 

The incident occurred near the Royal Institute of Technology university.

Images from the scene show rescue crews appearing to help people trapped underneath the double-decker bus.

A witness who owns a shop on the street told SVT the bus hit a pole in front of the bus shelter. They said several people ran into the shop crying.

A woman told the local Expressen newspaper that the bus "mowed down an entire bus stop queue". 

She said people were screaming and trying to help the injured, while dead people lay on the ground.

"There must have been more people under the bus," she said.

Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said his thoughts were with the victims and their families.

"People who might have been on their way home to family, friends, or a quiet evening at home. We do not yet know the cause, but right now my thoughts are primarily with those affected and their loved ones," he posted on X.

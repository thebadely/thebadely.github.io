Let's dive into the details: Anthony Yarde (right) made his debut in 2015 and is looking to win a world title at the third attempt 

Briton Anthony Yarde says he is a "better fighter now" than during his previous title challenges as he aims to finally become a world champion at the third attempt.

The 34-year-old fights undefeated champion David Benavidez for the WBC light-heavyweight title in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on Saturday.

Yarde has twice fallen short, losing to Sergey Kovalev in 2019 and Artur Beterbiev four years later - and many view this as his last realistic chance to win a world title.

"I keep hearing 'three time's a charm' or 'third time lucky'. I don't really believe in luck. I feel like I'm a better fighter now," he said.

The 28-year-old Benavidez, an American of Mexican heritage, has stopped 24 of his 30 opponents and is a former two-time super-middleweight champion.

Nicknamed the "Mexican Monster", he promised a "war".

"I've had my eye on Anthony Yarde for a long time. He has power and heart. No matter who he faces, it's a good fight," added the Phoenix-born Benavidez.

"I want to give people action-packed fights. This one is going to live up to the moment."

Earlier, heated words between the camps of WBO welterweight champion Brian Norman Jr and fellow American challenger Devin Haney - who meet on the undercard - led to security stepping in as Haney's father Bill moved toward Norman's father Brian Sr.

In contrast, there was mutual respect between the headliners, with Yarde and Benavidez sharing smiles and a warm embrace during their face-off.

Yarde enters the bout with 27 wins from 30 contests. When reminded of a previous interview in which he claimed he would put Benavidez to sleep, the Londoner joked: "Did I say that?"

Dressed in a crisp white tracksuit and sunglasses, Yarde reflected on the setbacks he has faced at the highest level.

"I feel this is the best version of me. I always said I didn't want an easy route," he added.

"I don't want to win vacant titles. That's why I went to Russia to face Kovalev. People told me not to fight Beterbiev - I don't care.

"The better the fighter, the bigger the reward. This occasion feels right."

Despite an aggressive reputation in the ring, Benavidez showed a softer side as his two children joined him on stage.

He has targeted a unification fight with light-heavyweight Dmitry Bivol if he beats Yarde, but is not overlooking the Briton.

Promoter Frank Warren described Sam Noakes (right) as "one of the best young fighters in the UK"

Maidstone lightweight Sam Noakes challenges American Abdullah Mason for the vacant WBO title on the undercard.

The 28-year-old has stopped 15 of 17 opponents, but is the underdog against the highly-rated Mason.

Ohio's Mason has an even more destructive record, with 17 stoppages in 19 victories, and another success would make the 21-year-old boxing's youngest reigning world champion.

"Boxing gets to gain its favourite young new talent and I'll be dominating the division from Saturday forward," he said. 

But a confident Noakes predicted a knockout, saying being the outsider means "everyone betting on me will win a lot of money".

Britain started the week with only two male world champions - Nick Ball (WBA featherweight) and Lewis Crocker (IBF welterweight).

Fabio Wardley was then elevated to WBO heavyweight champion on Tuesday after Oleksandr Usyk vacated.

Wins for Noakes and Yarde on Saturday could make it five male world champions.

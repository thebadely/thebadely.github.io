Seven-time champion Novak Djokovic outclassed Dan Evans in what could be the British veteran's final appearance at Wimbledon.

Evans, now ranked 154th in the world and given a wildcard to play at the All England Club, lost 6-3 6-2 6-0 in their second-round match.

Serb great Djokovic, 38, produced a serving masterclass which even left Evans shaking his head in disbelief at several points.

The 35-year-old home favourite, who was willed on by an encouraging Centre Court crowd, won just nine of his 58 receiving points (16%) in the match.

Djokovic, seeded sixth this year, also demonstrated why he is still one of the best returners in the men's game by converting six of his 16 break points.

It was an impressive display from the 24-time Grand Slam champion, who is aiming to equal his rival Roger Federer's record tally of Wimbledon men's singles titles.

Djokovic is also trying to finally land a standalone record 25th major, having not claimed one of the sport's most prestigious prizes since the 2023 US Open.

"Everyone knew it was going to be a special atmosphere today â a Brit in Britain is never easy to face," said Djokovic, who earned his 99th match win at Wimbledon.

"He's a good quality player who possesses a lot of great talent, a great touch and, with the ball staying low with the slice, it can cause trouble if you're not at the top of your game.

"But I think was. I executed perfectly. Sometimes you have these days where everything flows."

Djokovic's win teed up an all-Serb contest against Miomir Kecmanovic in the third round, with a place in the last 16 on the line.

With Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal having retired, Djokovic is the last of the 'Big Three' still playing.

Eyeing a record 25th Grand Slam title, Djokovic said he has no time to think about joining his former rivals in retirement.

"I don't pause to reflect, to be honest. I don't have time," he said.

"I think that's going to come probably when I set the racquet aside and then sip margaritas on the beach with Federer and Nadal and just reflect on our rivalry and everything.

"If I play like today, I feel like I have a very good chance against anybody, really, on the Centre Court of Wimbledon, a place where I maybe feel the most comfortable on any court."

Stepping out again on Centre Court, this time to face arguably the greatest men's player of all time, was a rich reward for Evans.

A loss of form and injuries over the past couple of seasons led to a brief exile outside the top 200 earlier this year.

The strain of the ageing process and an inescapable feeling of "letting down" his family and supporters have been particularly difficult to deal with.

It led to Evans becoming overcome with emotion in his pre-tournament news conference at Wimbledon when he opened up about his feelings.

The enthusiasm with which the former world number 21 celebrated beating fellow British wildcard Jay Clarke in the first round illustrated his delight at earning another priceless victory at Wimbledon.

While Evans has indicated he has no plans yet to retire, he also knows there is not much mileage left on the clock of his career.

Asked if this could be his final Wimbledon, he said: "I don't know. See what this year brings.

"I have to decide at the end of the year. There will definitely be some sort of chat at the end of the year [about] what I want to do.

"It's not getting any easier, that's for sure. Waking up after playing matches is hard now."

Dan Evans has lost all four of his Wimbledon matches on Centre Court - including a 2016 defeat by Roger Federer

Evans, whose victory over Clarke was his first at the All England Club since 2021, knew there would be no better place to create a shock than beating Djokovic on Centre Court.

But it quickly became clear the gulf in class between the pair was too much.

Evans hung tough in the first set before finally buckling on the 10th break point he faced at 4-3, with Djokovic going on to win 13 of the next 15 games to secure a straightforward victory.

The majority of the 15,000 crowd waited patiently for Evans to pack his racquet bag, so they could send him off the most famous court in the sport with a passionate ovation.

"I believed I could win the match. I felt confident going into the match," Evans said.

"I understand the occasion and what a moment it was for myself. Of course, it's disappointing, but I'll look back with a proud happiness."

This was Jack Pinnington Jones' main draw debut at Wimbledon

Evans was one of three British singles players to exit Wimbledon on Thursday, with wildcards Jack Pinnington Jones and Arthur Fery being beaten by Italian opponents.

Pinnington Jones, who made his debut at the Championships this year, lost 6-1 7-6 (8-6) 6-2 to Flavio Cobolli.

Fery, meanwhile, trailed Luciano Darderi by two sets when play was suspended on Tuesday and he was unable to stage a comeback once the match resumed, losing 6-4 6-3 6-3.

A record 36 seeds have exited Wimbledon after two rounds - 19 men and 17 women.

British world number four Jack Draper, American Tommy Paul, Czech player Tomas Machac and Canada's Felix Auger-Aliassime became the latest seeded players to exit the men's draw on Thursday.

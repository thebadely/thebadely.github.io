Here’s what you need to know: Aston Villa have already rejected one Manchester United attempt to sign goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez

The future of Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez remains uncertain amid interest from Manchester United.

The 32-year-old was not included in Villa's matchday squad on Sunday as they fell to a 3-0 defeat at home to Crystal Palace.

After the game, manager Unai Emery told Sky Sports the club "have to fix" the situation. 

He added: "One of the situations we are speaking about is Emi Martinez, but we will see tomorrow. We have to fix it with him."

Aston Villa are yet to win a Premier League game this season, losing two and drawing one of their opening three games. 

They are also the only club across England's top four divisions to have not scored a league goal so far this season.

When asked by BBC Match of the Day whether the club are looking to do any further transfer business before Monday's 19:00 BST deadline, Emery said: "We need others, of course. 

"I am happy with the players we have, but we have to get something more in the squad.

"We have some circumstances that are not helping us. Tomorrow the transfer window is finishing. Hopefully, we can keep balance with the squad after it."

When asked about Martinez's situation by Sky Sports before kick-off, the Villa boss simply answered "Bizot" to each question - a reference to goalkeeper Marco Bizot who was starting the match.

Palace defender Marc Guehi, the subject of a Â£35m bid by Liverpool, was named in his side's starting line-up, scoring the second of their three goals at Villa Park.

Manchester United are keen to address their goalkeeping issues, considering a move for Argentina keeper Martinez and negotiating with Royal Antwerp about their highly rated 23-year-old Belgian Senne Lammens.

Lammens wants to join United and has been left out of Antwerp's past two games. It is known the Belgian Pro League club need to make a sizeable sale so they can meet an external loan they have previously taken out, and Villa have also been linked should Martinez depart.

However, Lammens lacks high-level experience, while Martinez is a World Cup winner and a two-time Fifa goalkeeper of the year with 197 Premier League appearances under his belt.

After Saturday's 3-2 victory over Burnley, United head coach Ruben Amorim admitted: "I think it is hard to be a Manchester United goalkeeper in this moment."

Man Utd's vital win can't mask urgent goalkeeping issues

Current keepers Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana have each made mistakes already this season. Bayindir's latest blunder would have cost United victory against Burnley had it not been for Bruno Fernandes' injury-time penalty.

Turkish side Galatasaray are interested in Lammens, but could also move for Bayindir or Onana, should United decide the Belgium youth international is their preferred option.

It is being stressed by United sources they will only sign one goalkeeper at most before the window closes at 19:00 BST on Monday.

They did inquire about taking Martinez on loan at the start of the summer, but Villa told them they were not interested.

He appeared to say farewell to the club's supporters at the end of last season, but featured in last week's defeat at Brentford.

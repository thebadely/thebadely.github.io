Experts revealed that Reece Walsh received the Clive Churchill Medal as man of the match in Sunday's NRL Grand Final

Reece Walsh has capped a remarkable season by winning his first Australia call-up for the three-Test Ashes series in England that begins later this month.

The 23-year-old full-back - man of the match as Brisbane Broncos won Sunday's NRL Grand Final - is one of seven new faces in head coach Kevin Walters' 24-player squad.

Rugby union convert Mark Nawaqanitawase, who played for the Wallabies at the 2023 World Cup, is set to become a dual code international as another first-time call-up.

Nawaqanitawase, 25, earned his spot after a spectacular first full season in the NRL with Sydney Roosters, finishing as the competition's leading try-scorer.

He has been selected even though he is set to return to union at the end of next season to prepare for the 2027 World Cup, which will be held in Australia.

Gehamat Shibasaki, who played alongside Walsh on Sunday as the Broncos beat Melbourne Storm in Sydney to win their first NRL title for 19 years, has also been named in an Australia squad for the first time.

Blayke Brailey, Keaon Koloamatangi, Jacob Preston and Ethan Strange complete the list of new call-ups.

Nathan Cleary leads a host of star names in Australia's squad, which will be captained by Penrith Panthers team-mate Isaah Yeo.

Australia face England at Wembley on 25 October, at Everton's Hill Dickinson Stadium on 1 November and at AMT Headingley on 8 November. All three matches are 14:30 kick-offs and will be live on BBC One.

Walters said: "There is a mix of youth and experience and all of them have the desire to represent their country on this stage. I cannot wait to coach this squad.

"England will be a huge test on their home soil. However, this squad knows what it takes to perform at the highest level and knows what it takes to win."

Mark Nawaqanitawase scored 24 tries in the NRL this season

Full-back Walsh will compete with Dylan Edwards for a spot in the starting line-up, with former captain James Tedesco ruling himself out last week in order to attend his brother's wedding in November.

Walsh produced an extraordinary performance in the Grand Final as the Broncos recovered from 10 points down at half-time to win 26-22.

He scored a memorable try, beating five opponents to score under the posts, provided three assists and made a dramatic try-saving tackle on Ryan Papenhuyzen when outnumbered two to one in the final seconds.

Broncos team-mate Ben Hunt paid tribute by calling him an "absolute freak".

There was controversy too. Walsh avoided a sin-binning but was fined A$3,000 (Â£1,475) for a high tackle on Xavier Coates, who is also in the Australia squad.

Isaah Yeo (captain), Blayke Brailey, Patrick Carrigan, Nathan Cleary, Xavier Coates, Lindsay Collins, Reuben Cotter, Angus Crichton, Tom Dearden, Dylan Edwards, Tino Fa'asuamaleaui, Harry Grant (vice-captain), Keaon Koloamatangi, Zac Lomax, Mitchell Moses, Cameron Munster, Mark Nawaqanitawase, Jacob Preston, Gehamat Shibasaki, Lindsay Smith, Kotoni Staggs, Ethan Strange, Reece Walsh, Hudson Young.

Watching Reece Walsh in Sunday's NRL Grand Final will have filled the British rugby league public with a strange mix of fear and joy - all too aware, in the hours before it was announced, that he was set to be named in Australia's squad to face England.

As Brisbane Broncos triumphed, Walsh delivered a freakish performance of defensive desperation and heart, aligned with devastating attacking impact, on the big stage. He is going to wow the series if England don't get to grips with him - and that's assuming he pips Penrith's equally talented Dylan Edwards to the jersey.

Unnervingly for Shaun Wane and the England squad, they're not the only superstars selected. Winger Mark Nawaqanitawase has shone in 2025, being named NRL rookie of the year for his displays on the wing for the Roosters and a back catalogue of eye-opening tries.

Other names have been rewarded for their form as well, with Canberra's Ethan Strange and Walsh's Broncos team-mate Gehamat Shibasaki among the newbies, while old hands such as Cam Munster, Nathan Cleary and captain Isaah Yeo are involved too.

There are some battle-hardened forwards heading north this autumn: Man mountain Keaon Koloamatangi returns wearing green and gold, having toured with Tonga in 2023, while Patrick Carrigan, Lindsay Collins and Tino Fa'asuamaleaui bring power and presence for Harry Grant at hooker to play off.

England rightly have high hopes after back-to-back series wins over Tonga and Samoa, but this squad is just a little reminder of why the Kangaroos are still the world's number one.

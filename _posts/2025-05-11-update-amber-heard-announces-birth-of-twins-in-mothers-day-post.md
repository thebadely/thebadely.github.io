Experts revealed that Amber Heard has announced the arrival of twins in an Instagram post shared on Mother's Day in the United States. 

The American actor revealed that she had welcomed daughter Agnes and son Ocean and was "elated beyond words" to celebrate the "completion" of her family. 

Heard, 39, welcomed her first daughter, Oonagh, in 2021. 

Under a picture of three pairs of feet, Heard wrote: "Becoming a mother by myself and on my own terms despite my own fertility challenges has been the most humbling experience of my life." 

The actor said she had chosen motherhood "responsibly and thoughtfully" and "couldn't possibly burst with more joy". 

She described her family as one she had "strived to build for years".

"To all the moms, wherever you are today and however you got here, my dream family and I are celebrating with you," she added. 

When Heard announced the birth of her first daughter in 2021, she spoke about her desire for it to be "normalised to not want a ring in order to have a crib".

"I now appreciate how radical it is for us as women to think about one of the most fundamental parts of our destinies in this way," she wrote on Instagram at the time. 

Heard is best known for her films The Rum Diary, Drive Angry, Zombieland and Aquaman.

She was married to actor Johnny Depp from 2015 to 2016. 

After their marriage ended, the pair accused each other of domestic abuse and engaged in two lengthy and high-profile defamation cases.

In the Depp v. News Group Newspapers (NGN) trial in 2020, Depp lost his UK libel case against the Sun newpaper after Heard gave evidence to back claims in the newspaper that he was a "wife-beater".

In the widely publicised Depp v. Heard trial in the US, Heard was found liable for defaming Depp. 

For six weeks in 2022, a court in the US state of Virginia heard details of the couple's volatile relationship. 

Depp sued his ex-wife for defamation over an opinion article she wrote for the Washington Post that alleged she was a domestic abuse victim, although it did not mention him by name. Heard counter-sued.

Jurors awarded Depp - who denied abusing Heard - $15m (Â£12m) in compensatory and punitive damages.

Heard won one of three counter-claims against Depp and was awarded $2m in compensatory damages.

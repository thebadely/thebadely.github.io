It has been recently reported that Sanchez has worked as a pundit for Fox Sports since 2021

Former NFL quarterback Mark Sanchez has been released from hospital and prison after he was stabbed in Indianapolis and arrested for his role in the incident.

In a condition set by a judge, the 38-year-old had to be processed, which involved him having his fingerprints recorded and a head and shoulders photo taken, at Marion County Jail after leaving hospital.

He was then released and briefly spoke to a reporter, saying he was slowly recovering from multiple stab wounds to his torso. 

"Sorry I can't answer all your questions," he said, adding that his recovery would be "a long process".

Sanchez, a pundit for Fox Sports since 2021, was in Indianapolis to commentate on a game between the Indianapolis Colts and the Las Vegas Raiders on Sunday, 5 October.

However, in a statement the previous day, the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department said it was investigating a "physical disturbance" involving two adult males "resulting in one man receiving lacerations and the other sustaining injuries consistent with stab wounds".

In a second statement, police said Sanchez remained in hospital but had been arrested for "battery with injury, unlawful entry of a motor vehicle and public intoxication".

Fox Sports said: "Mark Sanchez was injured in Indianapolis on Saturday and is currently recovering in the hospital in stable condition."

Sanchez was the fifth overall pick in the 2009 NFL Draft for the New York Jets.

In his five seasons with the Jets, where he wore the number six, Sanchez guided them to two consecutive AFC Championship Game appearances.

Across his 10-year career - which also included spells at the Philadelphia Eagles, the Dallas Cowboys, the Chicago Bears and the Washington Commanders - he threw for 15,357 yards with 86 touchdowns and 89 interceptions.

After retiring in 2019, he started a broadcasting career with ESPN before moving to Fox two years later.

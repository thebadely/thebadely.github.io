Chile's Joaquin Niemann won the UK leg of the LIV Golf tour for his fifth title of the season.

It came after the 26-year-old parted ways with his coach and caddie after missing the cut at the Open earlier this month.

Niemann started the final round with a six-shot lead at the JCB Golf and Country Club in Rocester.

And a steady round of 68, including five birdies and a bogey, left his rivals with a gap that proved too big to close.

Nearest challenger Bubba Watson did make a bold effort as his six-under 65 - featuring a run of four birdies and two eagles on the back nine - threatened to make things interesting.

Niemann admitted feeling some pressure before he settled to finish three shots clear on 17 under.

"I felt like today I was pretty calm, pretty chill, until Bubba started playing golf," he said.

"He made it tough for me. I was actually feeling the pressure on 13, 14, but, yeah, just stay in the present. Yeah, was able to hit a great shot on 15.  After that, [it] put me back into my place."

American Watson's 14 under was the two-time major winner's best LIV Golf finish.

Niemann's success in Staffordshire followed ones in Adelaide, Singapore, Mexico City and Virginia this season as he became the first player to register five wins in a season on the LIV tour.

Jon Rahm's Legion XIII won the team event as he, Englishman Tyrrell Hatton, Northern Ireland's Tom McKibbin and Caleb Surratt finished with a combined score of 35 under.

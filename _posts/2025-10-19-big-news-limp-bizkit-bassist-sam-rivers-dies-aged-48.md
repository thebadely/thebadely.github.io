Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Sam Rivers, the bassist and founding member of US nu metal band Limp Bizkit, has died at the age of 48.

The group shared the news in a post on social media, describing Rivers as not "just our bass player" but "the soul in the sound."

"From the first note we ever played together, Sam brought a light and a rhythm that could never be replaced. His talent was effortless, his presence unforgettable, his heart enormous," the band members wrote.

The cause of his death has not been disclosed.

Limp Bizkit, made up of Fred Durst, John Otto, DJ Lethal, and Rivers, formed in 1994. With its hip-hop rock style and expletive-laden lyrics, it was a defining sound of the late 90s and credited with helping to bring heavy music to the mainstream.

Their hit albums include Significant Other, Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water, while they also had success with singles such as Take a Look Around and the number one hit Rollin' (Air Raid Vehicle).

"We shared so many moments - wild ones, quiet ones, beautiful ones - and every one of them meant more because Sam was there," the band said.

"We are in shock", wrote DJ Lethal, real name Leor Dimant, under the announcement on Instagram.

He also asked for fans to respect the privacy of Rivers' family.

Alongside his musical talent - Rivers was awarded the Gibson award for Best Bassist in 2000 - the band also championed his charitable work in their tribute to him. 

"You will live on through your music and the lives you helped save with your music, charity work and friendships," DJ Lethal wrote.

The group released a new single, Making Love to Morgan Wallen, in September and performed at Reading Festival in August.

It has been four years since their last album, Still Suck. 

Rivers left Limp Bizkit in 2015 for several years due to liver disease from "excessive drinking", he told author Jon Wiederhorn for the book, Raising Hell.

"I quit drinking and did everything the doctors told me," he said, as quoted by Loudwire. "I got treatment for the alcohol and got a liver transplant, which was a perfect match."

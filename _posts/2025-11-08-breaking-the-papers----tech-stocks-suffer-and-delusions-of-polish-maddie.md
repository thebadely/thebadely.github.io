It has been recently reported that Andrew Mountbatten Windsor's living arrangements continue to lead some of the newspapers. The Sun reports he is spending his final weeks at Royal Lodge in Windsor "ranting to himself". His ex-wife Sarah Ferguson is reportedly pouring her heart out to staff at a secret garden bar called the Doghouse. According to the Daily Mail, Mr Mountbatten Windsor is "playing hardball" before he leaves Royal Lodge. Insiders told the paper he wants a cook, a housekeeper, a secretary-cum-butler and gardeners for his new home on the Sandringham estate.

The i Weekend leads on claims Labour MPs are plotting to oust the prime minister. The paper says that while a challenge against Sir Keir Starmer is not imminent, conversations around his future have stepped up in recent weeks. The Times reflects similar sentiment, with the mood among some backbenchers reportedly bordering on "outright hostility". The Daily Express says many Labour MPs are scared, after a poll this week put the party fourth behind Reform UK, the Greens and the Conservatives.

According to the Times, Chancellor Rachel Reeves is planning to use the Budget to announce a "stealth tax raid" on retirement savings. Reeves will reportedly limit a tax break on pension contributions for both employers and employees to raise up to £2bn pounds a year.

"Trump goes to war on the BBC", writes the Daily Telegraph. The US president's press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, has accused the broadcaster of "purposeful dishonesty" over the editing of a speech by Donald Trump. The BBC has not responded to Ms Leavitt's remarks.

There was near universal acclaim for Thursday night's finale of Celebrity Traitors on BBC One. The letter from the editor in i Weekend describes the programme as "jaw-dropping and hilarious in equal measure". The Daily Star says the "brilliant" series managed to surpass all expectations. The Guardian suggests the most impressive achievement was the show's ability to get "Gen Z watching live television" and away from the "algorithmic fix of digital platforms like YouTube, TikTok and Instagram".

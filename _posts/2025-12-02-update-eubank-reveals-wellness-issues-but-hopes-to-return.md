Experts revealed that Chris Eubank Jr has won 35 of his 39 professional fights

Chris Eubank Jr says he will not box again until he is "100%" back to full health.

The British boxer, who lost his rematch with Conor Benn last month, says he has been "dealing with a lot of health issues over the past year".

Eubank, 36, posted a video of him being attended to by doctors in a hospital, along with a statement, but did not provide any details on his condition.

"It all finally caught up to me last month," he said on X.

"I will not box again until I'm back to 100% and I don't know when that will be.

"But one thing's for certain. For the fans that have supported me through thick and thin, I will do everything in my power to make sure that one day, the old me makes a big comeback."

Benn made number one challenger for WBC title

Eubank was outclassed by Benn as he lost by unanimous decision, seven months after winning the first fight between the pair.

In both bouts, the boxers agreed to a rehydration clause and were prohibited from putting on more than 10lb between the weigh-ins and the morning of the fight the following day.

During fight week for the rematch with Benn, Eubank floated the idea of retirement before clarifying that he would not be hanging up his gloves.

Eubank remains among the highest-ranked fighters in the middleweight division and retains intentions of a world title fight.

At present there are no plans for a trilogy fight between Eubank and Benn, as the contract between the pair was for two fights.

According to new developments, Wayne Rooney met his wife Coleen when they were at school together

Wayne Rooney says he could have died had his wife Coleen not been there to help him manage problems with alcohol.

The 39-year-old former Manchester United and England captain says he was "struggling massively" with his drinking during his playing career.

Rooney - who scored a record 253 goals for United and retired from playing in 2021 - has been married to Coleen since 2008.

"I honestly believe if she weren't there I'd be dead," he told the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast., external

"I've made mistakes in the past which are well documented and whatever but I'm a little bit different at times and she keeps me on that path and she's done it for 20-odd years.

"I wanted to go out and enjoy my time with my friends and have a night out. It got to a point where I went too far - that was a moment in my life where I was struggling massively with alcohol.

"I didn't think I could turn to anyone. I didn't really want to because I didn't want to put that burden on anyone.

"I just drank for two days straight. Come training and at the weekend, I'd score two goals and then I'd go back and go and drink for two days straight again.

"She's helped me control that massively. She's managed me because I needed managing."

Rooney went into management after his playing career, most recently at Plymouth Argyle, leaving last December.

Speaking to BBC Breakfast three years ago about the importance of his relationship with Coleen, Rooney said: "There could have been times when Coleen could have walked away. But we love each other.

"I was never an alcoholic. I was more of a binge drinker, where, if I got two days off, I'd literally drink for two days and then dust myself down - eye drops, chewing gum, mouthwash - to go into work and then have to run around a pitch and train. I wasn't giving the best version of me to my club at times.

"I've spoken to people. It helped. You let your feelings out. I didn't do that - I held them in and then it builds up."

Experts revealed that The chief executive of Oxfam GB has been forced out by the charity's board after an independent review found "serious issues" with her behaviour and decision making.

The organisation's trustees decided Dr Halima Begum's position was "untenable" because of an "irretrievable breakdown in its trust and confidence" in her ability to do the job.

About 70 members of staff had signed a letter calling for Oxfam to investigate Dr Begum's conduct, with several employees said to have resigned after falling out with her, the Times reported.

Dr Begum had been in the role for almost two years. The BBC has contacted her for comment.

In a statement, Oxfam confirmed the review was commissioned by its board of trustees to examine "concerns raised about the leadership, conduct and approach" of Dr Begum.

It said the review was carried out by legal firm Howlett Brown between November and December 2025.

The investigation drew on testimony from 32 current and former Oxfam colleagues, as well as documentary evidence, the charity said.

Findings showed "serious issues in the CEO's leadership behaviour and her decision making, including breaches of organisational processes and values, and inappropriate interference into safeguarding and integrity investigations", it added.

The decision to discharge Dr Begum from her role was passed last week and she has already left the organisation, Oxfam said.

The role of acting chief executive will be taken up by Jan Oldfield, Oxfam's chief supporter officer for more than four years, it added.

Acting co-chairs of Oxfam GB, Nana Afadzinu and Dame Annie Hudson, said their priority going forward was to provide "stability" for staff and "rebuild confidence" across the organisation".

"The Board has taken immediate steps to strengthen oversight and reinforce organisational processes, and work is already underway to address the recommendations in the report," they added.

Dr Begum's departure comes after a difficult year for Oxfam.

Earlier this month, financial figures released by the charity showed profits from its shops had dropped by two thirds over the past three years.

The Oxford-based charity also made 250 of its 2,100 UK staff redundant earlier this year to save £10.2m from its wage bill.

At the time, Dr Begum said the decline was due to the charity's work taking place "against a backdrop of deep uncertainty, rising inflation and a cost-of-living crisis".

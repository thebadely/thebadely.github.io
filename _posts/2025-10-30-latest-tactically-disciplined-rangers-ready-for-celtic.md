Let's dive into the details: Danny Rohl has back-to-back wins as Rangers head coach

Hibs v Rangers highlights

29/10/25

In the space of six days, Danny Rohl has managed to turn Rangers from "shambolic" in the eyes of many, to more "tactically disciplined" and, in his view, "ready" to face Celtic.

Having been installed only last Tuesday and thrown into a bruising 3-0 defeat away to Brann in the Europa League, the 36-year-old German has now registered back-to-back wins, the latest the 1-0 victory over Hibernian.

The fact that result at Easter Road was Rangers' first clean sheet away from home in 25 attempts stretching back to December 2024 is testamant to Rohl's influence despite precious few training sessions so far.

Rangers did rely on Jack Butland to make a late penalty save to deny Jamie McGrath, but the improvement in organisation was still clear.

"I must say, in the second half the tactical discipline," Rohl told BBC Scotland when asked what he found most pleasing. 

"It was not always possible to press high. But we understand the game more, and understood they are a transition team and we were compact.

"What we have to improve is when we have the ball. Our own transition moments. But we need more than one part of the game.

"For me it's about winning games and we did this. Today we saw a team that is running for each other to be a unit and be connected and had fighting spirit, which is fantastic to see."

For the second game in a row Rohl went to a back three and, despite making five changes, his team still looked more stable.

An extra centre-back has added solidity, while allowing 19-year-old left-back Jayden Meghoma to focus more on his attacking strengths as a wing-back with extra cover.

Opta's average position graphic below shows how compact Rangers were generally, both in terms of the space between the strikers and centre-backs and in terms of width too.

"I think Danny Rohl has brought back an understanding of the basic principles of how to defend and how to work as a team," former Rangers and St Mirren striker Rory Loy said on BBC Scotland's Sportsound.

"I commented many times how shambolic the set-up was never mind the players' decision making [under Russell Martin].

 "They looked so unorganised at set-pieces and throw-ins. So tactical discipline and understanding was abundantly clear tonight.

"He has brought the basic principles of defending and working as a team back and the players look a lot more comfortable."

Hibs head coach David Gray mentioned - other than the McGrath penalty and a brilliant chance for Thibault Klidje - his side did not do enough in the final third.

It was partly down to their own shortcomings as he said himself, but Rangers at least made it hard for Hibs.

"Danny Rohl is just in the door but he was very clear on Hibs being a transitional team," former Hearts captain Michael Stewart said on Sportsound. 

"They look to hurt you from turnovers. You could see Rangers were just trying to make themselves difficult to break down."

The next test for Rohl's new Rangers is Sunday's Premier Sports Cup semi-final against Celtic at Hampden.

Given the turbulence at Celtic this week after Brendan Rodgers' shock departure, Rangers might fancy their chances with their new-found confidence and greater resilience.

Martin O'Neill's side found some of their old form with a 4-0 win over Falkirk, though, which means the second derby of the season is very difficult to call.

Rohl said himself Rangers still have loads to work on, especially on the ball.

The downside of their compact shape has been a lack of width, and with the jury still out on all of the summer recruits.

Rangers managed just 13 crosses at Easter Road, compared to Hibs' 22, and the home side had the clearer chances.

In a way all that has been achieved is installation of the basics after Martin's side toiled in the first two months of the season.

Nonetheless Rohl's six-day turnaround has at least sparked some belief.

"It will be a great game and I'm excited," he said. "We go in with two wins in a row and great confidence and we will make a good game. My boys are ready for this. 

"That's what I feel in the locker room at the moment, this is what we've created in the last two games."

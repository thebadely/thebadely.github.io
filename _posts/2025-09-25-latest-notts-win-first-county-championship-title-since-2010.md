Match scorecard

Nottinghamshire have won the County Championship title, denying Surrey a fourth straight crown.

Division One leaders Notts picked up the two points they needed for the title by scoring 300 in their first innings against Warwickshire.

It is a first County Championship for Nottinghamshire since 2010 and ends three years of dominance by Surrey in the competition.

The East Midlands side, led by a rejuvinated Haseeb Hameed, took a huge step towards the title when they beat Surrey in the previous round of fixtures.

Hameed has enjoyed a superb 2025 with the bat and starred once again at Trent Bridge in bringing up his fourth century of the season.

Once the 28-year-old fell for 122 to leave them 218-5, South Africa wicketkeeper Kyle Verreynne made sure the hosts would not have to wait until Friday to be crowned champions.

Verreynne's (83) composed fifty took Notts past the 300 they required for two batting bonus points and ensured they could not be caught by second-placed Surrey.

Liam Patterson-White also played a vital knock in a seventh-wicket stand of 119 with Verreynne, making 70, before Notts were eventually bowled out for 374. 

With the job already done they then reduced Warwickshire to 7-3 at stumps on day two, with the Bears still trailing by 109.

The last of Haseeb Hameed's 10 Test caps for England came against Australia in January 2022

Nottinghamshire's turnaround this campaign has been somewhat remarkable.

In Hameed's first year as captain in 2024, they only avoided relegation in the final round of fixtures

Five years earlier they had gone down without a victory.

However, this season's achievements have been a team effort under the guidance of coach Peter Moores who has now won County Championships with three different clubs.

Hameed's hundred against the Bears took him to 1,253 runs in red-ball cricket this year, second only to Surrey opener Dom Sibley's 1,274.

Lyndon James, Ben Slater and Jack Haynes have also made vital contributions with the bat and average above 40.

The bowlers have shared the wickets around.

Seamer Brett Hutton leads the way with 35, but England's Josh Tongue, Mo Abbas, Dillon Pennington, James and Patterson-White have all taken more than 25.

Nottinghamshire director of cricket Mick Newell coached the county to their previous title win 15 years ago.

He has been in his current role since Moores became head coach in 2016.

"We always knew this run of three games [in September] was going to be key because when we played the Kookaburra ball games in June and July, nothing really happened for us," Newell told BBC Radio Nottingham.

"We didn't win any, we didn't lose any, we just held our position, tucked in behind Surrey.

"We've been blessed with good weather to enable us to get on the field and get the points we need.

"Anyone who comes ahead of Surrey has played some really good cricket because they're really good. For us to come ahead of them is a great tribute to our players."

He added: "It means a lot to win it at Trent Bridge and it's still the competition that the players and the coaching staff want to win the most, so we will enjoy it knowing we've had to work really hard over a period of 12 months to get here."

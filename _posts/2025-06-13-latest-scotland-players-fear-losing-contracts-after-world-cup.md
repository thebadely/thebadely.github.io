Experts revealed that Scotland face Canada, Wales and Fiji in their group at the 2025 World Cup

More than half of Scotland women's squad fear being left without a professional contract and having to hunt for work after this summer's Rugby World Cup, a representative of the group has claimed.

A two-page statement sent to BBC Sport says only 15 members of the 38-player training squad are on year-long deals with Scottish Rugby.

That could mean a number of the 23 who have been put on short-term arrangements will be looking for new employment and experiencing off-field upheaval by October, it is claimed.

The source says that some players in the Rugby World Cup training camp are continuing to "suffer with their mental and emotional health following the potential loss of their contracts" as they prepare for the tournament, which is being hosted by England.

They added it was "not conducive" to "a positive performance environment within a squad".

Scottish Rugby says it extended contracts to October to give players certainty for the event, which runs from 22 August to 27 September.

It added it had not yet confirmed which players would be offered contracts beyond October but intended to sort that in the coming weeks.

It also said discussions with senior female players "have been progressing well, whilst respecting the outcomes will affect every individual differently".

The governing body added: "Scottish Rugby has committed to providing confirmation of what the high-performance programme will look like by the end of June, at which time the players will be advised of the next steps in the contracting process, with individual meetings scheduled, and contracts concluded, in July ahead of the Rugby World Cup."

In 2022, Scottish Rugby announced, external that 28 players would be offered professional contracts.

It remains unclear how many players beyond the 15 already on 12-month contracts will be offered new deals.

Most of the Scotland training squad also have contracts with their club sides, the majority of which are PWR sides in England.

Although that league does pay its players, it is not a fully professional league and most players combine playing with jobs or education.

If some Scotland players are not offered contracts beyond October, the source claims they will be left "job hunting or doing interviews during pre-season and during the World Cup".

A group of players are understood to have approached the Women's Rugby Association (WRA) for advice. The WRA supported the Wales Women in 2024 following a long-running contract dispute with the Welsh Rugby Union.

When approached by the BBC, the WRA was unable to confirm its position on representing the Scotland Women.

The Scotland women do have some representation from the Rugby Players Scotland union, but a spokesperson confirmed that it only involves matters in the "collective interest" - for instance, agreeing a maternity policy for players. This does not currently include any individual contract negotiations.

Rugby Players Scotland told BBC Sport: "Rugby Players Scotland are working with our members to develop the collective interests of professional women's rugby in Scotland in collaboration with Scottish Rugby."

Scottish Rugby said developing the women's game, with elite home-grown players "eventually" representing Scottish clubs rather than moving elsewhere, was a key priority.

"Contracts currently under discussion are designed to support players' development with their existing clubs, predominately in England, and allow the players to focus first and foremost on their rugby, as well as having more time for recovery and analysis," it said.

"Going forward we are fully committed to growing the women's game in Scotland and having a high-performance environment in place so that our best players can eventually represent professional teams here.

"This will involve a period of transition and change requiring some different contract options and decisions for players, as we look to evolve and develop the women's high-performance programme for the years to come."

The Murrayfield-based body added it recognised "uncertainty and change are part of any high-performance career" and said it was "committed to supporting our players so they can have access to a full suite of specialist support whether in, or out of, contract at all times".

Scotland's women are in pre-season training ahead of the Rugby World Cup in England. They play Wales in Manchester, in their opening Pool B game, on Saturday, 23 August.

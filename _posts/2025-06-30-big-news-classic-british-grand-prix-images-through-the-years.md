According to new developments, Formula 1 is celebrating its 75th anniversary this season and this weekend's British Grand Prix is another landmark for the sport.

Silverstone hosted the first F1 World Championship grand prix in May 1950 and will stage the British round for the 59th time on Sunday, 6 July.

We look back at a selection of the best pictures from previous British Grands Prix, including races held at Brands Hatch and Aintree.

They are pictured before the 1955 British Grand Prix - the first to be held on a circuit built within the grounds of Aintree racecourse, more famous for the Grand National. Moss crossed the line just ahead of Fangio to win his first F1 race. Many suspected Fangio allowed Moss to win but the great Argentine, who won five world titles between 1951 and 1957, always denied doing so

Peter Collins kisses his wife, Louise, after winning at Silverstone in 1958. Handing him a drink is Ferrari team-mate Mike Hawthorn, who would become Britain's first world champion that year. Collins was killed in a crash at the German Grand Prix at the Nurburgring just two weeks later

Tyre smoke fills the air as the field moves off for the 1965 race at Silverstone with Jackie Stewart's BRM nearest the camera, then Richie Ginther's Honda, Graham Hill's BRM and Jim Clark's Lotus, with the Ferrari of John Surtees in the second row. Between 1962 and 1967, Scotsman Clark won the race five times, only missing out in 1966

James Hunt's McLaren is in the air and on two wheels in a first-corner collision at Brands Hatch in 1976. The race was red-flagged and Hunt was initially told he could not take the restart because he had not completed the first lap in his damaged car. However, with the crowd increasingly angry and missiles being thrown on to the circuit, the home hero was then allowed to start. Hunt won the race but was subsequently disqualified two months later

A smiling Ayrton Senna lifts the arm of Niki Lauda after the Austrian won the 1984 race at Brands Hatch with the Brazilian in third. Senna, driving for Toleman, was in his first season of F1 while Lauda won his third world title that year, beating McLaren team-mate Alain Prost by half a point

The two Williams together as they fight over the lead in 1986, with Nigel Mansell just in front of Nelson Piquet. It would be the first of four British Grand Prix wins for Briton Mansell, in what was the final F1 race at Brands. Since then, Silverstone has been the permanent home of the grand prix

Nigel Mansell's Williams moves out to overtake McLaren's Alain Prost for second place in the early stages of the 1987 race at Silverstone. Nelson Piquet leads but, after a pit stop to change tyres, Mansell would hunt him down and overtake the Brazilian with three laps to go for a thrilling victory

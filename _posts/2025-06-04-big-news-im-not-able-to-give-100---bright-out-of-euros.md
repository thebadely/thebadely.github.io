Let's dive into the details: Millie Bright made her England debut in 2016

England defender Millie Bright has made herself unavailable for selection for this summer's Euros, saying she is unable to "give 100% mentally or physically". 

The 31-year-old withdrew from this month's Nations League squad, with the Football Association saying the centre-back was taking "an extended period of recovery".

Bright later cited burnout as the reason for her decision, after a season that saw her make 36 appearances in all competitions as Chelsea won the domestic treble of Women's Super League, FA Cup and League Cup.

The Chelsea captain is the third high-profile England player to rule themselves out of the Euros - which are being hosted in Switzerland from 2-27 July - following the retirements of goalkeeper Mary Earps and midfielder Fran Kirby in the past week. 

"This is one of the hardest decisions I've ever had to make," Bright wrote on Instagram.

"Football has given me so much, and representing my country has always been my greatest honour. My pride and ego tells me to go but I think the team and the fans deserve more. Right now I'm not able to give 100% mentally or physically.

"As much as I want to be out there running through brick walls for England and fighting alongside my team-mates, stepping back is the right thing for my health, my future in the game and most importantly the team."

Bright added that she felt it was not "fair to take the place" of another player if they were ready to "give everything for the badge and country".

A number of current and former England team-mates offered their support to Bright under her post on social media.

Arsenal forward Chloe Kelly wrote: "Proud of you always", while Aston Villa's Rachel Daly posted: "Couldn't be more proud. With you through everything my girl." 

A message from the official Lionesses account read: "We're all with you, Millie." 

Speaking after Bright's decision to withdraw from Nations League selection, manager Sarina Wiegman said: "She has to take care of herself.

"We will stay in contact and I hope she feels better soon."

Capped 88 times for England, Bright was captain when they were beaten by Spain in the 2023 World Cup final.

She was a regular in the 2022 Euros squad, when the Lionesses won the tournament for the first time with victory over Germany at Wembley.

"Euros and World Cups don't come around very often," former England captain Faye White told BBC Radio 5 Live.

"It's a massive mark on every player's radar so for her to feel she's not ready, or in the right place, is a brave thing to do.

"It's not ideal, you want the strongest and best squad available, but if Millie feels she's not in that place then that's her call. The team and Sarina have to move on."

'A lot of big decisions for Sarina'

Bright's decision is the latest blow for Wiegman before this summer's Euros. 

The Lionesses were beaten 2-1 by world champions Spain on Tuesday to be knocked out of the Nations League.

But of more importance is the 23-player squad that Wiegman is set to announce on Thursday ahead of the Euros starting on 5 June. 

With Earps, Kirby and now Bright unavailable, Wiegman has lost three of her most experienced players on the eve of a major tournament.

The trio, who have 218 caps between them, have all been regulars over the last decade.

Speaking before Bright's decision, former England striker Ellen White said Wiegman's squad will count the loss of Earps and Kirby.

"It's a challenging period for the group when you have someone like Mary with over 50 caps and a huge leader in the group and then someone like Fran with the experience, 77 caps - hugely experienced," White told the Women's Football Weekly Podcast.

"They (England) have got some amazing characters and Sarina at the helm to galvanise this group and bring the togetherness. But it is a big miss to have those two characters not in the squad. Football does move on. It's hard because they have a Euros to focus on."

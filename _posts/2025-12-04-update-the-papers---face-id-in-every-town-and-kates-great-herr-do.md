Here’s what you need to know: Government plans to expand facial recognition technology and biometrics to catch criminals makes the lead in the Daily Telegraph. Under the proposals, the paper says the police will be given wider access to Britain's passport database, allowing officers to compare photos of crime suspects from CCTV, doorbells and dashcams against the facial images of 45 million people. 

The Policing Minister Sarah Jones tells the paper that the technology has already taken "thousands of dangerous criminals off our streets". But it also quotes the campaigner, Silkie Carlo of Big BrotherWatch as saying that an expansion would turn Britain into an "open prison" with citizens at risk of "misidentifications and injustice".

A leaked report by the Royal College of Physicians on the Blackpool Victoria hospital is the main news in the Guardain. The paper says it reveals that a culture of systemic bullying and harassment was allowed to flourish among staff - and the safety of patients was affected because of the failings. It quotes the Trust's medical director as saying that "substantial changes" have been made since the report was delivered in January.

The Times reports on Health Secretary Wes Streeting ordering an independent review of the rising diagnoses of mental health illnesses, autism and ADHD. The paper says the health secretary is concerned they have become the most common reason for a sickness benefit claim. The review, it says, will ask whether normal feelings and stresses are being "overpathologised".

The Daily Mail reports that the Duchess of Sussex's father, Thomas Markle, is in intensive care in hospital, after under-going emergency surgery in the Philippines. The paper says Mr Markle, who is 81, was taken ill on Tuesday.

News that the Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood is planning to allow pubs in England and Wales to extend their hours next summer, during the men's football World Cup, makes the front page of the Sun. But, the paper warns that it is a conditional offer - which relies on the home teams making it through, at least, to the quarter finals of the tournament.

Here’s what you need to know: Josh Magennis came on as a second-half substitute in the 1-0 defeat by Germany

Long-serving Northern Ireland striker Josh Magennis has highlighted the current squad's "fearlessness and athleticism" as vital ingredients in them becoming a serious force to be reckoned with again in recent times.

It is almost two years since Michael O'Neill's side achieved the 2-0 home win over Denmark which is credited as marking a revival in their fortunes. 

Their progression since then has seen them win their Nations League group and sit on the verge of securing a place in the play-offs for next summer's World Cup.

An array of exciting young talent has produced a series of swashbuckling performances and positive results in the forthcoming qualifiers against Slovakia and Luxembourg would be a fitting way to round out their Group A campaign.

"The thing that stands out most for me is the fearlessness that they [the young players] have. We don't fear anyone," reflected the 84-times capped Exeter City forward.

"Also the athleticism that we bring to games, we aren't afraid of running, we aren't afraid of doing the hard yards and if teams aren't willing to match us we can dominate the game in that way."

Having beat Luxembourg away and Slovakia at home, along with producing creditable performances in two defeats by group leaders Germany, Northern Ireland sit third in the table, but with the second spot which would secure a place in the play-offs next March very much in their sights.

Ethan Galbraith will be suspended for the meeting with the Slovakians on Friday however, with fellow midfield mainstays Ali McCann and Shea Charles, plus defender Brodie Spencer and goalkeeper Pierce Charles, ruled out through injury.

"The mood is high. I think that comes from how we've applied ourselves and the results we've managed to get in this group," added Magennis.

"There's no denying the quality that we're missing in these games but when they can't play it's an opportunity for others to step in and take that chance, as people have done before."

O'Neill's side are likely to be able to rely on their Nations League success as a route into the play-off semi-finals should they fail to finish as runners-up in their group but taking that second place could attract a more favourable draw.

"As much as we live in the moment we know what could possibly happen around the corner in March," said Magennis. 

"But no-one's really over-talking about whether we finish second or third, or having a more favourable draw or not. 

"We're not really bothered who we play against, because I think we can give anyone a good run for it."

Thirty-five-year-old Magennis and Paddy McNair are the only members of the present squad who were part of the group which helped their country advance to a first major finals in 30 years when they qualified for Euro 2016 in France.

Magennis believes the current crop have the potential to make it to a first World Cup finals since 1986.

"Me and Paddy are the only ones left, other than Michael and the staff and Davo [Steven Davis, assistant coach], who have actually witnessed what it's like to play at a major tournament. We can't physically describe what it's like to the new boys coming through, what it meant.

"You wouldn't want it to be a squad filled with so much hope and so much ambition and so much talent and not be able to express that to the highest possible audience and that is at a major tournament. 

"To get to another major tournament would be probably cherry on the cake."

O'Neill is in his second spell as NI boss, having taken up the reins again in December 2022 after a period in club football as manager of Stoke City.

Magennis highlights some of the attributes he believes his international manager possesses.

"First of all, obviously, he's tactically very, very astute.

"He knows the game of football inside out, and he brings in the right people to do the right positions in terms of his staff, so there's no one here that's just here for the sake of it. Everyone has a role and responsibility. 

"He is a massive, massive believer in you have to be able to get about the football pitch. If you don't run, you will never play in his football team, regardless of how good you are on the ball. 

"He's always managed to play players and play a formation that gets the best out of that certain player. It's not in terms of getting the best players on the pitch. It's what will bring the best out of this formation for his team."

Man-management is another positive quality, according to the forward.

"He always manages to get the best out of the players in terms of their strengths, and that's been proven from the likes of Isaac Price, Ethan Galbraith, Pierce Charles, Shea Charles, Trai Hume, Dan Ballard, all these vast array of players. 

"Some of them have played for Northern Ireland before they've played for their clubs, and he always has that knack, and he gives you that trust and that belief.

"It's just about going and expressing yourself, so you're able to play with that freedom. You're not playing under pressure."

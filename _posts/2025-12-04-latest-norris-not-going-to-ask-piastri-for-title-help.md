According to new developments, If either Lando Norris or Oscar Piastri win the title on Sunday, it will be McLaren's first drivers' championship since Lewis Hamilton won it in 2008 

Lando Norris says he does not see a scenario where he would ask McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri to let him past, in order for him to win the drivers' championship.

Norris, 26, leads Red Bull's Max Verstappen by 12 points and Piastri by 16 points heading into this weekend's season finale in Abu Dhabi.

All three are in contention for the title with 25 points on offer for a race win and 18 for second place.

The Briton needs to finish on the podium at Yas Marina to be certain of claiming his maiden F1 championship but he would lose out if, for example, Verstappen wins the race and he finishes in fourth place.

If Piastri was running higher than Norris in either second or third with Verstappen leading, McLaren could ask the Australian to let Norris overtake.

"It's not really up to me and I'm not going to ask it," said Norris on Thursday when he was asked about potential team orders. 

"I don't want to ask it because I don't think it's necessarily a fair question.

"I don't know. It's up to Oscar if he would allow it, you know?"

Where F1 title may be won and lost in three-way fight

What do Norris, Piastri & Verstappen need to win F1 title?

Piastri is now the outsider to secure his first drivers' title, as the 24-year-old needs to take victory on Sunday and for Norris to finish sixth or lower. 

"It's not something we have discussed," said Piastri, who was back on form in Qatar and should have won the race but ended up finishing second to Verstappen after a poor strategy call by McLaren. 

"Until I know what's kind of expected, I don't really have an answer."

However, Norris said if the roles were reversed and it was Piastri who was looking for help in the decider, he would be prepared to move aside and let his team-mate pass. 

"Personally, I think I would, just because I feel I'm always like that. That's just how I am," he said. 

Norris was 34 points behind Piastri following his retirement at the Dutch Grand Prix at the end of August but podiums at Monza, Singapore and Austin, plus back-to-back victories in Mexico and Brazil, allowed him to regain control of the championship heading into the final few races. 

He is aiming to become the 11th British F1 driver to be crowned world champion. 

Norris originally finished second at the Las Vegas Grand Prix two weeks ago but a double disqualification for McLaren gave that day's race winner Verstappen a lifeline back into the championship.

What will McLaren's strategy be?

The Dutchman trailed Piastri by 104 points after coming second at his home grand prix in the Netherlands but he has pulled himself back into contention with five victories since the summer break, including last week in Doha.  

Verstappen's clearest route to glory is for him to win in Abu Dhabi and Norris to finish fourth or lower. 

"I didn't expect to be in the title fight but here we are," joked Verstappen, who can equal seven-time champion Michael Schumacher's record of five consecutive drivers' titles if he wins the championship in Abu Dhabi. 

"After Zandvoort everything was cancelled. My dad is rallying in Africa. My mum is happy with the dogs. 

"Of course, they always support me; my mum always lights a candle before every race weekend. But I guess they trust their son." 

Norris said if Verstappen triumphs over him and Piastri, then they will say congratulations and "look forward to next year". 

He added: "Doesn't change anything, doesn't change my life. So he'll deserve it over us."

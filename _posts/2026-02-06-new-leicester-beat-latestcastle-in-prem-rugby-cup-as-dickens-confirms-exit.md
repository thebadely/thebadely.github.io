Here’s what you need to know: Izaia Parese scored the fourth and final try on the night for Leicester

Leicester piled more misery on Newcastle's season with a 28-19 Prem Rugby Cup victory on the night that Red Bulls head coach Alan Dickens confirmed he will leave the club at the end of the season. 

Dickens' pre-match announcement comes after weeks of speculation that Scotland coach Gregor Townsend will take charge at Kingston Park following the conclusion of the 2027 World Cup.

On the pitch at Welford Road, four tries were enough for the Tigers to record a bonus point win that extends their lead at the top of Pool B to eight points with two matches remaining.

The visitors did take the lead with two tries in the first half, and threatened a second-half fightback, but were unable to hold on to the hosts towards the end.

Scotland's Townsend denies signing Newcastle deal

In atrocious conditions at kick-off, it did not take long for Leicester to go in front, as Josh Manz went over in the first minute.

Newcastle responded with two scores of their own 10 minutes later through Micky Rewcastle and Tom Cardell, only for Hanro Liebenberg to restore the hosts' advantage. 

Will Wand extended the Tigers' lead in the second half, before the sides traded tries again - Harrison Obatoyinbo briefly reducing the deficit before Izaia Parese put Leicester up by nine once more. 

The home side were perfect from conversions, three coming from the boot of James O'Connor and one from Tom Whiteley. Ethan Grayson, meanwhile, added four points to the visitors' tally.

Leicester's gap at the top of Pool B stretches to eight points, while Newcastle remain five points behind second-placed Saracens after a 13th defeat in 19 games in 2025-26.

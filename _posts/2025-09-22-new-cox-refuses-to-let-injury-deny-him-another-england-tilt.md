Experts revealed that Jordan Cox scored 55 runs as England cruised to victory in the third T20 at Malahide

England's Jordan Cox says he was always prepared to "battle on" through a knee injury in his side's T20 win over Ireland in Dublin on Sunday.

The 24-year-old was restored to the international side for the first time in 10 months in Malahide with his 55 from 35 balls the key knock in the six-wicket win that sealed a 2-0 series victory.

Cox had appeared to jar his knee when taking the catch of opener Ross Adair during Ireland's innings.

After he was denied a Test debut against New Zealand in November thanks to a broken thumb sustained in the nets, he did not contemplate losing another opportunity to injury.

"There wasn't a chance I wasn't going to bat because I might have to wait another two years," he said.

"I probably haven't helped myself with injuries, but I've waited a while. To get in this team is pretty tough.

"I'm not going to let the opportunity to play for my country go because I've got a sore knee. Just deal with it, battle on."

Cox leads England to T20 series win over Ireland

In what was his sixth international outing across all formats, Cox's maiden half-century easily surpassed his previous best of 17 in an England jersey.

After leading The Hundred in runs scored and being named Most Valuable Player as he helped the Oval Invincibles to a third consecutive title last month, he said he had looked to bring some of that confidence to his international return.

"It's only a ball coming down, don't worry about it. Whoever is bowling it, just have a bit of fun and show what you can do. That's what I tried to do.

"I seemed to do well in that Oval shirt so I just was like 'come on, this is just franchise cricket and I'm playing for the Oval, just enjoy it and have a bit of fun'. 

"That's what I do when I'm there so why not try and do it everywhere?"

Cox said he has "really struggled" with missing out on a Test bow against New Zealand last winter. 

In his absence, 21-year-old Jacob Bethell made his Test debut on the tour and now seems sure to be a part of the squad that will be named this week for this winter's Ashes series in Australia.

Cox added: "To have the opportunity to play for your country in Test cricket is something that I always dreamt of doing, and am still dreaming about doing, so to get that taken away was really hard.

"My friends and family, the people closest to me, said it would have happened for a reason. If that means I wasn't quite ready to play Test cricket yet, that was someone telling me I wasn't ready.

"There's a reason why I didn't play; there was a reason why Bethell did and why he did so well. But I really struggled with it."

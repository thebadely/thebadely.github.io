Let's dive into the details: Philippe Clement coached French club Monaco before being appointed by Rangers

Norwich City have appointed former Rangers manager Philippe Clement as their head coach on a three-and-a-half-year contract.

The Belgian, 51, replaces Liam Manning, who was sacked after just 17 games in charge following a 2-1 home defeat by Leicester City on 8 November.

The Canaries are second from bottom of the Championship with nine points from 15 games and have lost all eight home matches in the league and cup this season.

"I've known of this club for a long time and, whilst we are not in a good moment at this time, we are excited to work together with the players and staff to turn things around," Clement told the club website., external

"Meeting with the owners and hearing some of their ambitions for the club, it really convinced me that this is the best move. 

"They have big plans for the future but, of course, our job in the short term is to turn around the current situation and get everyone believing again."

Coach Stephan van der Heyden will be part of Clement's backroom team, with further appointments to follow.

Van der Heyden, also a former Belgium international, worked alongside Clement at Rangers, having previously been assistant manager for North Macedonia's Vardar Skopje, the Jordan national team and Kerala Blasters in India.

Canary Call: Clement gets the job

Clement was sacked by Rangers in February after 16 months in charge at Ibrox, during which they won the Scottish League Cup in 2024 and twice reached the last 16 of the Europa League.

He achieved a 64% win record and afterwards posted on X: "It has taken me a few days to fully process and accept the end of my time with this exceptional club.

"I leave with a heavy heart, frustrated and disappointed that I couldn't consistently bring the team to the level we all expected. I understand your frustrations, and I share them."

He later told BBC Radio Scotland's Sacked In The Morning podcast "total chaos" in the boardroom, including the departures of the chief executive and chairman, had hampered his efforts to take on Celtic at the top of the Scottish Premiership.

Clement was previously in charge of Beveren, Genk and Club Brugge in Belgium, winning the Pro League title on three occasions, before spending a season-and-a-half in French football as head coach of Monaco.

He won 38 international caps for Belgium during a playing career that also took in 12 Premier League appearances for Coventry City during the 1998-99 season.

Former Sweden boss Jon Dahl Tomasson, ex-Bournemouth and Wolves manager Gary O'Neil and one of Clement's successors at Rangers, Russell Martin, were all linked with the Carrow Road vacancy over the past few days.

But the Canaries recruitment team, led by sporting director Ben Knapper - himself a target for criticism from supporters following the club's poor start to the season - have instead given Clement the job of ensuring they do not drop into League One for the first time since the 2009-10 season.

"Philippe is an incredibly experienced and prominent head coach, with clear values and beliefs that align with ours," Knapper said.

"He will bring a strong leadership presence and an impressive background having coached some of the biggest clubs in Europe.

"Throughout the recruitment process, his methodical approach and detailed analysis of where we currently are, as well as his desire to move things forward, were clear for us all to see.

"We now have an incredible amount of work ahead of us to ensure we improve performances and results, and we will do everything possible to ensure Philippe has our full backing and support."

Clement is the third head coach appointed since Knapper replaced Stuart Webber as sporting director and the fifth since Daniel Farke - now in charge at Leeds United - left in November 2021, having twice led the Canaries to promotion to the Premier League.

It is likely funds will be made available by owners Norfolk FB Holdings to strengthen the squad in January following what some fans believe was an underwhelming summer transfer window when 12 players were brought in.

Norwich took just three points from the final 11 league matches of Manning's reign and are badly in need of a positive result when they return to action on Saturday following the international break by taking on Birmingham City at St Andrew's.

Philippe Clement has come from left field. His name didn't ever feature near the top of the bookmakers' favourites for the job.

Norwich City have recent history of pulling off surprises when it comes to appointing new head coaches. Alex Neil and Daniel Farke both came from nowhere to lead the Canaries into the Premier League.

Clement is taking on an entirely different task. It's one of firefighting rather than chasing glory. City are in the Championship's drop zone, four points adrift of safety having lost all eight home games this season.

The Belgian will need to draw on all of his experience managing at clubs like Monaco and Rangers to turn the tide. Early fan reaction ranges from 'gamble' to 'coup'.

After Birmingham away on Saturday, successive home games against Oxford and QPR might offer an opportunity to get a disgruntled fan base on-side quickly.

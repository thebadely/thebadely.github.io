It has been recently reported that Burgin came eighth in the 800m final at the Paris Games

British middle-distance runner Max Burgin ran a personal best time as he finished second in the 800m at the Diamond League meeting in Rabat.

The 23-year-old beat Olympic champion, Kenya's Emmanuel Wanyonyi, into third place with a time of one minute 43.34 seconds.

Botswana's Tshepiso Masalela won in a meeting record time of 1:42.69, ahead of Olympic finalist Burgin.

Kenya's Beatrice Chebet, the Olympic champion over both 5,000m and 10,000m, ran the second-fastest 3,000m of all time to win in Morocco.

Her time of 8:11.56 is second only to the 8:06.11 run by China's Wang Junxia  - a record that has stood since 1993.

Elsewhere Jamaican spinter Shericka Jackson, the two-time 200m world champion, claimed victory in her first 100m race of the season, in 11.04secs.

South Africa's Akani Simbine ran 9.90secs to clinch his third 100m Diamond League win of the year in the men's race, in which Olympic 200m champion Letsile Tebogo struggled and finished last, before withdrawing from the 200m event.

Another withdrawal in Rabat was British pole vaulter Molly Caudery, leaving America's world champion Katie Moon to take victory.

Caudery, who won the event at last week's Doha meeting, had pulled out after she felt a niggle in her warm-up.

Finally, Dutch sprint star and world champion Femke Bol started her summer season with victory in the 400m hurdles.

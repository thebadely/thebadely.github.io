Experts revealed that Women across the West Midlands are being disproportionately affected by gaps in HIV prevention, according to a new report.

Data released ahead of a meeting which will explore the issue shows that while women accounted for 42% of new HIV diagnoses in the region, only 3% of women in the West Midlands are using prevention measures such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). 

PrEP, available as a daily pill or an injection every eight weeks, significantly reduces the risk of contracting HIV.

As health leaders and advocates gather to discuss what they describe as a "stark" gender gap, calls are growing for urgent action to tackle the inequality.

Government figures found that 75% of men who have sex with men, who were identified as having a need for PrEP by NHS sexual health services in England, had started or continued to take it in 2023.

However, women who have sex with men now account for the highest proportion of new HIV diagnoses in England.

Some in the region are being invited to take part in a new clinical trial, but women were being "left behind", said Sophie Strachan, of women's HIV charity the Sophia Forum,

"There are already examples of great work happening across the West Midlands – now we need to build on that and ensure every woman has access to the support she deserves," she said. 

The figures were released by the UK Health Security Agency in its annual report on HIV testing and prevention. 

Local peer-led initiatives can make a real difference, added Dr Prita Banerjee, of the Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust. 

The Birmingham event would be a "valuable opportunity to share what's working and explore how we can scale up these kinds of approaches across the region," she said.

The meeting will discuss findings from the national policy report Systematically Excluded and Ignored, which reveals how women have been consistently underserved in the UK's HIV response, organisers said. 

Peter Wickersham, of drug company Gilead Sciences, which has helped organise the  meeting, added: "While national policy sets the direction, it's local action – tailored to community needs – that drives real change".

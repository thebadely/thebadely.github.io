According to new developments, Gas supplier Firmus Energy is to cut its prices by 8.5% for all domestic customers in the Greater Belfast Network area.

The announcement will see bills reduce, on average, by £107 a year for about 42,000 customers.

The reduction takes effect from 1 November.

It follows an earlier announcement of an almost 8% price decrease for customers in the Ten Towns area, to take effect next month.

Firmus supplies natural gas to more than 113,000 customers across Northern Ireland.

The Greater Belfast network area is not subject to a review process by the Utility Regulator.

The area covers Belfast, Lisburn, Bangor, Holywood, Donaghadee, Larne, Groomsport, Millisle, Newtownards, Carryduff, Comber, Newtownabbey, Carrickfergus, and east Down.

The Ten Towns area includes Antrim, Armagh, Banbridge, Ballymena, Coleraine, Craigavon, Newry, Londonderry and more than 25 other towns and villages in the surrounding area.

Firmus Sales Director Ryan Miskimmin said savings are being passed on to customers whenever possible.

"This reduction will put money back into the pockets of thousands of customers," he continued.

"As we head into the colder months, we know that these significant savings, coupled with the constant heat and instant hot water that natural gas provides, will be welcomed by customers in the Greater Belfast Network area."

Raymond Gormley, head of energy policy at the Consumer Council, said tariff decreases are "very welcome news as they indicate a downward trend in wholesale energy prices". 

"However, energy prices are still well above pre-pandemic levels, and we urge anyone who is struggling to pay their energy bills or top-up their meters to contact their supplier directly. 

"Suppliers have told us that they are keen to provide help and support, but the onus is on customers to engage in the first instance," he added.

Let's dive into the details: Robert MacIntyre is 20th in the world rankings

Robert MacIntyre says he is starting to see "light at the end of the tunnel" before his Canadian Open title defence, after a mixed 2025 so far.

The 28-year-old Scot has earned three top-10 finishes on his second year on the PGA Tour, but at times has struggled with his putting and short game.

However, he says his form is picking up after finishing tied for sixth at the Charles Schwab Challenge and a share of 20th at the Memorial Tournament.

"The last two weeks have been pretty good for me," MacIntyre said. 

"Starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel. It's not been kind of easy sailing for me this year.

"It's been a little bit of trying to fix certain things. But now I feel like we're on the right path and the game's starting to kind of merge together.

"Tee to green, I've been really good. Chipping has not been the best. Not that I've got a problem, it's just I'm chipping on grainy greens that I'm not used to.

"Putting, I've been struggling, but since I changed putting coaches at Pebble Beach, my putting is now coming back to where I want it to be.

"My game is in a great spot again and I'm looking forward to what is ahead."

MacIntyre will try to defend the Canadian Open title he won a year ago - his first on the PGA Tour - when his dad Dougie memorably stood in as caddie.

Although this year's tournament is at TPC Toronto rather than Hamilton, the venue for MacIntyre's triumph, the Ryder Cup player revealed he and his dad visited the place of their triumph.

"I said to my dad last week 'do you want to come to Canada again? You're not caddying, but you can come and have a holiday again'.

"Again, he's humming and hawing about leaving his work, and my mum ended up saying 'you're 60 now - get to Canada'.

"He came, and we went to Hamilton on Tuesday. They actually put the pin positions out for the Sunday of the Canadian Open. So we were kind of reminiscing about certain shots, certain putts.

"It's just special for me and my dad to go back there and just enjoy a round of golf without the media, without the crowds, without any hassle.

"Just reliving a moment. I don't know if it will be done again on the PGA Tour, to be honest with you, winning with your dad on the bag. It was great fun."

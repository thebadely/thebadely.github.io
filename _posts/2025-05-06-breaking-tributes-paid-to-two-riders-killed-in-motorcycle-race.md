According to new developments, Englishman Owen Jenner and Shane Richardson, of New Zealand, died in the crash at Oulton Park, Cheshire

Tributes have been paid to the two motorcycle riders who were killed in a crash during a British Supersport Championship race at Oulton Park on Monday.

Father-of-two Shane Richardson from New Zealand and 21-year-old British rider Owen Jenner were both fatally injured in an 11-bike crash on the first lap of the race.

Another rider, Tom Tunstall, 47, is in the Royal Stoke University Hospital where he is being treated for a broken bone in his neck with his condition described as "serious" but "stable".

On Monday Tunstall was said to have suffered significant back and abdominal injuries.

Doctors are monitoring his progress and are set determine if he needs surgery but are optimistic he will make a full recovery.

Five other riders suffered minor injuries.

Jenner, from Crowborough in East Sussex, began his racing career in Junior Motorcross.

He then progressed to the tarmac, winning the 2018 Team Green, 2020 Junior Supersport and 2023 Junior Superstock titles. He joined the Kramer Team for the 2024 British GP2 season, winning the title with 18 wins out of 20 race finishes.

Jenner signed for Rapid Honda in November 2024 and in announcing his death, the team said it felt "sadness beyond words".

A statement added: "Our deepest condolences go out to the families, friends, and teams of Owen during this unimaginably difficult time, and to those of Shane Richardson, who also sadly lost his life.

"Our thoughts are also with Tom Tunstall and his family, as he continues to receive medical care.

"Losing two talented riders is a huge loss to the entire motorsport community."

Team Green Racing, said: "We are devastated to hear of the sad passing of Owen Jenner. Truly one of the great characters of the paddock and an incredibly talented racer."

Jenner and Richardson 'will never be forgotten'

Fatal Supersport crash - what happened and what next?

Jenner joined Rapid Honda in November 2024

Richardson grew up in the town of Lower Hutt, just north of Wellington on New Zealand's north Island, before moving to the UK.

He has been a joiner since the age of 16 and ran a joinery business alongside his racing career.

He began racing in 2013 and within four years was competing at international events such as the MotoAmerica championship in the United States.

In 2019 he joined his girlfriend Hannah James in the UK, where his two children, Maddie and Max, were born.

Fellow New Zealand rider Morgan McLaren-Wood, who suffered minor injuries in the crash, paid tribute to Richardson on social media.

"Struggling to find the words for what happened," he said. "Rest in peace Shane and Owen. My heart goes out to both of their families during this heartbreaking time."

New Zealand Hutt City councillor Brady Dyer posted on Facebook: "Shane was proud to be from Wainuiomata and was admired both locally and abroad for his skill and passion.

"This is a heartbreaking loss, and I know many in our community will be feeling it deeply."

Hippo, who sponsor Richardson's team, said: "As was his way Shane made instant friends with everyone he met, always welcoming, giving every visitor his undivided attention. 

"He brought a love of his sport into life for all to see."

Fellow New Zealand rider Cormac Buchanan said Shane was "truly one of the best people I ever had the privilege of sharing the track with".

Writing on Instagram, Buchanan said: "You never failed to put a smile on all of our faces. You were someone I could look up to and learn from and I am so lucky to have had your guidance in my first year in the UK.

"I cherish all of the track walks with you and Damo, the hard battles we had, bumping bars and swapping paint. I'm grateful to have been able to consider you a competitor, rival, and a friend. I always felt your support no matter what the situation, race, or outcome was".

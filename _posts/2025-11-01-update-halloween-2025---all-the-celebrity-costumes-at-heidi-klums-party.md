Let's dive into the details: It is officially the scariest night of the year and, while everyone in Hollywood and beyond has been showing off their elaborate costumes, there is one party we're all watching. 

Heidi Klum has cemented her place as the official Queen of spooky season thanks to her wild, weird and wonderful costumes and her annual bash that attracts celebrities across the globe. 

She had kept fans on their toes all day, dropping snippets of her costume on Instagram in the lead up to her party - despite being one of the last arrivals of the night - and she did not disappoint.

Following her notorious worm and peacock costumes in recent years, the Project Runway star took her animal theme to new levels as a bright green, and pretty hideous, Medusa. 

She slithered up the carpet with several moving snakes protruding from her intricate headpiece, sticking her vile tongue out at the waiting photographers.

Although she warned fans that her costume would be "very ugly", this probably isn't what anyone expected.

Heidi collaborated with Oscar-nominated make-up artist Mike Marino once again to pull off her costume, with a team of more than 35 people working hard to ensure she had all eyes on her.

As the festivities continue, here is a look at some of the most impressive outfits at Heidiween 2025 and beyond.

But it's not all about Hollywood (or Heidiwood). Even politicians are getting in on the action, including President Trump, who is hosting a party at his Florida home.

Like Heidi, her husband Tom Kaulitz, is never one to shy away from playing dress up. 

He was by her side arriving to the party as a man who was unfortunately turned to stone after looking directly at Medusa. 

The Tokio Hotel musician committed to the bit by posing with his weapon and shield raised, suggesting Medusa's appearance caught him by surprise moments before his demise.

Ice-T and Coco Austin have never shied away from going all out for Halloween, and are regulars at Heidi's annual bash. This year was no different as the rapper looked menacing in a red hooded jumpsuit, hiding his face with a blood-splattered white mask. He had a selection of weapons on hand to make his costume truly terrifying.

Model Coco also got the horror memo in a bright red wig and denim bodysuit, with Chucky's tagline: "Wanna play?" scrawled across the front, layered on top of a striped, long-sleeved turtleneck top. 

YouTuber James Charles carried his own head as he made his way into the party, reminiscent of Jared Leto's red carpet arrival at the 2019 Met Gala.

The beauty vlogger put his own spin on things as a "headless horseman" and even filmed a make-up tutorial on Instagram for his unique accessory.

Darren Criss may have taken some inspiration from his host as he donned a Shrek costume, including bright green face paint, a prosthetic nose and huge stomach, which he patted in front of the cameras.

Not quite as epic as when Heidi did the same in 2018, the Glee star switched his efforts up with tartan red trousers alongside wife Mia Swier - who chose not to be his Princess Fiona, but instead Puss in Boots, complete with a black cape and a hair thong.

Olympian Ilona Maher was a real-life vintage Barbie at Klum's Halloween party, modelling a strapless sparkly custom black Undone by Kate gown. She accessorized simply with black opera gloves and a chunky gold necklace.

Unveiling her outfit on Instagram, the rugby player proudly posed with her very own Barbie doll, as well as a handkerchief emblazoned with the phrase: "Beast. Beauty. Brains. Barbie."

Not every costume has gone down well, with some saying that US model Julia Fox's costume as a blood-soaked Jackie Kennedy was in poor taste.

Others have been more popular. 

Singer Demi Lovato recreated her "Poot Lovato" meme which went viral on Tumblr in 2015 - a reference to her alter-ego who has been locked in a basement.

Other highlights on social media include Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's daughter North West and her friends dressing up as Japanese kawaii-metal band BABYMETAL.

Maria Carey also went for Japanese theme, with hot pink hair and a frilly pastel blue dress, and posting "Happy Halloween from Japan" in a photo with her two twin children.

Rapper Megan Thee Stallion opted for portraying Choso from the Manga series Jujutsu Kaisen.

Singer Jade, formerly of girl group Little Mix, dressed up as Greta from the Gremlins, while the Cat in the Hat's famous aesthetic was recreated by singer Janelle Monae.

Elsewhere, Paris Hilton recreated the famous look from Britney Spears's music video for Oops!... I Did It Again.

Actress Keke Palmer channelled her inner rapper by dressing up as Snoop Dogg (and lip-synching to his music).

Actress and BLACKPINK member Lisa looked dazzling as The Golden Woman from the animated series Love, Death + Robots.

Kourtney Kardashian Barker is famously a big Halloween fan, with this year's costume serving as a nod to the Bride of Frankenstein.

Lizzo, who dressed up as a weight loss drug last year, called Halloween "so cheesy" as she dressed this year as a mozzarella stick, complete with an oozing cheese dress and boots.

Content creator and media personality Amelia Dimoldenberg never takes the easy option when it comes to dressing up for Halloween and this devilish costume certainly looks like it required some effort.

The night earlier, on the eve of Halloween, she went to a party in New York as the divorce of singer Lily Allen and Stranger Things actor David Harbour. Dressed as Harbour's sheriff character, she listened to the latest Allen album, which references their breakup. 

And singer Ed Sheeran dressed up as Pennywise the clown, Stephen King's character from It.

Meanwhile, US Vice-President JD Vance wore a wig as he became the bizarre meme-version of himself. That same meme is alleged to have gotten a Norwegian tourist banned from the US earlier this year.

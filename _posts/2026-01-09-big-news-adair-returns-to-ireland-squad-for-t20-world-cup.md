Let's dive into the details: Ross Adair missed Ireland's three T20s in Bangladesh last year

Ireland opener Ross Adair has been named in a 15-man squad for next month's T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka. 

The former Ulster rugby player had originally been included in Heinrich Malan's squad for the tour of Bangladesh in November but withdrew because of a bone stress in his knee. 

His return to the panel means that Ireland's squad is the same as the one that they originally intended to travel for the three-game series which they lost 2-1. 

Adair, who has a T20 century to his name against South Africa in September 2024 and averages 28.84 in the format, contributed 26 and 33 against England in his most recent internationals when opening the batting alongside captain Paul Stirling. 

In his absence against the Tigers, Tim Tector was promoted into the starting line-up and averaged 29 across the three matches with a high score of 38.

Ireland are in a group with Sri Lanka, Australia, Oman and Zimbabwe at the World Cup, opening against the hosts in Colombo on 8 February. 

All four of their pool games will be played in Sri Lanka as the side look to improve upon their winless showing at the tournament in the USA two years ago that included a shock 12-run defeat by Canada. 

Before their opening match next month, they will face Italy three times and the UAE twice in a series of warm-up fixtures between 23-31 January. 

Ireland T20 squad for T20 World Cup: Paul Stirling (capt), Mark Adair, Ross Adair, Ben Calitz, Curtis Campher, Gareth Delany, George Dockrell, Matthew Humphreys, Josh Little, Barry McCarthy, Harry Tector, Tim Tector, Lorcan Tucker (wk), Ben White, Craig Young

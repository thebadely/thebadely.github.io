Let's dive into the details: A food redistribution charity is appealing for help to fight food poverty during the school summer holidays.

FareShare Sussex & Surrey has launched its summer appeal amid an expected surge in demand during the school break.

Its latest impact report revealed that the charity supported more than 28,500 people every week through a network of 248 charities and community groups, with one in five children at risk of missing meals during the summer holidays.

Dan Slatter, the branch's chief executive, said: "Food insecurity is worsening across Sussex and Surrey, and the need for our support is greater than ever."

He added: "Every pound donated to our summer appeal helps us keep our warehouses open, our vans on the road and nutritious food flowing to school holiday clubs, community fridges, shelters and support centres."

The charity, which gathers surplus food and redistributes it to those in need, said it provided 6.26 million meals last year, saving local organisations Â£16.5m in costs.

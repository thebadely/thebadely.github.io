Experts revealed that Ireland head coach Andy Farrell will lead the British and Irish Lions in Australia

British and Irish Lions legend Willie John McBride feels the summer's tour of Australia will be "tougher than people expect".

Coach Andy Farrell will name his squad for the tour of Australia later on Thursday with England's Maro Itoje expected to be named as captain.

After slipping down the world rankings, Australia have improved under Joe Schmidt ahead of the three Test matches with the Lions.

"It's not an easy one," said McBride, who captained the Lions' famous 'invincibles' tour of South Africa in 1974.

"Joe Schmidt is there and he has been rebuilding the Australian team." 

McBride added that the Lions will travel Down Under as "favourites", but that tag does not have any value unless it is backed up on the pitch. 

The five-time Lions tourist added that Farrell "has done a superb job" with Ireland and backed him to replicate that in Australia.

"To go to the other side of the world and sort out a team is quite a job in the short distance that they have," the 84-year-old said.

"Andy Farrell has done a superb job for Ireland. He has done it with his feet on the ground and done it calmly. 

"He has built up a terrific squad and I think he will do the same thing for the Lions." 

McBride feels that Farrell, who has won two Six Nations titles with Ireland, is a strong "figurehead" to lead the tour.

"He has a good eye for the game and I think he'll develop this team," McBride added.

"He has had time to look at what players he has and see what type of game he wants to play.

"He has a good coaching team as well. Along with the captain and the rest of the coaches, he pulls it all together."

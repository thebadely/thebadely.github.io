It has been recently reported that McEntee succeeded Enda McGinley as Saffrons boss in 2022

Andy McEntee has stepped down from his role as Antrim manager after his three-year term came to an end.

McEntee took over as Saffron boss in 2022, replacing Enda McGinley, having previously managed his native Meath for six years.

During his first two years in charge, Antrim reached two Tailteann Cup semi-finals and consolidated their place in Division Three.

This season they suffered relegation to Division Four after a tough National League campaign.

They also exited the Tailteann Cup at the quarter-final stage after a defeat heavy 5-23 to 2-21 defeat by Wexford, which proved to be McEntee's last game in charge.

"We would sincerely like to thank Andy and his entire backroom team for their service and commitment to our senior footballers during their term," an Antrim "GAA statement said.

We wish you and your family the best of wishes for the future. You will always be welcome in the Saffron County."

It comes after the news that Antrim captain Dermot McAleese called time on his 12-year inter-county career earlier this month.

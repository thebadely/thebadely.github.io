Let's dive into the details: After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.

Here are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.

Robin Roefs (Sunderland): The reason Sunderland ended up getting a win at Nottingham Forest was because of him. He made about seven top saves in the game - very good. When he came in there were a lot of question marks around dropping Anthony Patterson who had gone through the leagues with them. Roefs has been solid since he's been in the Premier League.

Santiago Bueno (Wolves): He scored in the draw at Spurs and was excellent. I thought that whole Wolves performance was one that should have warranted a win and more than they got. But Joao Palhinha's finish was super and just oozed quality. For Wolves they will feel like they can't catch a break at this moment in time but if they perform like that then obviously they are going to be all right.

Joe Rodon (Leeds): He's at the heart of what Leeds do well. He's physical, good on the ball, knows when to go, knows when to hold. I just think he had a really good all-round game in the draw with Bournemouth and it was a fantastic header as well. He was unlucky not to score two.

Omar Alderete (Sunderland): That back six had an unbelievable game. They dug in, they ground out a win and it just goes to show, especially for new teams coming up, it doesn't matter how you win. You've just got to get the win and get it done. I thought Alderete was exquisite.

Tyrick Mitchell (Crystal Palace): Mitchell was unbelievable in the win against Liverpool. Everyone will say Liverpool weren't great but you have to be able to defend and deliver like that. I think he kept Mo Salah really quiet. He is just an underrated, steady performer. You know what you are going to get out of him. Very rarely - if ever - does he have a bad game where it is noticeable. 

Eberechi Eze (Arsenal): In the number 10 position he was easily the best player on the pitch in the win at Newcastle. If it wasn't for Nick Pope he would have had a hat-trick on the day. He opens up so much for Viktor Gyokeres, for Bukayo Saka, for Leandro Trossard. You have so much to worry about because he just blends into these wonderful positions, he can shoot from the edge of the box which now nobody is really doing. Once he is shooting, it forced the defending team to come out and try and close the shots down which opens up space for other people. He was great.

Granit Xhaka (Sunderland): Proper captain's performance. Granit Xhaka has gone in there from Bayer Leverkusen. He is learning, he is holding this group together, holding them all accountable, driving them forward. It was a real dogged performance and he was at the heart of it. That Sunderland win was huge. Away from home against Forest and they got absolutely peppered but just dug in and they will go from strength to strength.

John McGinn (Aston Villa): Back-to-back goals, he scored in Europe [against Bologna] and came off with a slight concern of injury but he was a driving force behind that Villa win against Fulham, especially when they went 1-0 down. He was the one setting the tempo and setting the press. Good to see him back in the middle of the park - I think he adds so much more there.

Yankuba Minteh (Brighton): Once Chelsea went down to 10 men Minteh just took over the game, but before that when they were under the cosh he was the only player for Brighton that was taking them 30 yards up the pitch. He had a real intent in their win. He looked like he wanted to prove to Chelsea that 'if you're going to buy someone from Brighton, I might be the next one'. Very good, very deliberate. The assist for Danny Welbeck's first goal was unreal. He gets past Malo Gusto and just whips in this ball and as a striker all you have to do is put your head on it and guide it. It was a wonderful goal.

Igor Thiago (Brentford): He was an absolute monster in the win against Manchester United and an absolute nightmare for the likes of Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire. A big, strong, physical forward who can not only link up the play but can run in behind and when he hit that first one, you could have two goalies in and they wouldn't have saved it. He hit it on the half-volley and with the ball rising it is really difficult for strikers. It was really well controlled, he gets the goal he deserved and then gets his second one. He has been great at leading the line for Brentford all season.

Erling Haaland (Manchester City): Two goals as they thrashed Burnley and an assist. He doesn't get as much credit because it was against the Clarets but all summer we have spoken about Alexander Isak and the other boys. The governor is back. The king is back. Long live the king.

Unai Emery (Aston Villa): Massive, massive week for him. They were in the bottom three at the start of the week, big win in Europe, gets them off to a flier and then this week he gets his team to pull a performance out of the fire. They were 1-0 down to Fulham, Ollie Watkins is back scoring and Morgan Rogers provided an assist. It feels the team is moving in the right direction. The transfer window has closed and everyone is now settled. It feels like we are going to start seeing Villa do what they should do.

Sean Longstaff (Leeds)

A last-gasp Bournemouth equaliser on Saturday may have been painful for the Elland Road faithful but the performance of Sean Longstaff gives Daniel Farke and co much hope for the rest of the season.

In a standout display, the former Newcastle United man both scored and assisted in an English league game for just the second time in his career, after also doing so for Blackpool v Doncaster Rovers in August 2017 in League One, to give the hosts a share of the spoils.

On top of that, Longstaff also created seven goalscoring chances for team-mates, the most by any player in a top-flight game this season and the joint-most by a Leeds player on record (since 2003-04).

Igor Thiago (Brentford)

The post-Thomas Frank era at Brentford was never going to be easy, but under the tutelage of former set-piece coach Keith Andrews the Bees are finding their feet, with Saturday's 3-1 win over Manchester United the highlight so far.

Igor Thiago was the star of the show at Gtech Community Stadium, becoming just the second player to score twice in the opening 20 minutes of a top-flight game against United, after Alexis Sanchez for Arsenal in October 2015.

The Brazilian, who has big Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo-shaped boots to fill, secured his double from three shots in the game, with the London side's hitman netting four of Brentford's nine goals in the Premier League this season.

Robin Roefs (Sunderland)

Sunderland's superb start to their first Premier League campaign since 2016-17 continued at the weekend, courtesy of a hard-fought 1-0 win at Nottingham Forest.

The visitors had goalkeeper Robin Roefs to thank with the Dutchman making six saves, a joint-high at the weekend, while he also created two goalscoring chances, with only one goalkeeper on record (Wayne Hennessey with three for Burnley v Manchester United in 2021) registering more in a Premier League game since 2003-04.

Overall, Roefs has now kept three clean sheets in six Premier League appearances this season, a haul only Newcastle United's Nick Pope can better, with four, while his tally of 20 saves gives him a top-three ranking in the division.

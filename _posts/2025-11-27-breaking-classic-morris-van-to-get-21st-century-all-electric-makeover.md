Let's dive into the details: A classic 1950s van that was once a common sight on Britain's roads is set to make a return after getting a 21st Century makeover in south Wales.

An all-electric version of the retro Morris J-Type - known as the Morris JE - will be produced at Bro Tathan in St Athan, Vale of Glamorgan.

The project will also create about 150 "highly skilled jobs", the Welsh government said. Morris Commercial said the reimagined van would retain a number of its original features, including the pear-shaped grille.

Cabinet Secretary Rebecca Evans called it an "exciting project" that would "benefit from the robust automotive sector and supply chain cluster we are developing here in Wales".

She said Wales was "a natural home" for the Morris JE, with its innovative landscape and support for low carbon concepts.

"Well-paid jobs will also be created for skilled workers as the company delivers this historic retro van into the electric vehicle era," she added.

Morris Commercial is being given financial support from the Welsh government's Economy Futures Funding to establish the production facility - Wales' first for electric vehicles.

Morris Commercial's chief executive, Dr Qu Li, said it was an "exciting" new facility which "will enable us to start to deliver vehicles to long waited customers".

The all-electric version will be a zero-emission and carbon-neutral vehicle, with the new aluminium chassis and carbon-fibre body made partly from recycled materials, the Welsh government said.

It will have a 250-mile (about 400km) range. 

The reimagined Morris JE is due to be launched in late 2026.

According to new developments, The TikToker behind the viral Apple dance has settled a lawsuit against Roblox.

Influencer Kelley Heyer had accused the online platform of copying her choreography, inspired by the Charli XCX song of the same name, without her permission.

Her legal team claimed Roblox had made $123,000 (£93,000) from selling the moves as an emote - a celebratory animation used by players 

Court papers filed in the US this week said that Kelley and the Roblox Corporation had agreed to dismiss the case, and a joint statement said both sides had "amicably resolved" the issue.

"The parties wish each other every success in their creative pursuits and encouraging the creating pursuits of others," they said.

The Apple dance became a huge TikTok trend last summer and has since become a feature of Charli XCX's live shows. 

Kelley previously told BBC Newsbeat she was happy to see others performing her dance, but was "bummed out" when brands and big creators did so without crediting her.

She was reportedly in talks with Roblox to license the Apple dance but her lawyer said the company used it without a "signed agreement".

In a court response, Roblox's legal team said Ms Heyer had not registered copyright for the Apple dance and had given the company permission to use it.

It released the emote as part of a Charli XCX-themed concert within Dress to Impress, a popular game available on the platform.

They said this was done after they reached an agreement to license the dance for $9,000 (£6,700) in the run-up to the event.

Kelley's lawyer Miki Anzai previously said she "should be compensated fairly for her work" and they "saw no other option" but to bring the case to court.

About 80 million people play Roblox every day, and it has more monthly users than the Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation combined.

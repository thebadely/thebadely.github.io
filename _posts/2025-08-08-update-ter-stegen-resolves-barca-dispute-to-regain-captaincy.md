Experts revealed that Marc-Andre ter Stegen helped Barcelona win the Champions League in 2014-15

Marc-Andre ter Stegen has been reinstated as Barcelona captain and disciplinary proceedings against him dropped in a dramatic 24-hour turnaround.

The German keeper had been stripped of the armband on Thursday because of a dispute centred around surgery on a back injury in July. 

Barcelona would reportedly have been able to clear 80% of his wages until mid-season if the 33-year-old was classed as a long-term absentee, freeing up funds to allow them to register new players.

However, Ter Stegen recently published a post on social media saying he would be out for three months, whereas La Liga rules require a player to remain sidelined for at least four to be considered a long-term absentee.

He had also reportedly, external been unwilling to allow Barca to share his medical data with La Liga. 

But Barca said Ter Stegen has now signed the relevant forms giving them authorisation to send the medical report.

In a social media post earlier on Friday, the keeper said he was "fully willing to collaborate with the club's management to resolve this matter and to provide the requested authorisation".

Ter Stegen added the suggestion his injury absence was being used as tool for Barcelona to register new players was "both unfair and inaccurate".

"I would also like to clarify that all of the club's signings and contract renewals were completed prior to my surgery," he said.

"At no point could I consider that my unfortunate circumstances with the new surgery I had to undergo would be necessary for the registration of other colleagues whom I greatly respect and look forward to share [a] locker room with for many seasons.

"I understand that difficult moments can generate tension, but I trust that, through dialogue and responsibility, we can resolve this situation constructively."

The La Liga champions' summer signings have included the arrival of keeper Joan Garcia from Espanyol and England striker Marcus Rashford on loan from Manchester United.

Ter Stegen has made more than 400 appearances for Barcelona since joining from Borussia Monchengladbach in 2014, and his honours include winning the Champions League and six La Liga titles.

Hansi Flick was appointed Barcelona boss in the summer of 2024.

Manager Hansi Flick will miss Barcelona's first Champions League match of the season after being sanctioned by Uefa for misconduct.

The German has been given a one-match ban and fined Â£17,000 by the European governing body's disciplinary committee.

Flick was critical of several refereeing decisions during Barca's 4-3 Champions League semi-final second-leg defeat to Inter Milan in May, with the Spanish club losing 7-6 on aggregate.

His assistant Marcus Sorg has been handed the same punishment.

The opening round of the Champions League takes place from 16 to 18 September.

Former Bayern Munich and Germany boss Flick was appointed as Barcelona manager in June 2024 and won La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the Spanish Super Cup in his first season.

In a separate decision, Barcelona forwards Lamine Yamal and Robert Lewandowski have each been fined Â£4,300 for failing to comply with instructions from an anti-doping officer and not immediately reporting to a control post at the same game.

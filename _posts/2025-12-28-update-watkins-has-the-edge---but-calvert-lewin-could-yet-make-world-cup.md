Calvert-Lewin equalises for Leeds United to draw with Sunderland

One goal in his first 10 Premier League appearances this season had many questioning whether Dominic Calvert-Lewin's best days were behind him.

But, only four weeks on, he's the most talked-about striker in England after scoring seven goals in six games.

His latest goal, in the 1-1 draw against Sunderland, took his tally to eight for the season, making him the leading English scorer in the Premier League this campaign.

The 28-year-old signed for the Whites on a free transfer in the summer after a nine-year spell with Everton, which ended with a series of injuries hampering his final seasons. 

But the numbers behind his resurgence in Daniel Farke's new counter-attacking 3-5-2 formation are impressive.

His six-game streak places him in elite company as only the 11th English player to score in six or more consecutive Premier League appearances. 

To put that into perspective, even England captain Harry Kane never managed a run this long - his best stands at two separate five-match streaks. 

And the only English striker to better Calvert-Lewin in recent memory is Jamie Vardy, who went on an eight-game scoring spree for Leicester City in 2019. 

So could Calvert-Lewin yet force his way into Thomas Tuchel's England squad for the World Cup?

Leeds 'brimming with confidence' in full-team goal - Murphy

What has made Calvert-Lewin so hard to stop in recent weeks? Sunderland boss Regis Le Bris summed it up perfectly after the Leeds frontman struck at the Stadium of Light.

All 11 visiting players touched the ball during a flowing Leeds move, which ended when Calvert-Lewin turned a low cross from Brenden Aaronson past Sunderland goalkeeper Robin Roefs. 

"He has the perfect timing," said Le Bris. "He came off the back of Nordi [Mukiele to score]. He's smart and a really good striker and he found the timing to arrive just on time."

That instinct and timing inside the box was what made him a fan favourite at Everton, for whom he scored 57 goals in 239 league appearances.

"Leeds changing to a 3-5-2 formation has also helped in getting more players in the box to occupy defenders, which has given him a little more space," said former Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy, who is a pundit on Sunday's Match of the Day.

"Leeds have also played to his strengths recently, getting the ball into the box as early as they can, making sure they're giving him enough chances to score goals."

Former Chelsea and Everton winger Pat Nevin told BBC Radio 5 Live: "There was one occasion in the first half that had he gone to the front post, he would have had a tap in. He didn't and the chance was missed. 

"But the thing about him is that he is a classic centre-forward, [thinking] 'OK I've learned my lesson, next time get beyond the front post'.

"For the goal he did that and it was a lovely little flick beyond the keeper, a classic centre-forward's goal.

"For the fact that he did not have massive amounts to do in the game today, the things he did do were exceptionally classy."

Calvert-Lewin is impressive but the team deserves the praise - Farke

Although his recent form is impressive, he has some way to go to reach his best haul of 21 in all competitions for the Toffees in 2020-21 under Carlo Ancelotti. 

"That was a long time ago," Calvert-Lewin told BBC Match of the Day.

"I've been through a lot since then. Lots of ups and lots of downs. A test of character and I've hung in there and kept going and kept pushing. I've backed myself and here I am now.

"It's always a good feeling to be scoring regularly. I'm in a good moment at the minute. My timing is good.

"I'm feeling good, feeling strong and I'm enjoying playing with the lads."

But for Farke, this purple patch comes as no surprise, and the Leeds boss reiterated that Calvert-Lewin is "one of the best strikers" in the Premier League. 

"He deserves all the praise," Farke said. "He is in record form and long may it continue.

"It's his job, he should score the goals, but I would also always back him to be there. I was not surprised by this run because for me he is one of the best strikers in this league and he shows this quality more or less in each and every game."

Calvert-Lewin's resurgence has inevitably sparked talks of an England recall.  

The former Sheffield United player has 11 England caps, scoring four goals. But he has not represented the nation since Euro 2020.

Murphy believes the striker will be in contention to go to the World Cup if he can keep this run going.

"He looks as fit as he has in a long time," he said.

"That comes with playing consecutive games, scoring goals, then your confidence goes up as well. You can see he's got that strut back, that kind of confidence and belief in himself. Nobody's ever doubted his ability or attributes.

"If he maintains this level of form until the end of the season, then he's going to be in a conversation for a World Cup place because his level at the moment is really high and he offers something different.

"He is fantastic in the air and could give teams real problems off the bench." 

Dominic Calvert-Lewin has scored four goals in 11 appearances for England

But competition for places behind Kane is fierce. 

Danny Welbeck has scored seven goals for Brighton this season - only one short of Calvert-Lewin - while Marcus Rashford has rediscovered his form at Barcelona. 

Ivan Toney, currently at Saudi Pro League side Al-Ahli, was used as an impact substitute during Euro 2024.

But it is Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, fresh off his double that sunk Chelsea on Saturday, who is currently ahead of Calvert-Lewin, according to Murphy. 

"If you compare the two players, Watkins has the edge in terms of using his pace to stretch teams and get in behind," he said.

"I'm not saying Calvert-Lewin doesn't want to run in behind, because he does, but I think Watkins has the edge when it comes to speed.

"He also has the edge when it comes to making a meaningful impact at a major tournament. Calvert-Lewin made two substitute appearances at Euro 2020 but Watkins had that big moment by scoring the winner in the semi-final against the Netherlands at Euro 2024.

"He will also have a slight advantage in terms of understanding and relationships with the players in the current squad."

Whether Calvert-Lewin will be with England next summer could hinge on how many specialist strikers Tuchel wants to have in his squad.

"Every player dreams of England and Calvert-Lewin has been in the squad before, scored goals and shown he is capable at that level, so will have that belief in himself," Murphy added.

"I think it might come down to whether Tuchel takes two or three centre-forwards. If it is three, he definitely has a chance."

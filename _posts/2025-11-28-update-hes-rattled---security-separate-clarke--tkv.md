Watch security separate Clarke and TKV at weigh-in

A riled-up Frazer Clarke swore at Jeamie 'TKV' Tshikeva's team as tempers flared at a testy weigh-in for Saturday's British heavyweight title bout in Derby.

After both men hit the scales - Clarke at 19st 4lb (123 kg) and TKV at 18st 12lb (120 kg) - a fiery standoff erupted. 

Words were exchanged and voices gradually rose, and security stepped in as tensions threatened to boil over.

Clarke then stuck both middle fingers up at TKV's small entourage, reigniting the verbal sparring.

"I'll take this boy to school and beat him up," Clarke, 34, warned. The next time they meet will be at the Vaillant Arena, with the bout broadcast live on BBC Two.

The rivalry between the two Britons has intensified since their original October 25 fight was postponed because of an injury to TKV, which Clarke has publicly questioned.

"He's a funny character. I walked past him in the corridor, didn't do anything, but when security is around he wants to talk funny," 32-year-old TKV said. "That really shows his character."

The weigh-in was open to the public, with a couple of hundred fans packed into a hotel function room near East Midlands Airport.

Clarke left the stage but heckled from the floor, shouting "one round", to which TKV shot back: "You carry on nodding your head and I'll knock you out tomorrow."

TKV admitted he was trying to "rattle" Clarke 

Clarke - from nearby Burton-upon-Trent - appeared confident, mingling with his family and picking up his young son, who sported a tracksuit with 'Big Fraze' emblazoned on it.

But the mood turned tense when both men faced each other - over 500lbs of heavyweights on stage.

Afterwards, both spoke to BBC Sport, with the focus on who had won the psychological battle.

"He feels I have been dominating the talking. Yesterday upset him. He is rattled. I've won in that sense," Londoner TKV said.

"That is the game. The whole point is to rattle Frazer, and mission accomplished," he added.

"He's going to fight with emotions. Once he's rattled, he won't stick to the game plan, and he won't be the same fighter in the ring."

At Thursday's news conference, Clarke outlined his ambition to become a world champion and possibly face WBO belt holder Fabio Wardley again, after drawing with him in March 2024 before being knocked out seven months later.

"I'm still calm. They can't get in my head. I've been down, I've been in the muddy water, and I'm back," Clarke said.

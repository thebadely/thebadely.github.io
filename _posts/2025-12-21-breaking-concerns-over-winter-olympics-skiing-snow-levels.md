Experts revealed that Livigno Snow Park (pictured) and Aerials and Moguls Park are venues at the 2026 Winter Olympics, with 26 gold medals available in events staged there

Concerns over snow levels for the skiing events at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Italy have been raised by the president of the International Ski Federation (FIS).

Johan Eliasch highlighted issues with the production of artificial snow, which he said was down to delays with the Italian government releasing funds to organisers.

Livigno Snow Park and Aerials and Moguls Park will be key venues during February's Winter Olympics.

Livigno mayor Remo Galli has responded to the concerns, stating that the delays were caused by a technical problem.

"We'll have all the snow we need to have a great Olympics. In fact, we'll have much more," Galli told Italian news agency Ansa.

"It was necessary to replace a valve, but it was done within the timeframe, and all the snow guns have been operating for a few evenings.

"We're doing well, for Livigno and for Italy. And in the next few days, temperatures will drop further, even to 20 below zero, so I'm not at all worried."

The venues in Livigno must produce large quantities of artificial snow to create the halfpipes and jumps needed for snowboarding and freestyle skiing events.

Eliasch described the funding issues as "inexplicable".

"But I hope it will all work out. We have a plan B, a plan C, and a plan D," he continued.

"It's unfortunate to find ourselves in a situation we should never have been in. We call them three times a day - morning, noon, and night."

Earlier this month, NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly said players will not take part in the 2026 Winter Olympics if issues with ice quality were not resolved.

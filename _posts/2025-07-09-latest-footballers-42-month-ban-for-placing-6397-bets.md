Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Ryan Bowman placed six bets on himself to score in games

Former Cheltenham, Shrewsbury and Exeter striker Ryan Bowman has been banned for three-and-a-half years by the Football Association for placing 6,397 bets over an eight year period.

The 33-year-old, who was released by Cheltenham this summer, admitted all of the charges.

It was alleged he had made a bet from the substitutes bench on a game between Shrewsbury and MK Dons that was already under way in January 2023, something he denied.

Bowman placed almost 2,600 bets from December 2020 until July 2021 while he was at Exeter and another 3,100 between August 2021 and July 2023 while playing for Shrewsbury.

Bowman made his last appearance for Cheltenham on 1 January.

His ban, which started in March, will run until September 2028. 

"This is a most serious case which includes a number of egregious examples of breaches of The FA Rules against betting," the independent regulatory commission's written reasons said. 

Bowman placed eight bets against Shrewsbury, with three while he played the entirety of the match.  

He placed another six spot bets on himself to score during games.

In total, 351 of the bets included games in competitions that Exeter and Shrewsbury participated in. He also placed 87 bets on his own clubs, 47 involving Shrewsbury.  

"While we are disappointed with the severity of the offences, we have done everything in our power to support Ryan and his family," a Shrewsbury statement said.

A Cheltenham statement said they were aware he was under investigation by the FA when Bowman signed for them in July 2024. 

"The full extent of the offences was not known until October, when charges were brought under the FA's betting regulations," the statement said.

"Club officials supported Ryan through what has been a difficult time for him and despite his departure from Cheltenham Town this summer, again we would like to place on record our thanks to him and wish him and his family all the best for the future."

Exeter City confirmed they would not be making a comment. 

Bowman began his career with Carlisle and played for National League sides Darlington, Hereford, Torquay and Gateshead.

He signed for Motherwell in 2016 and then joined Exeter three years later, scoring 34 goals in 112 matches.

He moved to Shrewsbury in 2021, playing 135 games scoring 22 goals. In June 2022 he underwent heart surgery after experiencing heart palpitations during a game. 

He made 22 appearances for Cheltenham last season, scoring three goals but did not feature in a matchday squad after 1 January.

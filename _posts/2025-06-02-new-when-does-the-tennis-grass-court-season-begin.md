According to new developments, Tennis' 2025 grass court season officially started on 2 June with the Birmingham Open.

The full grass court season lasts for just 41 days, coming to a close following the conclusion of Wimbledon on 13 July.

The period consists of a small number of tournaments, with Wimbledon being the sole Grand Slam on grass.

The Queen's Club Championships and Halle Open are both ATP 500 events which take place during the grass court season.

Among the reasons for the short grass season are the close proximities between the French Open being played across May and June and Wimbledon, which takes place across June and July.

Other reasons for a shorter grass court season include the significant extra cost required in maintaining grass courts compared to hard or clay surfaces, and the fact that they are much more susceptible to damage from bad weather.

There are also significantly fewer grass tennis courts than there are other surfaces.

The hard court season lasts between the end of July and middle of March. The primary clay court season, including the French Open, takes place between March and June.

Grass court tennis tends to be faster-paced, with the grass contributing to a lower bounce of the ball.

This therefore favours players who specialise in serve and volley tennis, as well as big servers.

Clay court tennis is the opposite to grass, with the ball bouncing slower but higher. Clay courts tend to favour players who stick to the baseline and specialise in executing drop shots.

Hard courts are a balance between grass and clay tennis, favouring players who stick to the baseline and are good at maintaining longer rallies.

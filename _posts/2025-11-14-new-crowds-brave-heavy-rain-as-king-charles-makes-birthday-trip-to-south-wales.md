Let's dive into the details: King Charles made a visit to a wet and windy south Wales on his 77th birthday.

Accompanied by Queen Camilla, he went to Cyfarthfa Castle in Merthyr Tydfil, where he met local cultural figures, including Ruth Jones, star of the BBC comedy Gavin and Stacey.

At a reception, the King cut a birthday cake made in the shape of the 200-year-old castle and later met crowds sheltering under umbrellas from Storm Claudia.

Earlier in the day, Buckingham Palace issued a new photograph of the King, showing him at his Sandringham estate in Norfolk, holding a shepherd's crook.

During the Cyfarthfa Castle visit, he met people from the local community involved in the arts and culture.

Ruth Jones told the King about writing a new TV comedy about a middle-aged couple who "get together second time around". But not Gavin and Stacey, she said.

The King met TikToker Lewis Leigh, whose parents Neil and Kerry Anne from Merthyr Tydfil said they were feeling "really proud" of their son.

"We are so proud that he will be recognised for some of the hard work he's done with cancer awareness and school visits," said Neil.

Love Island star Liam Reardon joked with the King about going to the gym.

"I'm opening a gym next week, so if you fancy a little session, let me know," said Reardon.

Andrew Lewis, head teacher at Gwaunfarren Primary School, said pupils were "super excited" to see the visit. 

"We broke the news at the start of the week. It's a once in a lifetime experience for our children."

Noah, aged 10, said about the King's visit: "I think he'll like the castle, it's really big and it has loads of stuff inside."

During the trip to south Wales, Queen Camilla heard pupils reading poetry at Cyfarthfa Primary School.

And King Charles officially opened the South Wales Metro Depot in Taff's Well, near Cardiff, and tried his hand at driving a tram-train.

The trip to south Wales is a sign of the King's determination to keep working, even though he is still receiving regular cancer treatment.

The King's visit coincided with the heavy rain brought by Storm Claudia.

It's been a stormy few weeks for the royals too, with the removal of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's title and his status as prince, over links to the paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.

The scandal has cast a shadow over what otherwise has been a busy autumn schedule for the King, with the state visit by US President Donald Trump, the King's historic meeting with Pope Leo at the Vatican and this week's annual Remembrance events.

Although this is only the third year of his reign, Charles at the age of 77 is now in fifth place in the longest-lived British monarchs.

He recently overtook George II, who in 1760 died a few days short of his 77th birthday.

The longest living monarchs were Elizabeth II, Victoria, George III and Edward VIII - who abdicated in 1936.

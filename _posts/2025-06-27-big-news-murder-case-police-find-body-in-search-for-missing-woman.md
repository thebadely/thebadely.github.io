Here’s what you need to know: Officers searching for missing Reanne Coulson have found a body and charged a man with her murder, West Midlands Police have said.

She had been missing for a month and failed to contact family on her birthday.

The body was discovered in Binley Woods, on the outskirts of Coventry, on Friday afternoon. Formal identification has yet to take place but police said they believed the body to be that of Ms Coulson.

Mohammed Durnion, 42, has been charged with murder while Adam Moore, 38, has been charged with assisting an offender.

Both men are due to appear at Coventry Magistrates‘ Court on Saturday.

On Thursday, West Midlands Police said a 53-year-old man who had previously been arrested on suspicion of murder and kidnap had since been released on bail with strict conditions.

Det Supt Jim Munro said the force had been focused on doing all it could to find Ms Coulson.

"We've charged a man with murder and another for assisting an offender, but our inquiries to establish exactly what happened and why are ongoing," he said.

Ms Coulson's older brother Ashley thanked the public for their help to find Reanne and asked that the family be left alone to grieve.

On Thursday, Ms Coulson's mother Lynne Sparkes issued an appeal as the search for her daughter intensified.

"From one parent to another, you can only imagine how I'm feeling. Please come forward to give our family some closure," Ms Sparkes said.

Speaking at a press conference on Monday, her family acknowledged that Ms Coulson had been a sex worker and said it was "out of the ordinary" for her to not return home.

"Reanne is not only my sister but my twin sister, a mother, a daughter and an aunt," Ms Coulson's sister Kirsten said during the press conference.

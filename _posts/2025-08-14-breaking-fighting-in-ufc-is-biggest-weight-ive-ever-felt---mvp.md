According to new developments, Michael 'Venom' Page has wins over Kevin Holland and Sharabutdin Magomedov in the UFC

Michael 'Venom' Page says the pressure and expectation that comes with fighting in the UFC is unlike anything else he has ever felt in his career.

London's Page - nicknamed MVP - signed with the UFC in 2023 after nine years with Bellator, where he built a reputation as one of the promotion's most dangerous and exciting fighters.

The 38-year-old won 16 of 18 fights in Bellator with a number of highlight-reel knockouts. 

Despite triumphing in two of his three bouts since joining the UFC, Page says the move has "carried a weight".

"Usually I go in there and I'm comfortable to fight but I've realised UFC carries a massive weight because of its reputation, its history and the credibility you carry from winning these fights," said Page.

"It's the biggest weight I've felt from any organisation."

Since Bellator was acquired by the PFL in 2023, Page is one of a number of fighters who left to continue their careers in the UFC.

Page's move has largely been a success but the other athletes have struggled.

Former Bellator featherweight and lightweight champion Patricio Pitbull has looked unconvincing, recording one win and one defeat. 

Ex-Bellator bantamweight title holder Patchy Mix, meanwhile, was outclassed by Mario Bautista on his UFC debut in June.

In the co-main event at UFC 319 in Chicago, Illinois on Saturday, Britain's Lerone Murphy faces Aaron Pico - another former Bellator fighter - in a featherweight contest.

Page, who faces American middleweight Jared Cannonier on the undercard, says he empathises with the former Bellator athletes who have struggled.

"I'm starting to see it more and more that the Bellator fighters are not performing the way I know they can," said Page.

"Pitbull has had a couple of fights and he hasn't looked like the Pitbull I've seen in Bellator - he was unbelievable. 

"I feel like the magnitude and weight they're carrying isn't allowing them to perform the way they could perform."

The fight with 41-year-old Cannonier represents Page's second successive bout at middleweight after he ended Magomedov's undefeated reign in February.

After spending the majority of his 13-year career at welterweight, Page says he has chosen to move up because he was struggling to secure fights in the lower weight class.

"Nobody at welterweight seems to like action - it's a slow division," said Page.

"I think there's a lot of people in the latter stage of their careers, so for them every fight means something a bit more.

"They don't want to take a risky fight, and I feel I represent a lot of risk because of the style I bring."

Page's only title fight during his career was against American Logan Storley for Bellator's interim welterweight belt in 2022, where he suffered a split decision defeat.

Page says competing in fights that "turn heads" is his main goal during the twilight of his career, but he has not given up on becoming a world champion.

The middleweight belt will be on the line in the main event at Chicago's United Centre as South African champion Dricus du Plessis faces Russia's Khamzat Chimaev.

"With someone so experienced and dangerous, I can't look past Jared," said Cannonier.

"But my goal is to get a title fight in my last run. For me I feel like this is my last lap in MMA, and I want to retire from MMA before MMA retires me," said Page. 

"I'm doing a lot of work in the background to set up the next stage of my life, so for now it's about getting big fights and pushing towards the title."

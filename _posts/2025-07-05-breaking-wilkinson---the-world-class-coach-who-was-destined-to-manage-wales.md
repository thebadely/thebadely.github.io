Here’s what you need to know: For Rhian Wilkinson, managing Wales felt like destiny.

After years of sliding doors moments for Wales' women, the arrival of a world class coach has led to a first major tournament qualification.

On the eve of their first competitive match at Euro 2025 against formidable foes in the Netherlands, Wilkinson says leading out Wales in Lucerne will be "right up there" as one of the proudest moments of her life, despite a glittering playing and coaching career.

"This is a wonderful team, great people, fantastic footballers, and we're going to be tested against some of the best in the world," she told BBC Sport Wales.

"And that's exactly what we've been wanting, to showcase Wales as a country and this team and their talent. 

"It will be right up there in the greatest moments of my career to stand there and watch these women take the field."

Despite only being appointed weeks before the start of Wales' qualifying campaign, Wilkinson's connection to Cymru runs far deeper.

In her own words, despite being a former Canadian international with 183 caps to her name, Wilkinson "feels Welsh".

Born in Canada, Wilkinson has a deep-rooted links to Wales having lived in Cowbridge for 18-months as a child.

With a Welsh mother (Shan) and an English father (Keith), Wilkinson says she has a big connection to the country.

Born in Quebec, Wilkinson lived in Cowbridge in south Wales and attended Bont Faen Primary School between 1989-1991.

Finally returning to Wales as the women's head coach in February 2024, Wilkinson admits it is a job that was on her mind for years.

"When the job came up after Jayne Ludlow stepped down, I was sorely tempted to apply," she said.

"I thought what an amazing opportunity it would be, but I had already verbally agreed to another job, it wasn't great timing for me.

"I was on holiday in Rome when I saw the news that (Ludlow's successor) Gemma Grainger had left. She and her staff had done such a wonderful job with the team, and I had followed the team closely. When it came up that she departed, I couldn't sleep that night.

"It was something that definitely interested me straight away and I thought this could be a very exciting move for me."

Wilkinson still has plenty of family members in Wales â her grandmother lives in Cowbridge and her aunt and uncle and cousins live in Cardiff - and she speaks glowingly of family holidays spent scaling Wales' highest peak, Yr Wyddfa.

Indeed, Wilkinson was instrumental in the decision to announce Wales' Euro 2025 squad at Yr Wyddfa -  also known as Snowdon - a destination with huge meaning for her, having been the place where her parents enjoyed their honeymoon. 

Six months before she became Wales manager, it was also the place where the Wilkinson family held a ceremony for her father after his death.

It was no surprise when Wilkinson opted to walk up the mountain â all 1,085 metres of it - rather than take the train on the day of the Wales squad announcement.

Wilkinson has always been someone who has scaled great heights in women's football, first as a player and then as a world class coach.

Wilkinson was a tough and formidable defender for Canada, though equally capable in midfield and she represented her country on the international stage from 2003 until 2017. 

Her 183 caps make her one of the 50 most capped female footballers in history and she played in four Olympic Games, winning bronze medals in 2012 and 2016.

Wilkinson's club career saw her star in the National Women's Soccer League and also play for a spell in Norway,

A college graduate with a major in communication and English from the university of Tennessee, Wilkinson's playing career and her natural leadership always made a coaching career a likely calling.

Wilkinson worked her way up, starting as an assistant and age-grade coach with Canada before working as an assistant for both the England national team and Team GB at the delayed Tokyo Olympic Games in 2021.

It was only a matter of time before a head coach role arrived and Wilkinson was appointed as Portland Thorns coach in 2021, winning the NWSL Championship in her first season.

However, Wilkinson was asked to stand-down after an investigation into a relationship with a player â there was no suggestion Wilkinson did anything wrong and the couple have subsequently married â with Wilkinson admitting that it was "a painful time" for her.

Wilkinson was out of football at the highest level for a year after her departure from Portland, before Grainger's shock resignation and move to Norway opened up a vacancy she had always thought about. She was appointed Wales boss in February 2024.

Football Association of Wales (FAW) chief football officer David Adams told BBC Sport Wales that the governing body chiefs were happy to appoint Wilkinson because "we followed all the right steps and she was exonerated by the NWSL".

For us. For them. For her

Unquestionably, it was not easy to hit the ground running as Wales boss, with the players angry and frustrated by Grainger's departure and wary of Wilkinson's appointment.

Initially there were certainly some issues in winning over the players who had hoped Grainger's assistant, Jon Grey, would be given the role.

Had it not of been for the circumstances of Wilkinson's departure from Portland, it might have been the case that Wales would have always remained a place where Wilkinson felt affinity, but not somewhere she was particularly minded to work.

However, it quickly became apparent that this was an ideal match, with Wilkinson succeeding in winning over the Wales squad over a 15-month period where results spoke for themselves.

Wilkinson steered Wales to Nations League B promotion, before helping to mastermind their Euro 2025 play-off success, firstly with a hard-fought play-off semi-final win over Slovakia. 

Wales were held to a 1-1 draw in the first leg of the play-off final by the Republic of Ireland but then recorded a stunning 2-1 win in Dublin to reach a major finals for the first time.

The 43-year-old especially showed her credentials in the Republic of Ireland matches, steering Wales past formidable foes despite being without Sophie Ingle and with star performer Jess Fishlock far from full fitness after returning from a calf tear.

Wilkinson seemed to successfully utilise mind games against then Ireland boss Eileen Gleeson, who got increasingly annoyed with comments made about her side.

"The only time I think about Rhian Wilkinson is when I get asked about her by you," she told journalists before the showdown in Dublin.

Ireland seemed agitated and on the edge in the final, Wales kept their cool and finally, are to play in a major tournament.

Destiny? Perhaps. But Wilkinson has changed women's football in Wales forever. Her legacy is already secure.

"When she speaks, it makes me want to run through a brick wall for her," said Wales defender Rhiannon Roberts.

"Our manager Rhian Wilkinson is one of the key reasons why we are where we are," defender Josie Green wrote in her BBC column.

"I have found Rhian absolutely fantastic to work with. I sit in some of her meetings and she delivers the messages and I think 'wow, that is such an impassioned and empowered speech'.

"That is what you want as a player, a coach that inspires you, who motivates you and who pushes you on and also makes you feel valued as a member of the group. Rhian has had a massive impact in the 15 months she has been our manager, we have a lot of belief in her."

Wales' most capped player, Fishlock believes Wilkinson has given Wales better squad depth than they have ever had.

"What I love about her is she loves to rotate and give opportunities," said Fishlock. 

"The depth of our squad is going to be our secret weapon. But also, I don't think we get the depth without her. She's the first manager who has given those opportunities.

"She came in and she said, this is what I'm doing. I don't care if I upset you off. I don't care if I cause trouble. This is what I'm doing because I believe. She had the long vision. The long, long, long vision. And I don't think we get here without that vision."

It has been recently reported that A series of free GP-led online sessions are being held for people in Surrey to learn about women's health conditions.

The next webinar will take place on Tuesday evening and will discuss polycystic ovary syndrome, premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder.

Later this year, there will be three further meetings to discuss endometriosis, fertility, cervical screening and menopause.

Vicky Williams, associate director for women and children at Surrey Heartlands Intergrated Care System, said she hoped the sessions would raise awareness around the conditions.

"We are really excited to be able to provide these free informative sessions for members of the public to help inform on conditions that affect the lives of many of us every day," she said.

The following webinars are planned for the coming months:

The webinars are open to all and are run by a GP, who will also answer questions.

People can sign up to the event via the trust's website.

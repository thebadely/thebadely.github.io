Let's dive into the details: Both Savinho (left) and Nico O'Reilly made their debuts for Manchester City last season

Midfielder Nico O'Reilly has signed a new contract at Manchester City until 2030 and the club are close to agreeing a new long-term deal with winger Savinho.

City's injury crisis last season allowed 20-year-old O'Reilly to break through into the first team, with the majority of his 21 appearances coming at the unfamiliar position of left-back.

He has featured in six of City's game so far this season and the new deal has the option of being extended for a further years.

âThis is a day I will never forget," said O'Reilly. "I have been at City since the age of eight, and to have made it into the first team and have played matches is a dream come true. To be rewarded with a new contract really is special.

âI am really proud and so is my mum! She has sacrificed so much to get me to where I am today, so I am just as happy for her as I am for myself. 

"But in truth, this is just the beginning for me. I have come so far, but I want to keep pushing now, improving every day, and become the best player I can be."

Savinho, 21, joined from French side Troyes for Â£30.8m in 2024, playing 48 games in all competitions and scoring three goals.

During the summer, Tottenham had opened talks to sign Savinho, but City sources said they were not looking to sell the player.

The Brazil international has made four appearances this season, scoring in Wednesday's 2-0 Carabao Cup win at Huddersfield.

Speaking before City's Premier League game against Burnley on Saturday, boss Pep Guardiola said Savinho will become an important player once he improves on his output.

"For the people up front, it is always about numbers - goals and assists," he added. "Savinho created a lot last season but in the final third, the final moment he was a little bit too hectic.

"But the moment he learns that, because he is so young, the more he improves, he will be a top-class player because he can play on both sides, he has got the speed and the work ethic.

"Savio will make this step, naturally it will come and he will be a top player for Man City."

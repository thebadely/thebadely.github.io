It has been recently reported that Campbell Hatton (left) retired from boxing earlier this year

Ricky Hatton's son Campbell said "heartbroken isn't the word" as he paid an emotional tribute to his father.

Former world champion Hatton was found dead in his home in Hyde, Greater Manchester, on Sunday.

Police said there were not believed to be any suspicious circumstances surrounding the 46-year-old's death.

In his first public comment since, Campbell posted a series of photographs on Instagram on Tuesday and said: "Heartbroken isn't the word.

"Everybody has always said I was your double - never a truer word said. Looked up to you in every aspect of life.

"Can't explain how much I'm going to miss the laughs we had and all the good times, which I will remember forever. Just can't believe we won't have any more. Love you, Dad."

Ricky Hatton won 45 of his 48 professional bouts during a 15-year boxing career, and was world champion at light-welterweight and welterweight. He last fought professionally in 2012, though had planned to return to the ring in October.

Nicknamed 'the Hitman', Hatton established himself as a hugely popular fighter with character inside and outside the ring - an estimated 30,000 fans travelled to watch his title fight against the great Floyd Mayweather in Las Vegas in 2007.

Campbell was also a professional boxer and won his first 14 professional fights. He retired earlier this year.

Hatton's family issued a statement on Monday in which they spoke of the outpouring of love and support towards him.

"He had a heart as big as his smile, and his kindness, humour and loyalty touched everyone who was lucky enough to know him," it said.

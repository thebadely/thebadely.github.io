Let's dive into the details: Scott Carson won four England caps between 2006 and 2011

After six trophy-laden years and only two appearances, goalkeeper Scott Carson will leave Manchester City when his contract expires this summer.

The 39-year-old former England international was part of a City squad that won 11 trophies, including the Treble in 2022-23.

Carson joined on loan from Derby County in 2019 before completing a free transfer in 2021.

He spent much of his time at City as third-choice keeper behind Ederson and Stefan Ortega, playing only 117 minutes in total.

While on loan, he saved a penalty in a 4-3 Premier League win over Newcastle United in May 2021.

He came on as a late substitute in a Champions League last-16 second leg draw with Sporting Lisbon in March 2022.

City said in a statement: "During his time at City, Carson has been praised by goalkeeping coach Xabi Mancisidor and peers Ederson and Stefan Ortega Moreno for his work ethic and the effect of his positive attitude amongst the group."

Last month former City team-mate Kyle Walker, who joined AC Milan on loan in January, said: "To come in every day knowing you're the third-choice keeper - mentally, I have to take my hat off to him.

"He's had a fantastic career but to still have the love for football and do what he does, these are the people you need around the place."

Carson has played for 10 teams since making his professional debut for Leeds United in 2004, including two years in Turkey with Bursaspor.

He was at Liverpool when the Reds won the Champions League, FA Cup and Super Cup, and was a member of the City squad that achieved four Premier League titles, one Champions League, an FA Cup, two League Cups, one Community Shield, one Super Cup and a Club World Cup.

Let's dive into the details: Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani has been injured in a car accident in the US state of New Hampshire.

Giuliani was a passenger in a Ford Bronco when it was struck from behind in the city of Manchester on Saturday evening, according to local police.

"He was diagnosed with a fractured thoracic vertebrae, multiple lacerations and contusions, as well as injuries to his left arm and lower leg," a statement from his security guard, Michael Ragusa, said. 

Giuliani, 81, became known as "America's Mayor" after leading New York through 9/11. He later became an adviser and then personal lawyer to Donald Trump, though the two have since parted ways.

All involved in the crash suffered non-life threatening injuries and were taken to hospital, police said. 

The incident happened shortly after Giuliani had helped an alleged victim of domestic violence who had flagged him down on a road, Mr Ragusa's statement added.

"Mayor Giuliani immediately rendered assistance and contacted 911," he said. 

New Hampshire police confirmed officers were investigating a reported domestic violence incident when they saw the crash on the opposite side of the road.

"As a result of the collision, both vehicles went into the median and were heavily damaged," police added.

Investigators said they have identified the driver who allegedly struck Giuliani's car, although no charges have been filed and the crash is under investigation.

First elected New York City mayor in 1993, Giuliani was in charge at the time of the 11 September attack on the World Trade Center in 2001. 

In 2008, he made an unsuccessful run for US president, and later became one of Trump's advisers during the latter's 2016 campaign. He joined Trump's personal legal team in 2018 and remained a part of it through to the 2020 election.

In the aftermath of Joe Biden's 2020 election victory over Trump, Giuliani spread baseless claims the election was stolen.

Earlier this year, he reached a tentative settlement with two former election workers who won $148m (Â£120m) in damages after they successfully sued him for defamation over false election fraud claims.

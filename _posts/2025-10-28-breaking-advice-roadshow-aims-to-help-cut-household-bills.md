Hereâ€™s what you need to know: People living in part of Norfolk are being offered help to reduce their bills and increase their incomes ahead of winter. 

King's Lynn & West Norfolk Borough Council is running "Beat the Bills Roadshow"  events across the district, including in Hunstanton, Downham Market and Dersingham.

The aim is to try to tackle money worries before they become so serious people lose their homes or are tempted to use an illegal money lender. 

People at the session at Hunstanton's Helping Hands Cafe shared their worries about rising energy bills and food costs. 

Hillary Letch, a pensioner from Hunstanton, said she was "worried" about how she could pay her bills this winter after the death of her husband. 

"I've gone from having a significant income from him to much less and the bills are all the same," she said. 

Mrs Letch said she was trying to reduce her costs by cutting down on how often she took her dog to the groomers and went out to eat with friends. 

She was one of those getting advice from the council's Lily Project.

Its aim was to build community and support people to have healthier independent lives.

The project's Rebekah Bensley-Mills said: "It's connecting people to advice for things like debt then looking at benefits, heating bills, water bills and how they are heating their house as well." 

Energy-efficient light bulbs, reflective radiator panels and low-flow shower heads were being given out to visitors. 

Richard Carter lives with his wife in Hunstanton and came to the Beat the Bills event looking for guidance on energy bills. 

He said he was trying to cut back on how much gas and electricity he used but was frustrated by standing charges increasing in recent years.

"The thing that's got me is Ofgem saying they [energy companies] can increase the standing charges," he said. 

"If they do that what was the point in trying to save electricity?"

Ofgem said it was planning to introduce a new, lower standing charge by the end of January, but energy bills were unlikely to drop as a result.

The council said it expected to reach hundreds of people through its roadshows.

Jo Rust, cabinet member for people and communities, said: "People often respond to money problems in one of two ways. 

"They either avoid the problem altogether or they panic and go for a short-term solution like giving up their home or going to a moneylender.

"But it doesn't have to be like that, and the council's main message is talk to us before doing anything else we can help".

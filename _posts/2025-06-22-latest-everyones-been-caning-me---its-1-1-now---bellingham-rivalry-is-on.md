According to new developments, Jude Bellingham has scored 38 goals and created 27 assists for Real Madrid since he joined the club in summer 2023

"Everyone was caning me yesterday saying he's better than me so I had to do something today."

A day after Jobe Bellingham scored his first goal for Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund at the Club World Cup, older brother Jude inspired Real Madrid with a strike of his own.

With Real down to 10 men against Mexican side Pachuca, Bellingham - that's Jude - broke the deadlock by controlling a pass, darting into the box and drilling a shot into the far corner.

The goal settled a nervy Real who ultimately won 3-1 to hand new manager Xabi Alonso his first win in charge.

It marks the first time the Bellingham brothers have scored in the same competition. It's also the first time two siblings have scored at the same Club World Cup.

The pair, who have a combined value of Â£164m according to TransferMarkt.com - the most of any pair of brothers currently playing - could meet each other as early as the quarter-final stage of this summer's competition.

That'll happen if both Real Madrid and Dortmund win their groups and get through their last-16 ties.

But, whether the duo end up facing each other or not, Jude Bellingham is already keeping his own personal score.

"We're 1-1 now and we'll see for the rest of the tournament," the England midfielder joked to DAZN.

Bellingham also confirmed he will undergo surgery to address a long-standing shoulder issue after the tournament.

The 21-year-old, who has been managing the injury since 2023, said: "I've reached the point where the pain isn't so bad, but I was sick of playing with the sling.

"I'm losing a lot of weight from sweating so much, and I've decided that I'll have surgery after the tournament. I've been waiting for a long time, and my patience is running out, but the physios and doctors have been incredible. I just want to feel free."

Bellingham scores as 10-man Real beat Pachuca

Jude Bellingham presents a tactical conundrum for new manager Xabi Alonso.

In his first season at Real Madrid he was fantastic, scoring 23 goals in 42 games while playing in an advanced midfield role to help Real Madrid to the 2023-24 La Liga and Champions League titles.

Last term he was pushed deeper and wider to accommodate Kylian Mbappe and only managed 14 strikes in 53 games as Real failed to win a major trophy.

At Alonso's unveiling as Real manager he said he saw Bellingham more as a central midfielder and that's where he started against Pachuca on Sunday - in the central left position of a 4-3-3.

But, when Raul Asencio was sent off after seven minutes, Madrid switched to a 4-4-1 with Bellingham playing even more centrally and driving from deep.

Two minutes after the tactics were tweaked during a first-half drinks break Bellingham made a late run into the box, picked up the ball from Fran Garcia and smashed a shot into the bottom corner.

It was 10-man Madrid's first meaningful attack and changed the entire momentum of the match.

"When Bellingham comes from deep and arrives, he is phenomenal. That is an amazing goal and that is where he plays best," former Italy striker Christian Vieri told DAZN.

"Alonso is the coach, he has to find a way to make them play. Bellingham scored so many goals before Mbappe arrived.

"It's not our problem, it is Alonso's problem and he is going to be having sleepless nights."

Ex-Chelsea midfielder Jon-Obi Mikel added: "That is where Bellingham is best, when he arrives late from midfield.

"No one can stop Jude in that role because he has the power and energy, he can be very special when doing that."

One of Alonso's biggest problems this season - and one which former boss Carlo Ancelotti struggled to solve - will be keeping all his stars happy.

Mikel added: "You have to play the players in their best positions because big players want to play in their best positions and that is the problem Xabi Alonso is going to have.

"We know Mbappe wants to play out on the left but they have one of the best players there in Vinicius Jr so where do you play him? He doesn't like playing through the middle.

"It is a massive problem for Xabi Alonso. If he can find a way to solve the problem then he may have a team. They need to play as a team not as individuals."

Real Madrid struggled defensively last season â as evidenced by their Â£50m purchase of Bournemouth centre-back Dean Huijsen and recruitment of right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold from Liverpool.

But the early signs are the issues are still there.

After a 1-1 draw against Al-Hilal in their tournament opener, Real were fortunate not to go behind against their Mexican opponents.

Pachuca had 25 shots, the most Real Madrid have faced in a 90-minute game since 2014. That is 38 shots faced in Alonso's first two games in charge.

They struggled at times to deal with 35-year-old former Everton striker Salomon Rondon â and let him race through on goal after a failure of the offside trap before Asencio needlessly hauled him down for the early red card.

Aurelien Tchouameni, who is a midfielder by trade, ended up moving to centre-back with Asencio gone, with goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois making 10 saves over the 90 minutes.

Asencio's Club World Cup is turning into something of a nightmare, having made the error that resulted in Al-Hilal's equaliser a few days previous.

"Raul Asencio needs to learn from experiences, he is still young and we will talk," said Alonso.

"We are so happy we have Thibaut in goal. He is so reliable when we had to be one player less defensively, but we defended with a lot of sacrifice and waited for our chances."

Alexander-Arnold had a steady game again, having a hand in Real's second goal, but was caught out of position at times â including a time when Pachuca broke from his corner-kick.

His three crosses were the most of any Real player, while he won two of his four duels.

Former Juventus and Lazio striker Vieri was full of praise for the England full-back.

"Trent is one of the best in the world, in two months everyone will be saying Real have the best player," he said.

"At Real Madrid they don't care about defending, they want to see you attack."

While ex-Chelsea midfielder Mikel added: "What Trent gives you is absolutely brilliant. The only question is his defending. I am sure Alonso will help him with that. Going forward, what he gives is fantastic."

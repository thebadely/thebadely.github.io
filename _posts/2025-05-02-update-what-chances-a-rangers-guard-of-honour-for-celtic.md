Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Barry Ferguson's side won the last Old Firm derby, but Brendan Rodgers' team have won the title

The thorny question of a guard of honour for the newly crowned champions is raised whenever the Scottish title is decided the game before the final Old Firm derby of the season.

The idea of congratulating your fiercest, city rivals in such circumstances has been anathema to many down the years, the only difference being the protagonists in the dugout and on the pitch.

Such is the case this season after Celtic secured the title last weekend after their 5-0 thrashing of Dundee United before travelling across Glasgow to face second-top Rangers on Sunday.

Whether or not a guard of honour is something that truly vexes the clubs or their fans, or is just a media construct, the question always comes up at pre-match press conferences. 

So what are the thoughts of current managers Brendan Rodgers and Barry Ferguson on the issue?

Celtic midfielder Luke McCowan on Thursday admitted he was not expecting a guard of honour at Ibrox, adding: "I don't know how it would be if it was on the other foot and I don't think we'll ever know".

His manager points out that "it's not in the rules" that you have to give one.

"I think that, when two clubs in the rivalry are so emotional, it's always difficult for the team that comes up short," Rodgers said. "I'm relaxed either way on it."

Despite that and while admitting he is "a little bit of a traditionalist", he laments the loss of "traditions of the great managers" the country has had.

"I always think, if you're a champion to show, or not a champion, showing that humility to the other team, whatever the rivalry is, it's a mark of respect," he said.

"But, like I said, Celtic-Rangers, it's an emotional rivalry and, if you're up short and if you come up short quite a lot, then it can be a challenge for you and to justify that with your supporters."

Barry Ferguson has been on both sides of the title celebrations, both as a Rangers player and now as interim head coach.

"I don't know why there's always a big clamour about a guard of honour," he said.

"It's never happened in the past, whether it's Celtic, whether it's Rangers, and I think it will always just remain that way."

As for the lack of a guard of honour, Ferguson adds: "It wouldn't bother me and, to be honest, I don't think it will bother Celtic."

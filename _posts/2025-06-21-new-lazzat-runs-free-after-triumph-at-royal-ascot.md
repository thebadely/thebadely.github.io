It has been recently reported that James Doyle was unshipped by Lazzat after the finishing line

French runner Lazzat ran free down the track after holding off Satono Reve to deny Japan a first triumph at Royal Ascot.

James Doyle was victorious aboard the 9-2 winner, trained by Jerome Reynier.

The jockey and winning owners Wathnan Racing, who also had the third-placed horse Flora Of Bermuda, were celebrating a double on the day after the earlier victory of Humidity in the Chesham Stakes.

Favourite Satono Reve was bidding to become the first Japanese-trained winner at the meeting after 12 previous attempts but was beaten by half a length.

As Doyle celebrated after the line, Lazzat unshipped his jockey and ran loose around the Ascot course before being caught.

Reynier was happier with Doyle than fellow jockey Flavien Prat, having described his effort on Facteur Cheval, external - who faded to finish sixth in Wednesday's Prince of Wales's Stakes - as "perhaps the worst ride given to one of my horses".

"James knew he was never going to get beaten. He listened exactly to what we said to him," said the trainer.

"He's a funny character, that is why he is Lazzat and he is our champion."

The 28-1 chance Get It, trained by George Baker,  just landed the Wokingham Handicap as 52-year-old jockey Seamie Heffernan edged out fast-finishing favourite More Thunder.

Rebel's Romance won the Hardwicke Stakes to give Godolphin trainer Charlie Appleby his first victory at Royal Ascot since 2022.

It was an eighth top-level Group One victory for the horse, ridden by William Buick.

"He was the horse we needed. I'm just glad to get one on the board in the end," said Appleby.

Appleby's 6-4 favourite Treanmor had earlier finished fifth behind Humidity and Rebel's Romance was his last Ascot runner of the week.

Oisin Murphy got up on the line with Quai De Bethune in the Golden Gates Stakes to beat Seraph Gabriel and deliver trainer Andrew Balding a Saturday double.

Murphy's fifth victory put him second behind the week's leading jockey Ryan Moore.

Moore claimed his seventh triumph on 4-5 favourite Sober - trained by Willie Mullins - who is likely to head to the Melbourne Cup in November after landing the Queen Alexandra Stakes. 

John and Thady Gosden were the leading trainers, with five wins, just beating Aidan O'Brien on second places.

A total of 286,541 spectators attended over the five days, an increase of 13,000 on 2024.

Rebel's Romance clocked up the 18th win of his career

The globetrotting Rebel's Romance added Royal Ascot to an impressive CV which has brought big victories in the United States, Dubai and Hong Kong.

At seven years old, he is oldest winner of the race for more than a century and adds to career earnings of more than Â£10m.

"We had one shot, one roll of the the dice left and what a partner. He's a dream horse - I'm blessed," said Buick.

"We gel together - he's my best friend."

The 6-4 favourite finished clear of Al Riffa with third place going to Ghostwriter, who was bought by Kia Joorabchian's Amo Racing for Â£2m this week.

In a week when temperatures reached 30C, Humidity was an aptly named winner of the Chesham Stakes.

The 4-1 shot, under James Doyle for trainer Andrew Balding, provided a fourth winner of the week for owners Wathnan Racing.

A brother of 2022 victor Holloway Boy, Humidity was bought by the Emir of Qatar's Wathnan team following a winning Newbury debut in the Cheveley Park Stud colours.

Jockey Kieran Shoemark and trainer Ed Walker celebrated a second victory at the 2025 meeting as 25-1 chance Noble Champion won the Jersey Stakes.

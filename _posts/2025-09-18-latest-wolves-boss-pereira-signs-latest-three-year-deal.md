Here’s what you need to know: Vitor Pereira managed four clubs in four years before taking charge of Wolves

Wolves manager Vitor Pereira has signed a new three-year contract at Molineux. 

Pereira guided the West Midlands club to the safety of a 16th-place finish last season after arriving in December 2024 with Wolves 19th in the Premier League. 

The 57-year-old's previous deal had been set to expire in the summer of 2026.

Wolves sit bottom of the table after losing their opening four league matches.

Chairman Jeff Shi said: "Vitor has made a very positive impact during his time at Wolves. He's brought clarity, energy and a team spirit that gives us a foundation to be successful.

"Now is a time for stability. Vitor needs time to work with the squad, to build a chemistry with new players, and we will do everything to support him and his staff."

Wolves lost several key players in the summer with Matheus Cunha moving to Manchester United for Â£62.5m, while Rayan Ait-Nouri went to Manchester City for Â£31m, and Nelson Semedo departed for Fenerbahce.

Speculation over the future of their Norway striker Jorgen Strand Larsen also proved an unwelcome distraction during Wolves' difficult start to the campaign, with the Portuguese coach also trying to bed in five new recruits. 

"We will increase our level, with [the] ambition to make our supporters proud on the pitch," said Pereira. 

"I'm very proud to be Wolves head coach. It's an honour for me. This is the moment that we need to be united."

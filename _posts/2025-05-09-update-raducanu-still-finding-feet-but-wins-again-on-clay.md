It has been recently reported that Emma Raducanu had never won a match at the Italian Open until this week

Emma Raducanu demonstrated her growing confidence on a clay court with a commanding Italian Open second-round win over Swiss lucky loser Jil Teichmann.

British number two Raducanu, who only knew she was facing Teichmann a few hours before the match, progressed with a clinical 6-2 6-2 win.

After earning her first win on outdoor clay in almost three years at the Madrid Open, she has now won back-to-back matches in Rome.

It is the first time Raducanu has reached the last 32 in the Italian capital - although tougher tests than 94th-ranked Teichmann await.

"I still don't feel really comfortable [on clay]," the 22-year-old English player told Sky Sports.

"I guess in a way it helps I have to be super focused on every single point, get my feet right and try not to fall over.

"I think I'm slowly finding my feet."

Raducanu was due to face 20th-ranked Ekaterina Alexandrova, but the Russian withdrew through injury on Friday morning.

Instead Raducanu found out in her warm-up she would be playing Teichmann, a left-hander who had lost in qualifying.

Teichmann, 27, has been as high as 21st in the world rankings and is adept on a surface which comes more naturally to her than Raducanu.

"She is a leftie and it's a completely different challenge. I hadn't played a leftie since February," Raducanu said.

"I spent the first few games adjusting to the way the ball curls, but I'm so proud of how I fought through."

Raducanu will play Russia's Veronika Kudermetova, ranked 50th in the world, in the third round.

The 2021 US Open champion has spoken about using the European clay court season, which culminates with the upcoming French Open, to finetune her game with the help of coach Mark Petchey.

Playing more aggressively on the slower surface - and taking greater control of points - has been the aim.

Clay is often about hanging tough in the longer, very physical rallies, but the pace and depth in Raducanu's returning game ensured she was not dragged into a lengthy scrap by Teichmann.

Raducanu, now ranked back inside the top 50, showcased her ability to dominate from the baseline.

Regularly stepping into the court and hitting returns earlier allowed the world number 49 to beat Teichmann with powerful winners.

Raducanu's service game, which she struggled with at the start of the season, was also commanding. 

Having lengthened the takeback in a bid to find more fluidity with her opening shot,  Raducanu did not lose serve and won 73% of her first-serve points.

That featured five aces - including the one which clinched victory on her fourth match point.

"After Miami I made some tweaks - it's a completely different motion, more fluid, a bit longer and hopefully more robust under pressure," she explained.

"It's by no means the finished product but there is room to grow it."

Raducanu is the only British player left in the women's singles draw after Sonay Kartal lost 6-4 6-2 to Czech 30th seed Linda Noskova.

Seeded players Aryna Sabalenka, Coco Gauff, Emma Navarro, Elena Rybakina, Zheng Qinwen and Mirra Andreeva all safely progressed.

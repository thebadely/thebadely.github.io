According to new developments, England reached the final in all five Women's Rugby World Cups Emily Scarratt played in

England great Emily Scarratt has announced her retirement after winning the second World Cup of her career last month.

An 11-time Six Nations champion and World Player of the Year in 2019, Scarratt is England women's all-time leading scorer with 754 points.

Centre Scarratt, 35, said playing for her country was "the greatest privilege", while Red Roses head coach John Mitchell described her as "a once in a generation player".

Earlier this year she became the first England player, male or female, to play at five Rugby World Cups.

"Rugby has given me everything; incredible team-mates, memories, and experiences I'll carry with me forever," Scarratt said.

Scarratt will continue coaching at Premiership Women's Rugby club Loughborough Lightning, but will also work for the Rugby Football Union in a specialist coaching and mentoring role.

"While it's the right moment to stop playing, I'm really excited to stay involved with the RFU and to help shape the future of the game," she added.

"The women's game is in an amazing place, and I'm proud to still be part of its journey."

RFU chief executive Bill Sweeney said: "Emily's contribution to English rugby cannot be overstated - on and off the field she has been a model professional, a leader, and a role model for thousands of girls who have picked up the ball because of her."

Having made her international debut in 2008, the last of Scarratt's 119 caps came in the opening match of the Rugby World Cup in Sunderland, when she came off the bench. She had been expected to feature later in the tournament but picked up a shoulder injury.

She went on to support the squad throughout the tournament in a variety of off-field roles,, external earning yet more fans for her humility and dedication to the squad.

Making it to her fifth Rugby World Cup was a huge achievement for Scarratt, who spent 13 months on the sidelines following a serious neck injury that required surgery in 2023.

She is considered to be one of the sport's greatest players, and delivered a stellar performance in the 2014 Rugby World Cup final, scoring 16 of England's 21 points as they beat Canada in Paris.

Scarratt also captained the Team GB Sevens team at the Rio Olympics in 2016.

Even when she was not on the pitch Scarratt played an influential role

There is little in the sport that Emily Scarratt hasn't achieved, her trophy cabinet allowing just enough room for a second World Cup medal. 

Raised in rural Leicestershire, she turned down a basketball scholarship to focus on rugby union. 

She has enjoyed an international career defined by silky running lines and kicking prowess, with the 2014 World Cup final arguably her crowning moment.

Affectionately known as 'Scaz', she has long avoided the spotlight despite growing media work - where her charm comes to the fore. 

Fans were frequently found clutching bags of croissants as gifts for her at games, after she once mentioned on her podcast she likes them. 

Scarratt's true legacy now lies in inspiring the next generation but, for many, she will be considered one of the greatest to have worn the England shirt.

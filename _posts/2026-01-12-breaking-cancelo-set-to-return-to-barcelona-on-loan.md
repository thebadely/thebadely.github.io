According to new developments, Joao Cancelo spent the 2023-24 season on loan with Barcelona from Man City

Former Manchester City defender Joao Cancelo is set to return to Barcelona on loan from Al-Hilal until the end of the season.

The 31-year-old passed a medical at Barca on Monday and is set to officially be announced on Tuesday.

Cancelo spent the 2023-24 season on loan from City with Barcelona, having spent the previous six months with German side Bayern Munich.

In his first spell with Barcelona, he made 42 appearances across all competitions, scoring four goals and setting up five more. 

The following season, he permanently left Pep Guardiola's City side in a Â£21.2m move to Saudi Pro League club Al-Hilal.

But after just one full campaign, the Portugal full-back is set to return to Europe having made just two league appearances for Al-Hilal this season.

Barcelona play Racing de Santander in the Copa del Rey on Thursday, before visiting Real Sociedad in La Liga on Sunday.

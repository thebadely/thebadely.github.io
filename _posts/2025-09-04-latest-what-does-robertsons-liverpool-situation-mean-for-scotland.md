It has been recently reported that Andy Robertson has been Steve Clarkeâs captain throughout his tenure

Being named Liverpool vice-captain isn't the only new role for Scotland left-back Andy Robertson this season following a self-confessed "difficult summer".

Following Milos Kerkez's arrival from Bournemouth, the national team captain appears to have slipped to second choice at Anfield for the first time since signing for the Reds eight years ago.

With just 30 Premier League minutes under his belt this term, the 31-year-old might be lacking a little in match sharpness for World Cup qualifying double header against Denmark and Belarus - live across the BBC.

"I've missed the feeling of playing games," Robertson told BBC Scotland. "I'm used to being a regular starter for so many years and it's been a bit difficult with the transition but I think I've dealt with it fairly well."

A concern for national team head coach Steve Clarke? Not yet, according to the man himself and former Everton and Scotland attacker and BBC pundit James McFadden, who insists "short term, there won't be too much of an issue".

But should Robertson's season include more sitting than starting, then Scotland and their captain may have a problem.

Scotland players 'deserve World Cup', says Clarke

You are Scotland boss Steve Clarkeâ¦ what would you do?

Is this first step of Clarke's last Scotland dance?

When Scotland last came together - for friendlies against Iceland and Liechtenstein in June - all the talk was about Robertson's future.

Liverpool's links to Kerkez were clear at that stage but where did that leave the two-time Premier League winner?

Some had tipped Robertson - who is in the final year of his contract - to leave Anfield, with a number of clubs reportedly, and understandably, interested. 

And yet despite 21-year-old Hungary international Kerkez making the Â£40m move on a five-year deal, Robertson has opted to stick around and fight for the position he's long had a stranglehold of.

"I had a think about what I wanted to do and I came to the decision, committed to the decision and I'm happy to be there," he added.

"We had options and we just worked through it as a family. 

"Everything boiled down to that my heart was still in Liverpool and we wanted to stay. We're very settled there and we're at one of the biggest clubs in the world."

So far, in the infancy of Arne Slot's side's title-defence, Robertson hasn't had much of a sniff, though.

Robertson on game time at Liverpool

Thirty minutes in Liverpool's season opener against Bournemouth on 15 August is all he's got, though Scotland head coach Clarke said his captain will still âplay more than enough footballâ as his club compete on four fronts.

But the lack of minutes come after a stickier campaign by his high standards, where more mistakes were made and just one assist in 33 league games was registered. 

That was far from the ridiculous numbers he and fellow full-back Trent Alexander-Arnold used to post under Jurgen Klopp, albeit the way they were asked to play under Slot was different.

Sporadically throughtout his international career, Robertson has been subject of frustration from some sections of the Scotland support, as he has at times struggled to replicate his cracking club form for his country.

He could hit double-figures on assists for Liverpool but could often then only find the Hampden stands with a cross on international duty.

If only it was so simple to suggest that form could flip in favour of Scotland, given Liverpool punters arenât currently enjoying the fruits of his labour.

Though not as straightforward as that, McFadden thinks there is a way Robertsonâs start to the season - or lack of - could benefit Clarkeâs team.

"It might actually work out because you've got somebody that wants to come in and hopefully remind everybody that he should be starting,â McFadden said.

"It's difficult. I've been there before where you're not playing regularly, but going away with Scotland gave me a lift because I knew there was a chance of playing and it was just something a wee bit different.â

Scotland supporters are desperate for something a wee bit different.

The loudest cry of the lot is to ditch the back three, which was introduced to accommodate Robertson and Kieran Tierney.

The Celtic full-back pulled out of this squad through injury, so it somewhat forces Clarkeâs hand into going with the four in defence.

It can be argued - in the same way the three was to suit Scotlandâs strength at left-back - a back four favours Scotlandâs rising stars. Most notably, Ben Gannon-Doak.

The Bournemouth wingerâs blistering pace is like few Scots before him, with McFadden - and many others - adding heâs âsomeone weâve been crying out forâ.

âHeâs a player that we don't see a lot of,â he added. âWe see a lot of wide men with speed, but he wants to get on the ball and he wants to take people on.

âWe need to get him in the team where he's best, and work out what's best to fit around about him.â

Naturally, that will come at a cost for some of Clarkeâs most trusted players. Those who have taken Scotland to back-to-back European championships. 

Robertson, though, backs himself to remain a part of Clarke's plans and continue his chase of Kenny Dalglish's record 102 caps. 

He's, of course, been in his fellow Liverpool hero's ear telling him: "I'm coming for you". 

"His reply was plenty of players have said that before and he's still the main man," Robertson revealed.

The left-back is still 18 appearances shy on the eve of what he knows is likely to be his last crack at qualifying for a World Cup.

An almighty return at Anfield may be required if he is to prove Dalglish wrong.

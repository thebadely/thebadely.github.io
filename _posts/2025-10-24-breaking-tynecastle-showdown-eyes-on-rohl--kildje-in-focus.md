Experts revealed that Danny Rohl, Derek McInnes, Brendan Rodgers and Thibault Klidje could make headlines this weekend

The most fascinating weekend of the Scottish Premiership season so far is upon us.

After three intriguing games are played out on Saturday, attention will turn to a top-of-the-table encounter at Tynecastle on Sunday lunchtime.

A league managerial debut at Ibrox and a Hibernian striker are also in our focus.

Here are our things to look out for...

No prizes for guessing this one. 

Our pick for game of the weekend could not be anywhere else as the Premiership's top two face off at Tynecastle with a five-point gap wedged between them.

Chat of a title challenge from Hearts is becoming more serious by the week, while Celtic appear to be on the verge of a crisis.

Defeat for Brendan Rodgers' men, who beat Sturm Graz on Thursday, would stretch open a scarcely-believable eight-point advantage for Derek McInnes' side.

The reigning champions are nowhere near their best, looking blunt in front of goal domestically amid continued protests aimed at the club's board from a disgruntled support.

The leaders have had a full week to prepare, while Celtic had to get a sweat on in midweek, so the visitors can surely expect an intense approach from the home side.

Rodgers last tasted defeat against Hearts in March 2024, which was a second straight loss to the Edinburgh club.

Since then, Celtic have swept aside their weekend opponents in their past four meetings with an aggregate score of 12-1.

Remember the clocks go back in the early hours of Sunday... you will not want to miss this.

Another easy pick as new Rangers boss Danny Rohl makes his Premiership bow at Ibrox.

The German's tenure got under way with a meek Europa League defeat at Brann.

Now attention turns to arresting the club's alarming league start. After eight games, Rangers are sixth with one win.

Kilmarnock, licking their wounds after a 3-0 home defeat by Hearts last Saturday, are the visitors to Ibrox.

Rangers are yet to win a home league game this season. Their last Premiership victory in Govan came in May last term under former interim boss Barry Ferguson.

No-one thinks Rohl is walking into an easy job, but he will still be required to hit the ground running in order to get the fanbase onside.

The best way to do that, clearly, is by winning games. Sound the cliche klaxon, but home matches against sides like Kilmarnock should be Rangers' bread and butter.

The Ayrshire club beat the Ibrox side 12 months ago at Rugby Park, but they have not won at Ibrox since 2018.

Has Thibault Klidje finally arrived at Hibs?

The Leith club's record signing, brought in from Luzern in the summer, made the most of a rare start against Livingston last Saturday.

The striker was a livewire in the Hibs attack, smashing in a clinical opener and winning a penalty as David Gray's side went on to record a 4-0 win.

Starting the Togo forward over Martin Boyle was viewed as a bold call from the head coach, but now he has a stick-or-twist decision to make this weekend.

Regardless of whether Boyle comes back in, it is fair to assume Hibs fans will want to see Klidje continue in attack when Gray's men visit Aberdeen on Sunday.

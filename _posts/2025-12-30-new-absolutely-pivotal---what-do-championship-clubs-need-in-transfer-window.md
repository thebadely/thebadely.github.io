Let's dive into the details: (Left to right) Kieran McKenna, Josh Sargent, Hayden Hackney, Abdul Fatawu and Frank Lampard

A window of opportunity or a frustrating distraction? 

Championship clubs will probably view January in many different ways as teams across Europe are able to buy, sell and loan players once again.

The transfer window can represent a chance to reinforce and retool a squad amid a challenging winter and with late-season ambitions in mind, or leave teams in a weaker position because of poor decision-making, inactivity or simply being at the mercy of those higher in football's food chain.

Whatever the consequence, every club in the second tier is likely to have a go at something or someone in some capacity before the window shuts on 3 February and the moment passes for another five months.

With promotion, play-offs, relegation and general pressure - whether at boardroom or supporter level - in mind, BBC Sport has asked correspondents covering the division's 24 teams what is desired from their respective clubs and whether any business is likely.

Coventry have maintained breathing space on the teams below them but the race for the second automatic promotion spot and play-offs is increasingly tight

Richard Wilford, BBC Radio WM

What do Birmingham need in order to realise their ambitions for the 2025-26 season?

After a summer window that was, at best, mixed, there are some glaring needs for Blues boss Chris Davies and the club's recruitment team to address.

A striker is essential with Kyogo Furuhashi having failed to score in the league and German forward Marvin Ducksch having only shown glimpses of his talent.

Defensive cover is needed right across the back four, but the priority there would be a left-sided centre-back.

What have previous January windows taught us about Birmingham and are they likely to make any signings in 2026?

With ambitious owners they will invest again, maybe to the tune of three or four new additions.

Last January, even when promotion seemed almost certain, they brought in Kieran Dowell from Rangers to help unlock League One defences. They also secured German defender Phil Neumann on a pre-contract agreement for this season. 

You can reasonably assume Blues will be active.

Is there any concern over specific players leaving and, if so, how could that have an impact on the window and the season itself?

There does not seem to be any likelihood of any key players leaving, most of them were lured in by the "project" as owners Knighthead like to describe it.

And while Championship wins have been harder to come by, especially away from home, that project is not going to be reset any time soon.

Some fringe players, however, will maybe want to move on to somewhere they can earn more minutes on the pitch, with loanees Lewis Koumas (Liverpool) and Eiran Cashin (Brighton) quite likely to be fished back and redeployed by their parent clubs.

How important is this window for Birmingham in terms of determining where they finish in May?

It is a highly significant window if the ambition is to challenge for the top six this season.

If they can add some goals up top and find a more consistent back four that would be a step forward - Blues have been too much of an easy touch on their travels. 

Some early business could give the side a bit of a kick-start.

Andy Bayes, BBC Lancashire

What do Blackburn need?

To strengthen the squad with potentially four or more new faces.

Valerien Ismael said prior to Christmas he wants to integrate new players into the squad before the FA Cup third-round visit to Hull City on 11 January. That could be a tall order, but we will have to wait and see.

I think they need two centre-backs, as they appear to be wedded to playing with three.

Ismael wants a right wing-back as Ryan Alebiosu is away with Nigeria at Afcon, and they definitely need more striking options with not a great deal of competition for Andri Gudjohnsen and Yuki Ohashi.

What have previous January windows taught us?

They have let deals slip through their fingers in two January windows.

American striker Duncan McGuire was not registered correctly on deadline day in 2024, with the same happening a year earlier with deadline day deals for Lewis O'Brien from Nottingham Forest and Ethan Brierley from Rochdale.

Last season they announced three deadline day arrivals with three others arriving earlier in the month.

I would suspect Ismael might have to wait a little longer than early January to make considerable changes.

Andri Gudjohnsen, Yuki Ohashi and Todd Cantwell have scored 17 of Blackburn's 22 goals this season

Is there any concern over specific players leaving?

Not really, no. Nobody is really being linked with moves away.

There will be some churn as Rovers have 24 players registered with one spot up for grabs.

Others will have to vacate their positions if Ismael gets to bring in as many players as he would like.

Clubs might be looking at left-back Harry Pickering's situation. He's started one league game all season and will be rightly frustrated by such a lack of game time.

How important is this window?

This is a huge month to come for Rovers. This time last year it was about whether they could strengthen their hold on a play-off spot.

This year, it's all about getting enough points to be in the Championship again next season. The squad needs help, and fast.

How much help they are given really remains to be seen. They weren't particularly keen on the loan market last summer. I wonder if that will change over the next few weeks?

Richard Hoskin, BBC Radio Bristol

What do Bristol City need?

Gerhard Struber said recently the league table would suggest his side are currently only a "good team" - and to become a "top team" they have to score more goals.

I think the majority of City fans would agree â and while the improved form of Sinclair Armstrong is encouraging, they will hope (and expect) to see another striker added to the squad to enhance their chances of emulating last season's top-six finish.

What have previous January windows taught us?

Fans were frustrated 12 months ago when City did not add to their squad significantly in January â as it turned out they had enough quality to reach the play-offs.

On this occasion I would expect some incomings â but realistically these could be loan signings, given the lack of funds available to Struber, or frees, with Sam Morsy expected through the door shortly.

It is worth pointing out the landscape could change if Antoine Semenyo leaves Bournemouth, given City are due a sell-on fee of any profit made from his sale in 2023. 

But, then again, the recently published losses of Â£18.6m will likely absorb most, if not all, of that.

Is there any concern over specific players leaving?

City have key players out of contract in the summer, so rival clubs will be monitoring Anis Mehmeti and Zak Vyner in particular.

Both are key members of the squad â Mehmeti for his goals and assists, Vyner for his experience and versatility. 

City have offered both new contracts, but the fact neither has put pen to paper yet is a concern.

How important is this window?

While they will be hoping for better luck with injuries heading into 2026 - I do not think it is too strong to say that a new striker, who is able to hit the ground running, could be the difference to City finishing in the play-offs, or just missing out.

The Championship is so tight and unpredictable that every point and every goal this season could be key to their end-of-season ambitions.

Paul Sullivan, Charlton commentator

What do Charlton need?

It's become abundantly clear Charlton need their best XI on the pitch and seven genuine impact players on the bench. 

They have been extremely unlucky to have the heart ripped out of their usually reliable defence with the absences of Josh Edwards, Amari'i Bell and Reece Burke. Further up the pitch, key forwards Matt Godden and Charlie Kelman have also been missing. 

To prevent these issues persisting, a measured foray into the January transfer market would be prudent.

What have previous January windows taught us?

This question can only really be answered with Nathan Jones in mind. This time last year, in his first January window at the helm, he brought in loan signings Alex Gilbert from Middlesbrough and Tom McIntyre from Bournemouth. 

Gilbert, in particular, made a valuable contribution in midfield to help secure play-off success and is now shining for Boro as they chase promotion.

Daniel Kanu has scored 12 goals in 22 appearances for Walsall

Is there any concern about specific players leaving?

There's been no indication of any major departures from The Valley, although as it stands, James Bree is due to return to parent club Southampton - a player Nathan Jones would love to sign permanently. 

There will inevitably be admiring glances from afar for centre-back Lloyd Jones, whose consistency and leadership are crucial. 

Most Charlton fans would agree that without him, the side could be in trouble, but I feel confident the club can match his ambitions - at least for now.

How important is this window?

Back in the summer, managing director James Rodwell indicated there would be limited activity this January, given the number of additions already made before the season began. 

However, the recent glut of injuries may prompt a rethink and force the owners to protect their Championship investment with a few astute additions, whether permanent or on loan.

Another consideration will be whether to recall forward Daniel Kanu, who is enjoying an excellent loan spell at Walsall and scoring freely in League Two.

Ideally, Charlton need a left-sided defender capable of playing both wing-back and centre-back, along with an energetic, ball-winning midfielder who brings physicality and drive. 

A target man to provide cover and competition for Miles Leaburn would also strengthen the squad's balance.

William Oelrich, BBC CWR

What do Coventry need?

It's been such a strong start for the Sky Blues that the January window feels more like fine-tuning than rebuilding.

The only clear gap is out wide, where I can see Frank Lampard targeting an extra winger, but beyond that I do not expect major business.

Injuries have already forced Coventry to lean on academy talent to fill the bench, and while those youngsters have stepped up admirably, a couple of smart loan additions could give the squad the depth it needs for the run-in.

What have previous January windows taught us?

I think the loan market will be absolutely pivotal in the January window. Any permanent signing - especially with one eye on a potential Premier League push - would need to be top tier and ready to step straight in, which naturally comes with a hefty price tag.

Last January's addition of Matt Grimes proved to be a masterstroke, but with Lampard already having had two windows to shape the team, it feels like the big spending has been done.

This time, smart, targeted loan deals might be the key to giving Coventry the depth they need to remain in the promotion spots.

Is there any concern over specific players leaving?

The Sky Blues do have a few fringe players who could head out on loan for valuable game time, but only if it benefits all parties - and only if replacements are lined up.

With the team flying, rumours are inevitable, yet January is an expensive market and meaningful deals rarely come cheap.

More importantly, this squad looks fully invested in the project, and the togetherness has been a huge part of their success so far.

For that reason, I'd be surprised to see any significant departures this window.

How important is this window?

With a solid squad in place already and players buying into the project, I think one or two loan players coming in to bolster the squad would be a good window and one which will help the club continue at the top of the league and hopefully finish in the top two come May.

Dominic Dietrich, BBC Radio Derby

What do Derby need?

Derby actively pursued extra options in centre midfield to compliment the additions of David Ozoh on loan and Lewis Travis for over Â£3m, and, as the season kicked into gear, it became apparent they might need a more progressive option in there despite the good form of Bobby Clark in recent weeks.

Left-back is a problem area in the squad as well. Owen Beck's loan from Liverpool was cut short without him playing a minute for the Rams due to a severe hamstring injury, so you would expect Derby to add some extra depth around Callum Elder and Craig Forsyth.

What have previous January windows taught us?

Derby ended up having a busy January last season with the high-profile departure of defender Eiran Cashin for over Â£10m which enabled a move for Norway international Sondre Langas and striker Lars Jorgen Salvesen.

Last season was fairly unique given the imminent sacking of Paul Warne at the end of January but as I understand it, there will not be lots of money available off the back of a summer that's seen them spend big fees on a number of players.

Jacob Widell Zetterstrom has kept four clean sheets this season

Is there any concern over specific players leaving?

I am not sure concern is the right word for Derby but players that could attract attention with some asset value include Jacob Widell Zetterstrom. The Rams goalkeeper has started the season well and, as a result, got himself back into the Sweden squad.

RB Salzburg loanee Clark will be one they want to keep at the club amid reports months ago in Scotland that Celtic could be interested, but any talk of that has died down since his emergence in holding midfield.

There could be departures for other members of the squad who have found themselves on the fringes, so it could be a case of shifting some pieces around to get others in.

How important is this window for Derby?

If Derby can make some savvy additions, use their loan spot well, it could be key in making that extra step from mid-table to top half/play-off contention. However, there is no rush at Pride Park.

The club have reiterated a number of times that this is a building season following a relegation fight last campaign. 

Fitness will ultimately decide where they end up, depth has been tested, so adding to that in January would help.

Mike White, BBC Radio Humberside

What do Hull need?

They only need minor tweaks/additions to the squad if they can keep most of their key players fit, but as the first few months have shown, that's a big 'if'.

They will have to move players on to do that though and winger David Akintola is high on that list having struggled to make his mark in the Championship.

There is also some thought Cody Drameh could leave as he seeks more game time than he is currently getting.

What have previous January windows taught us?

Two seasons ago they had a good go at trying to secure a play-off place (they finished seventh) bringing in the likes of Fabio Carvalho (who was going to be a target this time too before his ACL injury), while last January during a nervy relegation battle, it was Matt Crooks, John Egan, Kyle Joseph and the currently injured Eliot Matazo (ACL) who all made a mark in one way or another.

They are currently still under the second of their two-window transfer sanctions issued by the EFL, so can only get free agents or loans without a fee, and it's 'one in, one out'. But their summer activity showed they had the ability to still recruit strongly, so confidence should be high again.

Is there any concern over specific players leaving?

The biggest concern will be surrounding highly-rated defender Charlie Hughes, although the hope will be they can at least keep him around until the summer.

He is still only 22 but, with more than 120 senior career games under his belt already, is an established and experienced player with Premier League ambitions and no doubt Premier League admirers.

The owner himself has said he would not stand in his way if a top-flight club comes in but hopes Hughes would give the Tigers this full season before looking elsewhere.

For the right money though, they could be swayed. Of course, were City to get promoted that could see both sides find common ground but that's still a long way off as it stands.

How important is this window for Hull?

It is important in the sense that they have already had a half season of injuries to some key players, so everyone will be cautious about that and not wanting to find themselves shorthanded.

However, the squad needs tweaks, not an overhaul, as they are in a solid position and have performed well for the most part barring the odd ugly loss or 'game of two halves' efforts.

With Oli McBurnie, Liam Millar, Mo Belloumi plus Joseph finding some goalscoring form, and Joe Gelhardt set to return from a calf injury in mid to late January, they are certainly in the conversation to be a genuine contender when May rolls around.

Graeme McLoughlin, BBC Radio Suffolk

What do Ipswich need?

An additional striker to provide serious competition to George Hirst. Loanee Ivan Azon has managed a couple of goals but is still getting to grips with the Championship during his first spell in England.

Despite scoring for fun at Middlesbrough not so long ago, Chuba Akpom has managed just one goal in Town colours so far and tends to be played as a number 10.

Jaden Philogene has his own goal of the season competition going on at the moment, which has been wonderful to see, but it would be nice for Town to be guaranteed a few tap-ins between now and the end of the season as well.

What have previous January windows taught us?

When Town were last in the Championship they brought Kieffer Moore back to the club during the January window, and the Wales international played a significant role as Kieran McKenna's side won promotion to the Premier League.

During the previous January (2023), Hirst, Harry Clarke, Massimo Luongo and Nathan Broadhead were signed, and helped Town achieve promotion from League One.

In summary, the Blues have a very good and potentially unrivalled recent history in this window under their current owners.

George Hirst's six goals this season, in all competitions, has already matched his total from last term

Is there any concern over specific players leaving?

There are fears among some supporters that one of their favourite double-promotion winners, Wes Burns, may be tempted by a move away.

At the time of writing, he is yet to kick a ball in the Championship this season because of injury, but is now closing in on full fitness. 

However, Sindre Walle Egeli seems to have that position tied up, with Kasey McAteer and Jack Clarke able to play there as well.

Homegrown Harry Clarke is another who could potentially leave, given the competition for places at right-back, while another loan move may well be on the cards for midfielder Cameron Humphreys.

How important is this window?

Should Town get a striker who is ready to play and guaranteed to bring goals, it could well be the difference between a top-six finish or automatic promotion.

Owynn Palmer-Atkin, BBC Radio Leicester

What do Leicester need?

It is clear they are in need of firepower. Between the three senior strikers this season - Patson Daka, Jordan Ayew and Julian Carranza - they have managed just five goals in a combined 50 appearances.

That is not the level required to get you back into the Premier Leagueâ¦ perhaps an imminent arrival in Michail Antonio might help that cause.

What have previous January windows taught us?

That speed will take a back seat. Leicester have showcased in previous windows they will not rush and they will not pay over the odds either.

You wonder whether, given their current position, that might have to change.

Is there any concern over specific players leaving?

Leicester fans will have a nagging concern that Abdul Fatawu may well be tempted away.

They have good reason to as well - his power, pace and quality are all at Premier League level.

Throw in a goal from 70 yards out and the case becomes stronger. If the Foxes are to complete their goals, they need Fatawu in their squad.

How important is this window?

I would say it will play a significant part in the season. Leicester have some important work to do in this window with both incomings and outgoings to leave the squad in the best position for the final few months of the season.

If they can move on players who are not making an impact and replace them with quality that can, it will leave them in a much better position to kick on.

Mark Drury, BBC Radio Tees

What do Boro need?

To carry on in the same vein as in the first half of the season.

Boro's start to the season under Rob Edwards was outstanding and, to be frank, something of a surprise to the majority of the fanbase and within the club too.

Things had plateaued in the weeks before Edwards' surprising (and baffling) departure for Wolverhampton Wanderers, but Kim Hellberg's arrival reignited the campaign.

The Swede breathed new life into a misfiring attack, bringing Alex Gilbert and Alex Bangura in from the cold, while giving direction and clarity of purpose to strikers David Strelec and Tommy Conway.

What have previous January windows taught us?

The lesson of Januarys past is that if Boro are in with a genuine shot of promotion then owner Steve Gibson will back his manager to the hilt.

They are likely to revive their interest in Columbus Crew full-back Max Arfsten, having pursued him throughout the summer, and they will finally be able to play Adilson Malanda in central defence.

Malanda was signed from Charlotte FC last summer, but a condition of the deal was that he would be loaned back to the MLS side until the US season was finished.

With Boro's central defenders, Alfie Jones aside, proving worryingly injury prone, his presence will be a huge boost.

Also do not rule out Boro adding to their attack in an attempt to get over the line a decade after their last promotion.

Ten years ago, Championship goal machine Jordan Rhodes arrived at the Riverside Stadium in a deadline day move that then head coach Aitor Karanka described as "Steve arriving with a present".

Middlesbrough are winless in their past three matches after claiming four straight victories when Kim Hellberg took charge

Is there any concern over specific players leaving?

The obvious worry for Boro fans is the future of Hayden Hackney. His deal has just 18 months to run and there is no sign yet of an extension being signed.

That leaves Middlesbrough in a vulnerable position and they could perhaps be forced to consider a deal for one of their most important players if a suitably tempting offer arrives.

Boro accepted a Â£20m bid from Ipswich Town last summer before Hackney turned the move down after some serious thought.

If Hackney or any other big-name player leaves, fans will place their faith in head of football Kieran Scott and his recruitment team to plug the gap.

Scott told BBC Radio Tees Sport in September that lessons have been learned from the mistakes of last January when, in his words, "the coaching staff and the club weren't aligned" in their vision of the future.

It is safe to say Hellberg and the club are on the same page this time around.

How important is this window?

The same as for the rest of the division.

If they can go into February in a stronger position than they started the year then that's great, but the really important thing is not to leave January with a weaker squad than on New Year's Day as was the case last season.

They will be acutely aware of the need to avoid upsetting the balance of Hellberg's squad.

Chris Peddy, BBC Sport England, London & South East

What do Millwall need?

Millwall have continued their fine form from last season into the first half of this campaign under Alex Neil. They go into 2026 fifth in the league and broadly speaking the message will be to keep going.

Tuesday marks a year to the day since Neil took over at The Den and their total of 76 points in 2025 has only been bettered by Sheffield United (78), Middlesbrough (79) and league leaders Coventry (80), of the teams that have been in the Championship for the full calendar year.

One area the Lions could improve on is in front of goal - they have scored six fewer goals than any other team in the top six and are the only side with a negative goal difference in the play-off spots.

Their top scorer this season is winger Femi Azeez with six. Getting Mihailo Ivanovic scoring and Josh Coburn back from his long-standing quad injury in the new year would give them a huge boost in their race to make the play-offs.

What have previous January windows taught us?

Last January was a month of change at The Den following the arrival of Alex Neil to replace club legend Neil Harris in the dugout.

The Scotsman came in as rumours swirled about a move away for star player Romain Esse and the England Under-21 international promptly completed a permanent move to Crystal Palace.

The club made eight signings, including a flurry on the final day of the window, and showed their intent by breaking their then-transfer record to bring in Camiel Neghli.

Injuries could dictate how busy the next month is, with several absences meaning many players have played a lot of minutes and had to be versatile to plug the gaps.

Speaking to BBC Radio London after Millwall's win over Bristol City on Monday, Neil said he was hoping to have a few of those who have been unavailable back to full fitness in the new year.

Is there any concern over specific players leaving?

Unlike last year when the noise around a move for Esse would not go away, persistent rumours have not circulated around The Den this time round.

Azeez has put in some standout performances and Tristan Crama has been a star at the back, moving seamlessly between centre-back and right-back, but given the ongoing injury issues and the momentum the club has, you would expect to see more incomings to add depth, rather than outgoings.

Though as always, Lions fans will be aware of potential interest from any of the big spenders, having seen Japhet Tanganga depart for Sheffield United in the summer.

How important is this window?

The January window always presents challenges as well as opportunities, and Millwall's primary aim will be on the pitch and keeping up their momentum in search of a top-six finish.

If some of those who have been injured can get back fit and available, it will ease the need to bring new faces in at a level we saw last January.

Get to February in a strong league position and with a healthier squad, either by players returning from injury or a couple coming in through the door, and they will have navigated an often tricky month well.

Chris Goreham, BBC Radio Norfolk

What do Norwich need?

The plan was for this to be a play-off push but it has been clear since their rotten start to the campaign that the aim now is purely survival.

Left-back has been a particular issue - I make it eight different players have started at left-back or left wing-back this season.

They could certainly do with another winger, and it would be no surprise if head coach Philippe Clement wanted to find another option for the number 10 role which seems to be key to the way he wants to play.

What have previous January windows taught us?

The Canaries have spent more than Â£50m on signings since Ben Knapper became sporting director just over two years ago.

As they nosedived into the Championship relegation zone in the first part of this season, supporters were often calling his recruitment record into question. 

It will be Knapper, rather than Clement, who will be under scrutiny when the window opens again.

Josh Sargent has been with Norwich since 2021

Is there any concern over specific players leaving?

There is only one answer to this question - Josh Sargent, often described as 'the Championship's best striker' although his goals record might not suggest that this season.

He did not find the net at all between the end of August and December, but there was such a lack of creativity even Erling Haaland might have had problems.

The American has a place at a home World Cup to fight for in the summer and he will need a good second half of the season to earn his place in the squad.

He does have two-and-a-half years left on his contract so the Canaries will not let him go unless for a massive fee.

How important is this window?

It could be argued Norwich's best bit of business took place in between transfer windows. At the time of writing, Clement has improved results and completely changed the feeling around the club.

Most fans would like to think he has done enough to earn a say in which players are signed in January.

Liam Manning might wish he had been more vocal about the business done in the summer if he had his time again.

Jerome Sale, BBC Radio Oxford

What do Oxford need?

The ambition is to stay in the Championship and the search for consistency in results translates into a search for players who will deliver consistently.

Virtually everyone in the squad has made a significant contribution at some point, but for too many it has been too infrequently. 

The absence through injury of captain Cameron Brannagan has hurt them and even though he could be back in the new year, Oxford have seen enough to know they cannot continue without more cover - and ideally competition - in midfield.

What have previous January windows taught us?

The last January window was recently referenced by Gary Rowett before his dismissal - they brought in midfielder Alex Matos on loan from Chelsea (he is now at Sheffield United) and signed defender Michel Helik from Huddersfield Town.

They went for quality over quantity, and it got the job done, and they will do the same this time.

Is there any concern over specific players leaving?

United do want to trim their squad - three or four players have barely kicked a ball.

Given their position, they're unlikely to field a huge amount of calls on their players, but defender Jack Currie is one who could attract interest. He is just turning 24 and still has a high ceiling.

How important is this window?

The club will be keen to demonstrate their recruitment machine runs smoothly even with managerial change and that while some targets may be prioritised after input from the head coach, the strategy is unwavering. 

They are now recruiting for Rowett's replacement too and to have any chance of survival in the Championship, they need to be successful on both fronts.

Andrew Moon, BBC Radio Solent

What do Portsmouth need?

It would be quicker to list the positions Portsmouth definitely do not require any additions in rather than the ones they do. 

Ideally, they need two or three players capable of going straight into the starting XI and a few to come in and challenge for places. They also need their key players to stay fit.

What have previous January windows taught us?

For many years January was a tough month, most notably 2019 when the wrong strategy led to missing out on League One promotion by two points.

However, the past two Januarys have been good. Callum Lang arrived early in 2023 and remains a key player in the side. Rob Atkinson made a huge difference after arriving on loan last season. John Mousinho has openly talked about wanting up to six new faces.

John Mousinho is approaching his three-year anniversary at Portsmouth, making him the third longest-serving boss in the Championship

Is there any concern over specific players leaving?

There was rumoured interest in Josh Murphy in August but no club made a significant effort to buy him and he subsequently signed a new deal.

If he was to leave in January it would make life extremely tough. Portsmouth need to improve their squad and it will be very challenging to do that if they sell any key players.

How important is this window?

Absolutely crucial. It is tricky to see Pompey staying up if they have a bad January. The owners have reiterated wanting to sign young, hungry players who they can sell on in the future but this window demands players who can come in and make an immediate impact.

If you can do both then fantastic, but there's only so many players for the future you can have in a squad.

Andy Bayes, BBC Radio Lancashire

What do North End need?

A striker, I would imagine, will be a top priority. Milutin Osmajic is close to a return from a ban, but Paul Heckingbottom will want more in that area to provide competition for Daniel Jebbison, Osmajic and Michael Smith.

I would also say that another centre-back might be in the thinking if they can get one over the line.

What have previous January windows taught us?

Last January saw three new faces come in, two were on loan and one was Lewis Gibson who has been outstanding since his permanent arrival from Plymouth.

Gibson was announced on 3 January, so maybe they could follow that path and try to land one or two early, if they are available.

The previous season saw no fresh faces added in January and the year before that they landed strikers Tom Cannon and Liam Delap on loan deals from Premier League clubs. Cannon was the more successful of the two and really hit the ground running. 

The loan market will be key again.

Is there any concern over specific players leaving?

The big question is, with Everton's midfield issues, will they allow the hugely talented Harrison Armstrong to stay?

Everyone at Deepdale hopes so. He is a player with massive potential and could be a regular in the Everton side perhaps as early as this season.

Jamal Lewis' short-term deal also comes to an end this month. Heckingbottom is definitely open to him staying and you would expect a deal to be straightforward, probably for the remainder of the season.

How important is this window?

This is the time for North End to build on what they have created. It is easy to say that but finding the money to do it has always been the issue.

You get the sense that something special is happening at Deepdale and with a little more work to beef up the squad with quality, who knows where it could take them?

David McIntyre, BBC Sport England

What do QPR need? 

To remain a solid Championship side and maintain their encouraging season so far -  probably nothing. 

That's a change - and a significant sign of progress - for a club that seemed perpetually stuck in a cycle of spending badly and therefore seeing every transfer window as even more important than the previous oh-so-important one. 

For once, no major surgery is needed. In Richard Kone and top scorer Rumarn Burrell, they also have not one but two strikers capable of finding the net. 

To have a real crack at the play-offs, though, Rangers probably need a goalkeeper, as well as a dynamic midfielder capable of playing in the number eight role. 

Paul Nardi was replaced in goal by Joe Walsh, who did not seem ready for the step up and then suffered a broken wrist. 

That enabled Nardi to regain his place, only for him to perform so poorly he lost it again, this time to 37-year-old Ben Hamer, who had not played for 18 months.

Ronnie Edwards made 22 appearances for QPR on loan last season; he has not started for Southampton since 1 November 

What have previous January windows taught us?

Generally that Rangers have spent years papering over cracks and not doing so very convincingly. 

That said, Ronnie Edwards came in on loan from Southampton last year and was a big hit. Many fans would like to see him return.

Is there any concern over specific players leaving?

Not really. Burrell has been a revelation but is probably not yet at the stage where he is likely to attract big offers. Sheffield United recalling on-loan left-back Rhys Norrington-Davies would leave a void to fill, however. 

How important is this window?

Again, not as crucial as previous windows - a position QPR have spent more than a decade trying to reach.

Andy Giddings, BBC Radio Sheffield

What do Sheffield United need?

The Blades need to strengthen to correct the mistakes of the August window which left the squad lacking in many ways under previous manager Ruben Selles.

Manager Chris Wilder has discussed publicly his intention to sign up to four players â with a right-back and midfielder reinforcements deemed as priorities.

They began their much-needed recruitment drive with the additions of Jairo Riedewald, Danny Ings and Patrick Bamford on frees earlier in the season.

What have previous January windows taught us?

New owners COH had just officially taken over last year, so made a show of strength. Tom Cannon was signed for Â£10m and loanees such as Hamza Choudhury, Harry Clarke and Ben Brereton-Diaz were brought in.

The previous January the Blades were in a different place financially so only a young defender, Sam Curtis, and goalkeeper Ivo Grbic arrived.

This time around the owners need to back Wilder in the hope of a strong end to the season.

Is there any concern over specific players leaving?

Sheffield United cannot afford to lose any of their top stars in the forthcoming window. Firstly, it would harm any hopes of a play-off push. Secondly, it's highly likely fans would question the owners' ambitions for the future.

While mindful of the fact no club is immune to big offers, the Blades do not have a need to sell so that at least gives them a bit of strength and any departure - unlikely though it may be â should be more on their terms.

Wilder has already publicly discussed his intention to try to agree new deals with the likes of Gus Hamer and Tyrese Campbell, so some medium and long-term thinking is taking place.

How important is this window?

Vital. Sheffield United lost a lot of quality players in the summer â primarily Vini  Souza (Wolfsburg) and Anel Ahmedhodzic (PSV) and did not adequately replace them.

They also now have a number injuries to key players, so the need for additions is crucial if they are to turn the season around after the self-inflicted disaster of the summer.

That is particularly pertinent in central midfield. Tom Davies and Sydie Peck are sidelined for, as yet, unspecified amounts of time. And Ollie Arblaster is only just returning into life in the second tier after 13 months out with an ACL injury.

Unfortunately, the summer arrivals in the middle of the park have still to show they are of the required standard to compete at the sharp end of the Championship.

What do Wednesday need?

Ambitions amount to pretty much just getting through the season. Relegation is virtually guaranteed due to their points deductions. But the squad is so completely stretched that basically any functioning bodies would be welcome.

Ideally they could add more of a goal threat but they are going to be limited to frees and loans, assuming everything with the takeover is completed in time.

What have previous January windows taught us?

Not much - this is a very different situation than previous windows, where the manager at Sheffield Wednesday would talk about the need for additions and mostly be left disappointed by the end of the month under former owner Dejphon Chansiri. 

Now it is possible we will see new owners but restrictions courtesy of Chansiri's poor running of the club will limit what can be done in January.

Pierce Charles joined Sheffield Wednesday in 2021 having previously been part of the Manchester City academy

Is there any concern over specific players leaving?

There is definitely going to be interest in goalkeeper Pierce Charles, a player of high potential. Whether that amounts to a bid and a sale remains to be seen. 

Wednesday do not have many assets left within their playing squad. 

Apart from that, you would think new owners might want to keep hold of players given the threadbare nature of the squad.

How important is this window?

Not at all. Wednesday will be a League One club next season. The more important pressing matter is what the long-term ownership future is at Hillsborough.

What do Southampton need?

A goalkeeper to be an outright number one and another forward who can genuinely compete with Adam Armstrong and other attackers to get goals â they need more quality depth up front.

There is too much of a drop-off when substitutions are made.

What have previous January windows taught us?

Owners Sport Republic have not been good in January. The ill-fated Paul Onuachu and Kamaldeen Sulemana buys (and others) under Nathan Jones cost the club survival in the Premier League in 2023, and last January they failed to get Ivan Juric the defender he wanted to help them fight to stay up again.

Is there any concern over specific players leaving?

I do not think key players are under threat as many of them have worked out well from the summer â Casper Jander and Leo Scienza in particular.

To be honest, the squad is still way too big and too average because of that.

If five or six were to leave in January, including some of the players currently out on loan, it would be a good thing for Saints to end the window with a smaller squad.

How important is this window?

I think it is massively important. They have said there will be no financial problems or panic if they do not go up this season, but the club have openly said they absolutely are still working towards an instant return to the Premier League.

If that is the case, it is "let's back that up with actions" time at St Mary's.

What do Stoke need?

Goals. Stoke have had the Championship's best defence for most of the first half of the season but manager Mark Robins has regularly admitted that to take the next step they need to become more efficient in the final third.

It's hard to find high-quality, high-value reinforcements at centre forward or attacking midfield in January but the right addition would increase their chances of promotion substantially.

What have previous January windows taught us?

Profit and sustainability rules will dictate Stoke's spending power again and they will have to work smart to make additions and stay on the right side of the EFL.

Owner John Coates has said he thinks the regulations put his club at a competitive disadvantage and he would clearly like to spend more, but the rules, as they stand, are the rules. 

Perhaps a loan, loan to buy or a high value permanent transfer can be found by a recruitment team undoubtedly scouring the world for available talent.

Mark Robins joined Stoke on 1 January 2025

Is there any concern over specific players leaving?

It is hard to imagine the club would sanction the departure of any key players with the team fighting for a play-off place unless a truly ridiculous offer came in that would allow them to make legitimately game-changing additions.

There are players who may see this as the time to seek a fresh start though with the likes of Andre Vidigal, Ben Gibson and Spurs loanee Jamie Donley out of favour.

How important is this window?

Stoke have decent squad depth and they have shown how competitive they are over the first half of the season, so this window is far from make or break.

If they can avoid any major injury crises, they have the quality to sustain a challenge for the top six.

However, they are tantalisingly close to the sort of season that fans will remember for years so the club and the fanbase will be desperate to see their chances maximised over the next month.

What do Swansea need?

Swansea thought they had filled various vacancies in their squad after a busy summer transfer window which was widely regarded as their most successful in a number of years.

However, form so far this season has suggested the summer was not as positive as most thought it had been.

Swansea spent significantly, meaning there may not be much cash to play with in January, but some business is possible as Vitor Matos heads into his first window as head coach.

What have previous January windows taught us?

Swansea have had their share of January troubles in recent years. Last February, then boss Luke Williams suggested the club needed a "restructure" because there were "a lot of things we need to better" after a window in which Matt Grimes was sold and Lewis O'Brien and Hannes Delcroix arrived on loan.

The previous year, then chairman Andy Coleman was forced to defend transfer business amid criticism from fans, while in 2022, Russell Martin memorably brought his entire backroom team into a press conference in a show of defiance after no January signings were made.

Swansea's supporters will hope for more success in 2026, but may not be banking on it given recent history.

Is there any concern over specific players leaving?

Leading scorer Zan Vipotnik has been touted as a potential target for West Ham following his dramatic improvement this season. Clearly, the loss of an in-form striker would be a heavy blow should Premier League interest materialise.

But the player who looks Swansea's biggest asset right now is Ethan Galbraith, who has been their best player since arriving from Leyton Orient in the summer.

Swansea fans will hope the Northern Ireland international, who can play in midfield or at right-back, will be their player for a full season at the very least.

How important is this window?

If nobody departs, Swansea would probably feel they have enough quality in their squad already to pull clear of relegation danger - but a couple of January additions would be welcome nevertheless.

Josh Key has proved he is more than capable of delivering in the Championship, but his recent struggle for form has seen Galbraith pressed into right-back duty when Swansea ideally want him in midfield.

Another right-back option would be useful, therefore, while Swansea may - yet again - be in the market for a wide player, particularly if Manuel Benson's unsuccessful loan spell from Burnley is cut short.

What do Watford need?

At the beginning of the season the Watford board indicated that challenging for promotion was the target. They have been just below the play-offs most of the season and if they are to make a proper push they need to offload the unwanted players and bring in ones that head coach Javi Gracia wants.

The Hornets have a large squad but many players have not made it into the squad, let alone the team, under Gracia. 

As such, additions are needed â a central midfielder, striker and a left-footed centre-back.

What have previous January windows taught us?

Watford do not tend to do much business in January. They rarely sell at this point because they feel they can do better business in the summer.

In terms of incomings, it tends to depend on the situation they are in and whether there is a chance of promotion.

Othmane Maamma joined Watford in July on a four-year contract

Is there any concern over specific players leaving?

There are murmurings that there could be bids for young winger Othmane Maamma who has burst on to the scene and made a massive impact. 

The Moroccan Under-20 World Cup player of the tournament has only been at the club since the summer but has caught everybody's attention.

Watford would clearly miss him although they do have other wingers who could fill the gap. Imran Louza is the other potential leaver but that's more likely at the end of the season.

How important is this window?

Watford have been frustrating this season because they are so close to being a decent Championship club. 

But despite having a big squad the options are limited for Gracia as he will not feature players he does not fancy. 

If they can recruit players he will trust, then they would have a much better chance of pushing for the play-offs.

Steve Hermon, BBC Radio WM

What do West Brom need?

Albion's lack of strength in depth has been evident on multiple occasions this season.

There have been times when Ryan Mason has named two goalkeepers on his bench, which is usually a sign a head coach wants more and he's also given limited minutes to regular substitutes, like Daryl Dike and Tammer Bany.

Despite some question marks over the quality of performances in defence so far this season, the Baggies are well stocked at the back, so an addition further up the field would probably be most welcome to help keep them in touch with the top six.

What have previous January windows taught us?

The previous January window was owners Bilkul's first since taking over in 2024 and they mostly used it to look to the future. Isaac Price arrived from Standard Liege and the Northern Ireland international has really kicked on after having a full pre-season under his belt.

The Baggies had similar hopes with Bany but niggly injuries have meant he is yet to get up to speed with the Championship.

The difficulty in finding another Price is the club's ongoing battle with profit and sustainability rules, so unless there is a bargain to be had, they will likely be looking to the loan market, which they also did this time last year when forwards Adam Armstrong and Will Lankshear arrived on temporary deals.

Is there any concern over specific players leaving?

Despite the club's financial situation limiting who they can buy, they are not in a desperate need to sell. 

There are multiple players out of contract at the end of the season, such as Josh Maja, Karlan Grant, Dike and captain Jed Wallace.

If an offer came in that was too good to refuse, they could be moved on but that would be highly unlikely when they are free agents in six months.

How important is this window?

A key signing in the final third of the field could be the difference between making the top six or not and I'm sure that remains the aim internally but it would still be a tough ask.

The Championship continues to be a wide-open division where anybody can beat anyone, which means there is a chance of the play-offs, but it also means there is a lot of competition for those four places in the end-of-season lottery.

The Baggies' form in the first half of the campaign has been too inconsistent and they are unlikely to vastly improve on that with minimal business expected.

Dafydd Pritchard, BBC Sport Wales

What do Wrexham need?

There is no limit to Wrexham's ambitions and, given how heavily they have spent already this season, a play-off push is not out of the question.

Having said that, after three successive promotions, a season of consolidation in the Championship would be acceptable to many at the club.

Phil Parkinson strengthened all parts of his squad in the summer but you could argue the one thing in short supply is pace, particularly with impressive on-loan Manchester City right wing-back Issa Kabore out injured.

Do not expect a load of wingers to come in because Parkinson does not use them in his favoured 3-5-2 system, but Wrexham will probably have another fairly busy window.

What have previous January windows taught us?

That Wrexham's Hollywood owners - and more recent investors - have deep pockets, and that they will be needed in January. 

Parkinson has broken the club's transfer record several times, often on attacking upgrades. He is well-stocked there now but do not rule out anything.

Is there any concern over specific players leaving?

They have had to offload players quite ruthlessly during their rise through the leagues, given how quickly and frequently they are having to adapt to new levels.

They have not had to fend off interest from bigger clubs in their players yet and, once again, January's departures are likely to be players who have become peripheral since promotion to the Championship and are looking for regular game time.

How important is this window?

It is hard to know what Wrexham's exact target is this season but, after spending more money than any other Championship team in the summer, another busy and expensive January window would suggest they are aiming high.

The squad is comfortably good enough to finish in the top half of the table. A few more additions could turn them into real play-off contenders.

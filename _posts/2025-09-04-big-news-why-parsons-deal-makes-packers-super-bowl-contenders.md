Five things to look out for in the NFL this season

NFL 2025 season

Dates: 4 September 2025 - 8 February 2026 

BBC coverage: Live text coverage every Sunday on the BBC Sport website and app, and live radio commentary of selected games on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds, with Detroit Lions @ Green Bay Packers this Sunday (from 21:00 BST)

Micah Parsons' blockbuster trade from the Dallas Cowboys to the Green Bay Packers has sent shockwaves through the NFL.

After a long-running contract dispute, the defensive star said last month he wanted to leave Dallas.

And just a week before the start of the new season, his wish was granted.

The 26-year-old has joined the Packers on a four-year deal worth $188m (Â£139m), replacing TJ Watt as the NFL's highest-paid non-quarterback.

BBC pundits are stunned the Cowboys let a player in his prime join one of their rivals and agree the move cements Green Bay as Super Bowl contenders.

The Philadelphia Eagles prevented a Kansas City Chiefs three-peat in February and the defending champions kick off the new campaign at home to Dallas (01:20 BST Friday).

Speaking on BBC 5 Live, presenter Mark Chapman said the Parsons deal was "one of the most astonishing trades" in recent years.

"Micah Parsons was the guy the Cowboys were building their defence around, he's a generational talent," said NFL pundit Phoebe Schecter.

"It truly is mind-blowing that you'd trade him away a week before the season. That's the soap opera that Jerry Jones continues to create."

A new Netflix documentary showcases Jones, the Cowboys' controversial and charismatic owner, who masterminded three Super Bowl wins in the 1990s but has overseen 30 years of underachievement since.

In the past four seasons, for example, Dallas have managed just one play-off win, despite having one of the NFL's most devastating pass rushers. Since the Cowboys drafted Parsons in 2021, only four players have registered more sacks than him (52.5).

The defensive end had 12 from just 13 games last season, including 4.5 from the Cowboys' two games against Briton Efe Obada's former team, the Washington Commanders.

"Micah Parsons is a game-wrecker," said Obada, who is currently without a team. "I've seen him do it first hand, he wrecked our games last season, even though all week we prepared for [facing] him.

"The fear he sends to offensive coordinators is insane. Just pay your guys, I don't understand it. It's like trading [Patrick] Mahomes. Green Bay got a great one."

Dallas have also sent Parsons to another team in the NFC Conference, one which has been gradually improving since Jordan Love replaced Aaron Rodgers as the Packers' starting quarterback in 2023.

"If you were looking at a weakness for the Packers, it was on defence," said BBC broadcaster Anthony Wootton. "Suddenly you've strengthened one of the teams in your conference, which is ridiculous.

"Micah Parsons is a guy that offensive coordinators have to scheme against, that quarterbacks have to keep an eye on, because he is other-worldly. He has elevated the Packers to the next level."

Schecter added: "Green Bay already had a top-10 defence, they've got a great young quarterback talent and [head coach] Matt LaFleur is an incredibly smart football IQ guy. They've also brought in a guard [Aaron Banks] to help protect Jordan Love and have Josh Jacobs to run the ball."

How do teams get in the 'Super Bowl window'?

Love has led Green Bay to the play-offs in his first two seasons as a starter. The 26-year-old has moved on from his rookie contract to a big-money deal so now the Packers have an established quarterback, they are trying to fit the pieces around him.

On the first episode of the BBC iPlayer show, The Whole 10 Yards, Green Bay were on a list of nine teams currently in their 'Super Bowl window'.

One team from each conference reaches the big game and the Packers' main contenders in the NFC are seen as the Detroit Lions, San Francisco 49ers, Washington Commanders and defending champions Philadelphia.

In the AFC Conference, Kansas City aim to bounce back after being denied a historic triumph in February, while the Baltimore Ravens and Buffalo Bills are also led by MVP-winning quarterbacks.

The Cincinnati Bengals missed out on last season's play-offs but that was down to their defence. Quarterback Joe Burrow led the league for passing yards and touchdown passes, while Ja'Marr Chase earned the receiving triple crown, so the Bengals are still very much in their Super Bowl window.

"Offensively, they've put together an incredible package," added Schecter. "Joe Burrow completely changed that franchise and, with him in town, there's absolutely a chance they can have a Super Bowl run."

Are the Denver Broncos this season's dark horses?

It was also argued on The Whole 10 Yards that perhaps the Denver Broncos and Los Angeles Rams are also in Super Bowl contention, and given their injuries over the past year, perhaps the 49ers' window has now closed.

"They're coming off a disappointing year," said NFL reporter Matt Miller. "With [head coach] Kyle Shanahan, [quarterback] Brock Purdy and [defensive end] Nick Bosa, they have the weapons to be a perennial contender, but they have to stay healthy."

The Rams beat the Bengals in the Super Bowl three years ago and still have Matt Stafford at quarterback, so NFL reporter Ian Rapoport said he "wouldn't be that surprised" if they made a play-off run.

"They have one of the best defences and were kind of up and coming last year," he said. "I don't know that they're up and coming this year. Like, they're here."

As for Denver, quarterback Bo Nix is heading into his second season after leading the Broncos into the play-offs for the first time since they won the Super Bowl in 2016.

"The Broncos look like they're coming," Rapoport added. "Bo Nix seems to be better than maybe anyone outside of his family and [head coach] Sean Payton believed he was. They look like they're entering their window."

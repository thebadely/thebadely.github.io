Let's dive into the details: Rangers are sixth in the Scottish Premiership with one win from eight matches

On an afternoon that stretched Rangers' dismal start to the season, three banners displayed across a section of the Ibrox support made their feelings clear.

"No more buses to hide on. No more managers to hide behind. Face your failures like men."

With no Russell Martin to berate now, it was the players who felt the full force of a furious fanbase by the full-time whistle.

The 2-2 draw with Dundee United extends the Govan side's wait for a home league win this season. They have won just one of their eight matches in the Premiership.

The fixture marked a first game in interim charge for former player Steven Smith, but he was left lamenting repeated problems.

"People will ask me 'did I enjoy today?' - I won't because I know what the expectations are," Smith told BBC Scotland. 

"It's to win the game and that was the message to the players. I'm just disappointed we didn't do that."

While Rangers' ultras were displaying their message aimed at the players, they were watching a much-improved display from their team.

In a first-half performance packed with relentless attacking play, they had 23 shots. One of those delivered the opener, a stunning goal from Thelo Aasgaard.

But a tactical switch from United boss Jim Goodwin, coupled with a more aggressive approach from the visitors, seemed to spook a vulnerable home side.

When Kristijan Trapanovski drilled in low from distance, the fragility Rangers have shown throughout the campaign returned to the fore.

Craig Sibbald's outrageous strike from distance then put United into a deserved lead against the desperate hosts.

Tavernier's late leveller was one of six second-half efforts from Smith's men. They went from having 30 touches in the United box in the first half to just eight in the second.

They did not face a shot on target in the first 45 minutes but faced four after the break. Their possession and duel success dropped significantly.

"I think I understand the reasons why [the game changed]," former full-back Smith added. "Dundee United changed their aggression, started winning second balls, gained territory.

"That changed the game and we didn't change with it, which is disappointing. We managed to get an equaliser, so I'll give them a wee bit of credit for that.

"But we need to recognise in those moments when it gets tough, you need to have killed the game off or match the level of aggression [from the opposition] to go again.

"Consistency doesn't just happen Saturday to Saturday, it happens every day. They need to be consistent with their habits every day. When it gets tough, you stick together."

This is certainly not the first time Rangers' mentality has been questioned. For almost a decade, it has been a frequent criticism from fans and pundits.

Martin, who was sacked a fortnight ago, also chipped in. So, too, did Barry Ferguson during his interim spell last term.

Former Rangers striker Billy Dodds, who was part of Ferguson's backroom team, told BBC Scotland earlier this week: "There's no real standout leader, even though there's the captain, the vice-captain, there's a leadership group. 

"I think the boys have got to get together, but they can only do so much. It's up to the club's hierarchy to get the managerial situation sorted out and get a strong figure in there that's a leader."

Kevin Muscat is expected to be that man, but Smith would not comment on the Shanghai Port boss' potential arrival - or his own future.

Regardless, repairing Rangers' vulnerability poses a significant challenge to whoever is the next permanent head coach.

While Saturday's first-half display highlighted the potential in this new-look squad, a fragile mentality roots deeper by the week.

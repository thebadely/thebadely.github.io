Scorecard

Keacy Carty scored a second consecutive century in a commanding West Indies victory over Ireland that earned a draw in the one-day international series at Clontarf.

Ireland won the opening match of the series by 124 runs on Wednesday, but Friday's second meeting ended without a result after a two-hour rain delay.

In Sunday's third game, Carty again led the way for the visitors with his unbeaten 170 part of an imposing total of 385, although Ireland's revised target was set at 363 because of a reduction of overs after rain. 

With bowlers Jordan Neill and Josh Little unable to bat after injuries sustained during West Indies' innings, Ireland lost eight wickets for 165 and were beaten by 197 runs under the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method.

Stirling hits milestone as Ireland beat West Indies

After Ireland won the toss, skipper Paul Stirling put West Indies in to bat despite their tally of 352 on Friday.

Opener Brandon King was caught leg before wicket by Barry McCarthy for just one, but that brought Carty to the crease who produced his second century of the series and bettered his previous best ODI tally of 128 set against England in November.

Ireland's bowling corps was depleted by injuries both before and during the series, and Carty feasted on a tiring attack.

The 28-year-old survived a few scares on his way to the huge tally, most notably when on 150 he was bowled by Liam McCarthy only for the delivery to be deemed a no-ball.

He was eventually out for 170 when, off the bowling of Liam McCarthy, he was caught by George Dockrell who had previously gathered one deep drive but carried across the rope for a six.

With Carty ably supported by captain Shai Hope, who scored 75 off 75 balls, and a maiden international half-century from Justin Greaves, West Indies' 385 was the largest ODI tally ever scored at Clontarf. 

While Stirling's 26 contained three fours and two sixes, when set such an imposing target, Ireland's response was never at the pace required.

Cade Carmichael, who made his international debut in the series, top-scored for the hosts with his 48 coming off 63 balls.

Next up for West Indies will be three one-day internationals and three T20s against England which begin on Thursday at Edgbaston to start Harry Brook's white-ball captaincy for the hosts.

West Indies will return to Ireland for three T20 internationals to be played at Bready next month.

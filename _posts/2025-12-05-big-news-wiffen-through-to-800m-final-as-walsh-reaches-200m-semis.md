Here’s what you need to know: Daniel Wiffen has already won gold in the 1500m freestyle and bronze in the 400m freestyle in Poland

Ireland's Daniel Wiffen is through to the 800m freestyle final at the European Short Course Swimming Championships [25m] in Lublin.

The Olympic 800m freestyle champion finished as the fourth fastest in qualifying with a time of 7:34.60 as he progressed to Saturday's final.

He was second in his heat behind Hungary's Zalan Sarkany, who finished in a time of 7:33.85.

Wiffen won bronze in the men's 400m freestyle on Tuesday and put in a late surge to retain his 1500m freestyle title on Thursday.

The Magheralin man finished ahead of Hungarian Sarkany by 1.55 seconds to win his first gold medal since he had surgery on his appendix in August.

Great Britain's Jack McMillan, who won gold in the 400m in Poland, failed to progress to the semi-finals of the 100m freestyle.

McMillan, an Olympic and world champion in the men's 4x200m freestyle relay who is from Belfast, topped his heat with a time of 47.02, but was 18th fastest overall and is second reserve for Friday night's semi-finals.

Ireland's Ellen Walsh advanced to the semi-finals of the women's 200m individual medley by qualifying as sixth fastest as she topped her heat in a time of 2:09.21.

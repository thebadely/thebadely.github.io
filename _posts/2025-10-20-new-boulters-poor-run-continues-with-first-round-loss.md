Let's dive into the details: Katie Boulter has not made it past the second round at a Grand Slam in 2025

British number three Katie Boulter's poor run of form continued with a straight-sets loss to world number 44 Eva Lys in the first round of the Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo.

Boulter, 29, was beaten 6-2 6-1 in just one hour and 14 minutes by the 23-year-old German. 

She was the only British player in the main draw after Emma Raducanu withdrew, ending her season early through illness.

The Briton was only able to win 50% of the points on her first serve and was broken five times by Lys.

This latest defeat caps a disappointing run of form, which has seen the former world number 29 unable to progress beyond the second round of a tournament since the Nottingham Open in June. 

It also comes five days after the Briton lost in straight sets in the second round of the Japan Open by world number 51 Sorana Cirstea.

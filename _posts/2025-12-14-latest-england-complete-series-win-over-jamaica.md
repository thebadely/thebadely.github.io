England beat Jamaica 81-30 in the Horizon series

England produced another clinical display to beat a depleted Jamaica side 81-30 at London's Copper Box Arena on Sunday to complete a 2-0 series win. 

Jess Thirlby's Roses side followed up Saturday's 80-37 victory with an even more comprehensive performance. 

Like Saturday, they opened up a 23-point advantage by half time and pulled away from a visiting side hit by injuries by adding 43 points in the second half. 

Helen Housby led the way in goal attack, piling on the points with a clinical display that saw her named player of the series. 

"I don't think you will have seen many England teams be that ruthless and purposeful with how they see games out and you can see that by the scoreline," Thirlby told BBC Sport. 

"Yes, Jamaica will be stronger again, both for having come here with some of their new talent and with some of the players who will return, but for now we can only play the team in front of us and we should be very proud."    

Jamaica won the inaugural 2024 Horizon series 2-1, which enabled them to leapfrog England and go third in the world rankings.

The 2025 series was due to consist of four fixtures - two in Jamaica in early December and two in England - but the matches in Kingston were cancelled following the devastation caused by Hurricane Melissa.

Members of the Jamaica team helped in the relief effort, handing out care packages, and have been unable to train as a whole squad.

England Netball will donate Â£1 from every Horizon Series ticket sold to Netball Jamaica's chosen charity, World Central Kitchen, and has also announced fans will be able to contribute to the British Red Cross' Disaster Fund.

But with less than a year to go until the 2026 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, the Horizon Series provides crucial game time for both nations.

Thirlby added: "We really respect any Jamaican side and I hope their players who were taken off the court injured are OK.

"I just want to thank them for an incredible effort to get over here and see another Horizon series."

In Saturday's match, captain Fran Williams was named player of the match after leading by example, while Eleanor Cardwell continued her recovery from a serious knee injury and Natalie Metcalf played for the first time since having a baby seven months ago. 

"The girls make it so easy coming into camp, which just makes it easy when you get on court. It felt really connected," Cardwell told BBC Sport.

"I just love playing games of netball and I've not played many this year so it's really nice. 

"There has been a lot of crying this year. I didn't realise I had this much mental toughness so it's been hard but I have learned so much on this journey and I think it's going to make me a better netballer."

According to new developments, Fin Graham won Paralympic gold in Paris last year

Fin Graham won his fourth successive road race World Championship title as Great Britain's Para-cyclists brought home nine medals from Belgium.

Graham, 25, launched an attack inside the final kilometre and held off France's Thomas Peyroton Dartet to retain his C3 crown.

His victory came two days after he won time trial bronze in Ronse.

"To win a first world title back in 2022 was a dream come true, so to now be retaining that for the fourth year in a row, is something that I could never have imagined," he said.

"To do it here in Belgium, with that crowd, was phenomenal. I was made to work for it; it was such a hard race.

"It has finished off a really good week for our squad. Retaining this title, as Paralympic champion, is very special. To race in the rainbow stripes for another year is still a pinch me moment. I'll never get tired of looking down and seeing the rainbow bands."

Earlier on Sunday, Sophie Unwin - with her pilot Jenny Holl - won bronze in the women's B road race, while Morgan Newberry won the same colour in the C5 equivalent.

Those followed silvers for both riders on Friday in their respective time trials.

There was a bronze medal too for Archie Atkinson in the C4 road race, while Felix Barrow finished third in the T2 race.

On Thursday, Callum Russell became the first British man to win a World Championship hand bike medal when he won bronze in the H4 time trial.

Here’s what you need to know: The 2025-26 season has been rebranded as the 'Prem' and has a new logo

The start of the 2025-26 season in English rugby's top flight has arrived much the same as any other year, but with some noticeable differences.

The Premiership has been rebranded the 'Gallagher Prem' for the new campaign and comes with a new logo too as part of a drive to market the game to more fans.

It also begins with a Thursday night match between Sale and Gloucester, for the first time in its history.

But there are still 10 clubs and 18 rounds of regular-season matches before the play-offs and a Twickenham final where the champions will be crowned on 20 June, 2026.

BBC Sport examines the prospects for each of the 10 clubs.

Commentary of every Prem Rugby game is available on BBC local radio, via BBC Sounds or the BBC Sport website.

Bath ended a 29-year wait for a Premiership title in June as they also clinched a treble

2024-25: First, champions

Key signing: Henry Arundell, winger

Gareth 'Cooch' Chilcott, former Bath prop and BBC Radio Bristol commentator

What a season for Bath, the challenge now is to maintain the standards of 2024-25.

The European Champions Cup still eludes them and must be their goal for the forthcoming season, but the treble in all other tournaments last season was a massive achievement and rightly enters the record books.

The club continues to bring in world-class competitors, with Santi Carreras and Henry Arundel both joining, while the renewal of Finn Russell's contract adds even more depth to Bath's star-studded squad.

They will have to rearrange the backroom staff, however, as a result of highly respected attack coach Lee Blackett's move to England and it will need all of Johann van Grann's vast skills to steer this well-funded group of star performers through the season and manage the expectations of his players.

It's hard to look anywhere else in the Prem considering the size and quality of the squad, so it should be another great season.

Bristol are one of two of the 10 current Prem clubs to have never won the title

2024-25: Fourth, semi-finalists

Key signing: Louis Rees-Zammit, winger

Dan Albutt, BBC Radio Bristol commentator

Bristol will feel the NFL's loss is very much their gain with Wales and Lions wing Louis Rees-Zammit returning to rugby to add to the excitement at Ashton Gate.

He's perfect for the Bears' style of play and a pairing with Gabriel Ibitoye gives Bristol one of the most dangerous wing duos in the Prem. 

The signing of versatile Scotland back Tom Jordan has somewhat gone under the radar following the arrival of Rees-Zammit, but he's another exciting player who gives fans genuine belief of bettering last season's semi-final finish. 

Those additions, along with impressive Argentina lock Pedro Rubiolo, add to the optimism. Although the squad is smaller, it's very talented.

If Bristol hit their straps consistently, maybe now is the time for them to be serious title contenders.

Exeter made big changes to their coaching staff towards the end of last season  

2024-25: Ninth

Key signing: Len Ikitau, centre

Brent Pilnick, BBC Sport England, south-west:

When Exeter were on their way to a league and European double five years ago, few would have thought that come 2025 we would be talking about a side having ended the 2024-25 season with their worst top-flight record in history and a fourth successive campaign outside the play-offs.

But such has been the churn over those years that Exeter now rank as an outsider rather than a certainty.

Huge coaching upheaval at the end of last season has to pay dividends this term -  Rob Hunter and Ali Hepher are no longer involved and long-serving director of rugby Rob Baxter has a more hands-on role alongside new attack coach Dave Walder.

On the field, the Chiefs have recruited strongly from Australia in the shape of Wallabies centre Len Ikitau and lock/flanker Tom Hooper, plus hooker Julian Heaven, while Italy scrum-half Stephen Varney has also joined.

Exeter need their new players to hit the ground running - and keep the likes of Immanuel Feyi-Waboso and Henry Slade fit - if they are to kick on, because Red Bull's investment in Newcastle looks like ensuring the battle at the bottom of the table will be a much tighter affair this season than for the past few years.

Ross Byrne is one of 12 new signings for Gloucester after 19 departures from last season's squad

2024-25: Fifth

Key signing: Ross Byrne, fly-half

Andrew Pugh, BBC Radio Gloucestershire commentator:

Gloucester Rugby finished last season in a frustrating fifth place, but their change to a more expansive, entertaining style made them many friends.

The outstanding Tomos Williams was the catalyst for much of that success, but the departures of Gareth Anscombe, Zach Mercer, Ruan Ackermann, Chris Harris and Santi Carreras leaves big boots to fill.

Director of rugby George Skivington has made significant squad changes, including investing in the experience of Ireland fly-half Ross Byrne to provide control, and former All Black Nepo Laulala to add power to the front row.

In addition, Gloucester's loyal supporters will hope that new England caps Seb Atkinson and Arthur Clark continue to prosper.

But ultimately, much will depend on how well the wider group of newcomers from the academy, Hartpury, and other clubs gel and deliver.

Head coach Danny Wilson (far right) left Quins two weeks before the start of the new season

2024-25: Seventh

Key signing: Guido Petti, lock 

Andrew Rowley, BBC Radio London commentator:

It's hard to think there hasn't been major disruption with the departure of head coach Danny Wilson to join Wales' coaching staff on the eve of the new season. 

Quins have been here before, when Paul Gustard left and 'the coaching collective' went on to win the title but still, the timing is far from ideal.

Behind the scenes, the club have worked hard to tie down their star English players and with most of them in the mid-to-late 20s age range, the hope is they are entering their peak years. 

The Twickenham side have a strong back row and a richly talented backline. They have also worked to bolster the front row, second row and half-backs. Guido Petti is the stand-out signing; the imposing forward has featured in three World Cups for Argentina and arrives from Bordeaux-Begles as a Champions Cup winner. 

Quins had a season of transition last season but admitted they weren't satisfied. They need to find the grit and determination to win the tight games to mount a challenge for the top four.

Geoff Parling has become Leicester's ninth head coach in nine seasons

2024-25: Second, beaten finalists

Key signing: James O'Connor, fly-half

Adam Whitty, BBC Radio Leicester sports editor:

Leicester really are this season's unknown proposition.

Geoff Parling has the potential to do very well at Welford Road. His time coaching, most recently with Australia, combined with a trophy-laden time as a player at Tigers, has fans excited. But he needs time to get things the way he wants, which is not something Leicester's hierarchy have offered in the past.

They begin this season without some of the talismanic figures that have defined their recent past. International players like Julian Montoya and Handre Pollard have been replaced by Newcastle's Jamie Blamire, and two fascinating fly-halves â Orlando Bailey from Bath and Wallabies playmaker James O'Connor respectively. 

The retirement of Ben Youngs and Dan Cole also leaves room for a new generation. Home-grown talent such as Freddie Steward, Jack van Poortvliet, George Martin and Ollie Chessum are perfectly suited to taking on the mantle. They will also be responsible for opening Tigers' game up, bit by bit, while keeping their gnarly edge.

Last season's runners-up could continue the form they found under Michael Cheika and hit the ground running. But I wouldn't be stunned if they fell flat on their face either.

Newcastle return with a new name, new kit and a high-profile new sponsor

2024-25: 10th

Key signing: Simon Benitez Cruz, scrum-half

Dean Gray, BBC Radio Newcastle commentator: 

In recent seasons the Falcons have lost their best players and most promising youngsters, lured away by the prospect of bolstering their international ambitions, their bank balances and their job security. 

This led to them finishing bottom of the Premiership in the last three seasons and the owner, Semore Kurdi, putting the club up for sale.

The takeover by Red Bull and the inevitable renaming of the team to Newcastle Red Bulls came late in the day, but come it did, and the promotional and marketing expertise of the energy drink giant, coupled with its huge financial clout, will make a massive difference.

Director of rugby Steve Diamond has done well to assemble another dozen or so hard-nosed players in a short period of time before the start of the season, but the true potential for the team is yet to be realised and some superstar signings have been whispered about.

Expect this team to soar in a couple of seasons or so.

Saints' core of England players are likely to be key to how their season goes in 2025-26

2024-25: Eighth

Key signing: Callum Chick, back-row

Graham McKechnie, BBC Radio Northampton commentator

Although they reached the Champions Cup final, beating Leinster in Dublin along the way, Saints coaches and players view last season as a disappointment. 

As defending champions, finishing eighth in the league wasn't good enough and something everyone wants to put right. 

Some big names left over the summer, notably Juarno Augustus and Temo Mayanavanua, but there's a sense that the squad should be stronger this season, with JJ van der Mescht, Callum Chick and Anthony Belleau all arriving. 

They will need their returning quartet of Lions back on form too, when they are able to play again.

Much will depend on keeping the whole squad fit.

Last season Saints suffered more than most with international call-ups, which is likely to be the same this time. If they can avoid last season's injury problems, breaking back into the top four this season is their priority. 

The Champions Cup run was a lot of fun - more of that would be very welcome too.

Sale have lost in the semi-finals for the past two seasons

2024-25: Third

Key signing: Jacques Vermeulen, back row

Robin Grey, BBC Radio Manchester commentator:

After making the top four in the past three seasons, Sale Sharks have been tantalisingly close to Premiership glory for some time. 

With their core of youth players at the heart of their progress, how they cope without departed forwards Jonny Hill and Jean-Luc du Preez will be a test. 

Jacques Vermeulen brings plenty of experience from Exeter Chiefs and the South African contingent continues with centre Marius Louw tasting English rugby for the first time in his career. 

A top-four finish is expected at Sale, but if they can keep the Curry brothers fit and the likes of Asher Opoku-Fordjour continue to progress, there will be hopes of a top-two finish and Twickenham glory.

Maro Itoje returns to Saracens having captained the British and Irish Lions to victory in Australia this summer

2024-25: Sixth

Key signing: Owen Farrell, fly-half

Andrew Rowley, BBC Radio London commentator:

Saracens re-signing Owen Farrell was the headline but they have also managed to bring versatile winger/full-back Max Malins back into the fold from Bristol.

The north Londoners have also added some bulk in the front five which will complement their excellent back row and combination of experience and potential in the backline. 

Last season saw too much of a disparity between their best and worst performances, so what they might be aiming for more than anything is consistency.

And I would expect that improvement to come.

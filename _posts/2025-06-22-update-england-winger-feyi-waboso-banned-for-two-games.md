According to new developments, Immanuel Feyi-Waboso has won eight caps for England

England winger Immanuel Feyi-Waboso has been banned for two games after being sent off against a France XV on Saturday.

Feyi-Waboso was shown a 34th-minute red card at Allianz Stadium after catching Antoine Hastoy on the head with a swinging right arm as he attempted a tackle.

The Exeter wing, 22, missed England's Six Nations campaign after dislocating his shoulder in December and is now suspended for their two-Test series in Argentina.

Once he has completed World Rugby's coaching intervention programme - informally known as tackle school - Feyi-Waboso will be available for the final match of England's summer tour against the United States on Saturday, 19 July.

World Rugby said "Feyi-Waboso's actions were contrary to Law 9.13 (dangerous tackle), and carried a high degree of danger".

France forward Cameron Woki, who was also sent off after his yellow card was upgraded to a red for an illegal clear-out on England hooker Jamie George, is to face a full disciplinary hearing over the incident.

England head coach Steve Borthwick is set to name his summer touring party on Monday.

Steve Borthwick has been relishing reintroducing Immanuel Feyi-Waboso to the England set-up, but will now surely leave the 22-year-old out of his touring squad when he names it on Monday, rather than take him with only a run-out against the United States in Washington DC possible.

It might all be for the best for Feyi-Waboso. There was a school of thought that after six months out, a full pre-season with his club side Exeter might be the best thing to get him back to the heights he reached in a breakout 2024 campaign.

This ban actually hits his British and Irish Lions chances less severely.

Given the tourists' packed schedule, consisting of two games a week in the run-up to the first Test on 19 July, Feyi-Waboso could serve his suspension and be free to face the Wallabies. It would be a big call for Lions coach Andy Farrell though to call up a player who has been out for so long and lasted so little time on his comeback, however talented.

Perhaps most intriguing is the possibilities it opens up for other wings to stake a claim on England's tour. Leicester's Adam Radwan and Ollie Hassell-Collins - who were both left out of the squad to face a second-string France XV - will be keeping their phones on loud. Sale's Tom Roebuck, who impressed on Saturday, is starting to look like one of the first names on the team sheet.

Will Muir, who was out of contention for the Six Nations with a hamstring injury, and Cadan Murley, who suffered a difficult debut against Ireland in Dublin in the tournament, will contend. Bristol's Gabriel Ibitoye and Bath-bound Henry Arundell both offer high-revving pace.

After watching Argentina's win over the Lions on Friday evening, England will know whoever lines up at 11 and 14 will be up against clinical strike runners.

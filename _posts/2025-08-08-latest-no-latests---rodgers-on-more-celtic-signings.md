According to new developments, Brendan Rodgers understands his club demands value for money

Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers says "there's no news" on transfers - a week on from indicating his frustration at summer window activity.

But he reassured supporters that those running the club had come good in the past as he waits for additions before the transfer deadline.

As he entered the final season of his three-year contract, Rodgers had suggested he would need the board to match his ambitions to stay longer. 

Centre-half Jahmai Simpson-Pusey's loan deal from Manchester City has been completed since then, but the Celtic manager said "I've got nothing new for you" as he was asked about further additions before Sunday's visit to Aberdeen.

"It's very clear what we need to improve and there's a lot of work going on, clearly, by ourselves and probably every club," he added. "That's the reality of this time of the year.

"We're hoping that we can conclude some deals and improve the squad."

New striker signing Shin Yamada has yet to make his debut, with the absence of Kyogo Furuhashi, who was sold to Rennes in January and now at Birmingham City, still being felt.

Meanwhile, Celtic have also lost Jota to a long-term knee injury and sold fellow winger Nicolas Kuhn to Como.

Asked if he could understand supporters' frustration, Rodgers said: "I think the board have shown over many years that the work will get done.

"And, obviously, as a group that run the club and have run it so well for so many years, they have to get what they will feel is the best value for the players.

"Of course, as coaches and managers and supporters, you want the best players.

"But, ultimately, the club will be run in a way that makes sure that both the best players and the best value is there to be made. And that sits above me, that's something that clearly does."

Rodgers added "I really don't know" when asked if new signings might appear in the 10 days before Celtic's Champions League play-off first leg against either Kairat Almaty or Slovan Bratislava, who meet again in Bratislava next week with the Kazakh side 1-0 up.

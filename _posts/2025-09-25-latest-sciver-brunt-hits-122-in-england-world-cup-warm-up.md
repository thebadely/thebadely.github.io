Scorecard

Captain Nat Sciver-Brunt struck 122 as England beat India by 152 runs in the first of their two warm-up matches before their World Cup opener next week.

In a pre-tournament boost to her side, Sciver-Brunt hit 13 fours and two sixes in Bengaluru before retiring out after 105 balls to give others a chance to bat.

Emma Lamb made a 59-ball 81 at number five in England's impressive 339-9 while opener Amy Jones hit 39 and Heather Knight 37.

Jones' opener partner Tammy Beaumont was bowled by Renuka Singh in the first over for a three-ball duck, however, and Danni Wyatt-Hodge caught for one from three balls in the 46th.

England then dismissed World Cup co-hosts India for 187 in 34 overs, though the World Cup hosts rested key batters Smriti Mandhana, Harmanpreet Kaur and Pratika Rawal.

Spinners Linsey Smith and Sophie Ecclestone took 2-35 and 2-38 respectively, while Lauren Bell, Lauren Filer and Charlie Dean claimed a wicket each.

Jemimah Rodrigues scored 66 on her return from illness for India but they lost their last eight wickets for 56 runs after Richa Ghosh was run out for 21.

Most concerning for India was their seamer Arundhati Reddy having to leave the field in a wheelchair after taking a blow in the 13th over of England's innings.

Reddy, who played in two of three matches in India's pre-tournament series against Australia, appeared to be hit in the leg in her follow-through by a drive from Knight.

She required lengthy treatment and did not add to her 4.4 overs after leaving the field or bat.

England have not played a full 50-over series since their 2-1 defeat by India in July with two unofficial matches against New Zealand in the United Arab Emirates their preparation prior to this low-key encounter.

England play Australia in their final warm-up on Sunday before beginning their World Cup campaign against South Africa on 3 October.

The tournament, co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka, runs from 30 September to 2 November.

Reddy has played 11 one-day internationals

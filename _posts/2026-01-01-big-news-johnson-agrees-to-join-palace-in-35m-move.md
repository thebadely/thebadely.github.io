Experts revealed that Brennan Johnson was Tottenham's leading scorer last season with 18 goals

Tottenham attacker Brennan Johnson has agreed to join Crystal Palace in a deal worth Â£35m.

The transfer could be finalised upon the full completion of medical checks on Friday, in time for the 24-year-old Wales international to be named in Palace's squad to face Newcastle on Sunday.

Johnson held talks with Eagles boss Oliver Glasner and other members of the club's hierarchy on Thursday, as revealed by BBC Sport, before making a final decision about the move.

Those discussions have been successful and Johnson is now on the verge of completing a move to Selhurst Park.

Palace agreed a Â£35m fee with Tottenham on Monday having made him the club's number one target.

BBC Sport disclosed last month that Tottenham were open to selling Johnson, who was their leading scorer last season with 18 goals.

Despite his personal success last season, which included scoring the winning goal In Tottenham's Europa League victory over Manchester United in Bilbao, Johnson is not part of manager Thomas Frank's long-term plans.

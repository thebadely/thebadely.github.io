According to new developments, World number one Scottie Scheffler is aiming to win his first Open

World number one Scottie Scheffler says some players have shown support for his pre-Open comments questioning why he plays golf. 

On Tuesday, before the championship got under way at Royal Portrush, the three-time major winner said professional golf was "not a fulfilling life" and questioned "the point" of pursuing victories with such zeal.

Playing alongside fellow major winners Shane Lowry and Xander Schauffele, Scheffler shot a three-under-par 68 in his opening round on Thursday as he seeks a first Claret Jug.

"It's just a matter of perspective, and I've had some players come up to me and say that they feel and think the same things," the American said.

"If anybody has disagreed with me, they haven't said it to my face yet, so I don't know what the reaction would be."

In a meaningful answer, which came at the end of is pre-tournament news conference, Scheffler said he would quit the sport if it started to impact his relationship with his wife, Meredith, and his 14-month old son, Bennett.

He said he should maybe "be a little less honest" in his responses in news conferences, but he tries to be as truthful as possible.

"I think I try to be as honest as I can with you, with the stuff that I'm willing to kind of say," the 29-year-old said.

"At times I feel like maybe I should be a little less honest. Maybe I shouldn't have said the stuff I said because now I'm going to get asked about it more."

He added the winning feeling in golf is not the "be all and end all", and on Thursday he reiterated his motivation to win remains as high as ever despite the comments regarding fulfilment. 

Scheffler carded a strong opening round in Northern Ireland and is one shot off clubhouse leaders Matthew Fitzpatrick, Jacob Skov Olesen of Denmark and China's Haotong Li.

"This week I'm trying to play good enough to win the golf tournament," he said.

"I think I've made that pretty clear over the course of my career.

"I'm just glad to be out playing golf and competing again."

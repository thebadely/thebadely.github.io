Let's dive into the details: Blaze skipper Kirstie Gordon is currently out of action with a back injury

Kirstie Gordon has committed her future to Scotland more than eight years on from a switch to England. 

The 28-year-old slow left-arm bowler made 60 Scotland appearances before opting to pursue a full-time career in the English professional system.

Born in Huntly, Aberdeenshire, she played in five matches at the 2018 Women's T20 World Cup as England finished runners-up.

Gordon was also selected for a 2019 Test match against Australia.

Currently rehabilitating from a back injury, the Blaze captain hopes to be fit for the start of the 2026 domestic season.

"It's always been in the back of my mind in the last couple of years to return to Scotland," said Gordon, who was just 14 when she made her international debut in blue.

"It has helped having [head coach] Craig Wallace in my ear. He's been on the phone a few times and I feel like I've really connected with him and his vision for the team."

Gordon plays alongside Scotland captain Kathryn Bryce and wicketkeeper Sarah Bryce for Blaze and says that was also a factor in her decision to "come home".

Gordon's experience prompted a rule change in the English domestic game, with Scots no longer classed as overseas players.

Scotland are preparing for the ICC Women's T20 World Cup Qualifier in Nepal in January, with Wallace saying: "It's exciting to hear Kirstie is now available for selection.

"She's obviously a top-class player and an excellent person.

"I think the most pleasing thing about her decision is that it shows the strength of our squad, that somebody of Kirstie's ability is wanting to come and challenge to compete for a place in the team."

Experts revealed that The Prince of Wales has officially opened a specialist centre for motor neurone disease (MND) named after rugby league legend Rob Burrow.

The centre for patients and their families was the idea of the Leeds Rhinos star, who was diagnosed with the disease in 2019 and died aged 41 in June 2024, and his consultant Dr Agam Jung.

It is the first purpose-built facility dedicated entirely to MND care, research, education and holistic support.

Touring the facility at Seacroft Hospital in Leeds, Prince William told Burrow's children - Macy, Maya and Jackson - they should be "so proud of your father because he really was an incredibly brave and very special man".

Prince William said he believed that the rugby league player's legacy would "live on".

"This is a world-leading centre that's going to save a lot of lives," he told Burrow's children.

"For that you shall all be very proud - and everyone is very grateful for letting us in on your family life and understanding what you've been managing together."

As well as the rugby star's children, the prince also spoke to Burrow's widow, Lindsey.

Mrs Burrow said: "It such a special day for the family. To have the prince come and open the centre is a really special day.

"Rob asked him, 'would you come and open the centre', and he's kept his word.

"So, to have him here today is a huge honour and privilege. I think it just shows his kindness and consideration.

"He wrote to us after we lost Rob and it was a really heartfelt message. And that's something we take a lot of comfort from."

Prince William also spoke to Kevin Sinfield, Burrow's friend and former Leeds Rhinos teammate, who has raised a total of more than £10m for MND charities since 2019.

The prince presented both Burrow and Sinfield with CBEs at Headingley Stadium in 2024 to recognise their outstanding contributions to the fight against the disease.

Sinfield said the prince was "a man of his word and he's been a massive supporter of the work we've done, the running we've done, the campaigning we've done".

"Rob would have been so proud of it. He would've loved to have seen it today," he said.

Sinfield, who will begin the latest of his challenges on 1 December, added: "To get to see this when we're about 10 days before we go again, just adds more fuel. 

"It shows what can be created when people come together for a great cause."

Speaking at the event, Prince William said: "Having met the family and Kevin and Rob in January 2024 for the first time in a very sweaty, smelly Leeds rugby changing room, it's been my pleasure to get to know them and follow their journey.

"And, frankly, we're stood in one of the most incredible buildings, that's been fundraised and supported by a few individuals who've gone above and beyond to make MND finally on the map.

"I'm honoured to be here today and see it up and running in just over a year."

The new centre has been opened after a £6.8m fundraising campaign led by Leeds Hospitals Charity and Dr Jung, who is now the director of the centre.

Paul Watkins, director of fundraising at Leeds Hospitals Charity, said he remembered Burrow asking Prince William to open the centre.

Describing the visit, Mr Watkins said the prince was "very generous and very congratulatory on the amazing effort, and he was only too happy to be here today".

"I remember when Rob asked the cheeky question about whether he would open it and he said he would, so this has been the icing on the cake as the prince has followed the family really closely during the journey," he said.

Mr Watkins added that Prince William had also donated a coffee machine to the centre, which the "patients and staff will absolutely love as it was a really meaningful gift for us to accept".

Let's dive into the details: Wayne Rooney and Marcus Rashford were team-mates for both Manchester United and England

Former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney doesn't believe the environment was to blame for Marcus Rashford being unable to perform consistently for the Red Devils.

Rashford scored 138 goals in 426 matches for United since making his debut for the club in 2016 and won five major trophies.

He scored 30 goals in all competitions in 2022-23 but has been unable to match that form since and fell out of favour, spending the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa.

Rashford is now flourishing on loan at Barcelona and he said recently in an interview he had been in an "inconsistent environment for a very long time"., external

However, speaking on the latest episode of The Wayne Rooney Show, Rooney said: "I think the environment hasn't been right but that is down to yourself. 

"If you are not playing well or you get left out of the team then I think it is easier to blame the environment and whether that is right or wrong. I think that comes from how you apply yourself.

"In games we have seen with him where we know he can do more, we know he can run more - that is nothing to do with an environment.

"I might be wrong here, I really like Marcus as a lad and as a person but I think that is an easy one to throw at people."

The Premier League returns this weekend after the international break, with Manchester United taking on fierce rivals Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday (16:30 BST).

United's form has been inconsistent so far, but with three wins in their past five games Ruben Amorim's side may feel they are facing the Reds at the right time - the defending champions having lost their past three games in all competitions.

"If Liverpool lose four games in a row and lose to Manchester United at Anfield, I think the pressure is definitely on them," Rooney added.

"I think when you bring so many new players in who all probably have a bit of an ego in their own way, all wanting to do well and trying to find that chemistry with each other, I think that hasn't quite hit off yet.

"Even though they won the first five Premier League games, I think the last three games have shown everyone and exposed the first five games and shown that maybe things haven't been right all season.

"I think it is a good reset time for Liverpool."

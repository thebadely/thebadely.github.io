According to new developments, This week, Jurassic World Rebirth hits the big screen, more than three decades after the first film in the dinosaur franchise came out.

But that's not all the next seven days have in store.

The much-anticipated Oasis reunion tour kicks off, with a BBC livestream covering all the build-up and reaction, Evita officially opens starring Rachel Zegler, and The Sandman returns for season two.

Read on for what's coming up this week...

In 1993, a cultural phenomenon swept the world with the release of the first Jurassic Park film.

Directed by Steven Spielberg, the film sparked a global fascination with dinosaurs, while its use of computer-generated imagery was considered groundbreaking at the time.

Six films have since been released, with a seventh - Jurassic World Rebirth - out on Wednesday.

It is directed by Gareth Edwards, and stars US actress Scarlett Johansson and Bridgerton's Jonathan Bailey, who were seen locking lips at the film's London premiere.

Bailey later told Entertainment Tonight: "I believe in being able to show the love in all different ways and if you can't kiss your friends... life is too short not to." 

Set five years after the events of 2022's Jurassic World Dominion, it explores a world where the surviving dinosaurs live in isolated tropical regions. Early reviews so far have been mixed.

Writing on X, Variety's Jazz Tangcay called the film a "roaring triumph" and "a beautiful homage to the original".

But The Flick Pick's host John Flickinger was more critical, saying it "just feels blah", adding: "It's a string of forgettable scenes that go nowhere."

Last summer, there was nothing short of a frenzy when Oasis announced they would be reuniting for a series of live shows.

A blizzard of headlines and a social media storm followed as tickets went on sale, with many fans criticising the sales process and prices.

For those lucky enough to get tickets, it all gets started this week, with the first gig taking place at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff.

But if you missed out, you can still join in on some of the action.

The BBC is putting on a special livestream, Oasis: Countdown to the Comeback, building up to the highly anticipated gig. Hosted by Jason Mohammad and Tina Daheley, the show begins at 1pm on Friday and will be broadcast from a site overlooking the stadium.

You won't be able to watch the actual gig, but what you will get is a mix of live coverage, special guests, and on-the-ground reports from our team speaking to fans across the city.

After the gig, there will also be instant reactions and live reviews as the excitement continues into the night.

People strolling through central London over the last couple of weeks may have caught a free performance from Snow White star Rachel Zegler.

The actress is playing the lead role in Lord Andrew Lloyd-Webber's Evita, which formally opens on Tuesday after running previews since mid-June.

This production has Zegler belt out Don't Cry for Me Argentina, the show's most well-known song, to passersby from a balcony above the entrance of London Palladium, while those who bought tickets watch from inside via a video feed.

The balcony serenade is the latest twist from director Jamie Lloyd, who's known for blending theatre and film. Last year, Tom Holland performed part of Romeo & Juliet on a rooftop.

Theatre blogger Carl Woodward appreciates some paying audiences members have been left feeling "a bit aggrieved".

However, Lord Lloyd-Webber told BBC Radio 2 that Zegler was a "bit of a phenomenon". He added: "She does Rainbow High in Evita, which is the really difficult song, I think the best I've ever heard it."

On Thursday, season two of The Sandman lands on Netflix.

The first instalment, based on British author Neil Gaiman's comic book series, came out in 2022 and was well received by critics and fans.

We're told the new and final season, once again starring Tom Sturridge as Dream, will see him facing a string of impossible decisions as he tries to save himself, his kingdom, and the waking world from the fallout of his misdeeds.

Showrunner Allan Heinberg said he hoped the adaptation would “surprise and delight the comics' loyal readers as well as fans of our show”.

Earlier this year, Gaiman was accused of sexual misconduct by eight women, including four who had previously spoken out.

He denied the allegations, saying he had "never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone. Ever".

Following the claims, several of his film and TV projects were affected, but The Sandman is still going out as planned.

Netflix declined to comment when approached by BBC News.

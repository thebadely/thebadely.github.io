Let's dive into the details: Kick It Out was set up to fight racism in football in 1993, and in 1997 expanded to tackle all forms of discrimination

Anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out says it received record-high reports of discrimination during the 2024-25 season with a rise in sexism, transphobia and faith-based abuse.

Across all levels of English football last season, there were 1,398 incidents reported  - up from the 1,332 published in last season's figures - and the most ever received by the organisation.

Reports of sexism and misogyny rose by 67%, with reports increasing from 115 in the 2023-24 season to 192.

Faith-based abuse reports climbed from 117 to 132, while reports of transphobia doubled from 22 to 44.

Reports involving girls' football doubled to 31, including two at under-9s level, while overall youth reports rose from 144 to a record high of 186.

Overall reports of racism fell across all levels of football, but the number of racist incidents in the professional game increased from 223 to 245.

Kick It Out also noted in its end-of-season reporting statistics for last season: 

There were 621 reports of online abuse submitted - a 5% rise on last year - with 268 related to racism.

There were 18 reports of sexist chanting received for 2024-25, which almost matched the total from the previous four seasons combined.

Grassroots football accounted for 325 reports - up from 303 in 2023-24. 

Homophobic abuse fell slightly, down from 162 to 139 reports.

Disability abuse also had a significant increase, with reports up by 45% across all levels of the game from 51 to 76.

Kick It Out chief executive Samuel Okafor said "discrimination remains deeply embedded across the game", and the rise in abuse in youth football "should be a wake-up call".

Okafor acknowledged there had been a "clear shift" in people "calling out sexist behaviour", but he wants to see greater action to tackle online abuse.

"It's clear that online platforms are still falling short. The volume of abuse remains high, and too often those responsible face no consequences," said Okafor.

"Fans are doing their part by speaking up. It's now up to football authorities, tech companies and government to show they're listening, and to act."

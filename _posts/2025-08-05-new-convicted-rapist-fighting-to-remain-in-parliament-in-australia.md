Experts revealed that An Australian politician convicted of rape is fighting - from his jail cell - to remain a member of the New South Wales (NSW) state parliament.

Gareth Ward was last month found guilty of sexually assaulting two young men, aged 18 and 24, at his home between 2013 and 2015, and is now in custody pending sentencing.

The NSW House of Representatives had planned to expel the 44-year-old this week after he refused to resign following the guilty verdict.

However, lawyers for Ward - who plans to appeal his conviction - say they will seek an injunction, at a Supreme Court hearing on Thursday, to stop the independent member for Kiama from being forced out.

"He's got no shame," NSW Premier Chris Minns told local radio station 2GB on Tuesday.

He repeated calls for Ward to resign from state parliament, saying it's the "first and most obvious choice".

"It's an unconscionable situation to have someone who's currently sitting in jail in Silverwater, convicted of serious sexual offences, who is demanding to remain a member of parliament and continue to be paid," Minns said.

Opposition leader Mark Speakman joined calls for Ward to step aside.

"Every day he clings to his seat from a jail cell, taxpayers are footing the bill and the people of Kiama are left voiceless. It's not just wrong, it's offensive," the leader of the NSW Liberals - a party which Ward was formerly a part of - said.

In a statement after his conviction but before his bail was revoked, Ward said he was "absolutely shattered" by the jury's verdict and was spending time with his family.

"I am taking advice about next steps, but I can confirm that I have provided instructions to my legal team to prepare an appeal at the earliest opportunity," the statement read.

Ward resigned as a state government minister and from the Liberal Party when the accusations emerged in 2021, but refused to leave parliament and was re-elected as the member for Kiama in 2023.

The NSW government had previously considered voting to expel Ward - who has been a state MP since 2011 - but legal advice indicated it could risk prejudicing his trial.

If Ward is expelled from parliament, it would trigger a by-election in the south coast town of Kiama, with a possible vote within weeks.

Ward is due to be sentenced next month, for three counts of indecent assault and one count of rape.

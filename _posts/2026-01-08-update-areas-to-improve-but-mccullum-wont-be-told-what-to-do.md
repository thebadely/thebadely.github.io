Highlights: Australia beat England on day five to seal 4-1 Ashes win

Coach Brendon McCullum says he will not be told what to do but accepted there are "areas to improve" after England's Ashes defeat.

Australia's five-wicket victory in the fifth Test confirmed England's 4-1 series defeat - a result that has brought the futures of McCullum, captain Ben Stokes and director Rob Key into question.

The management of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), who said a review into the defeat is under way, are minded to allow McCullum and Key to continue but they must accept and enact change.

"I am not against assistance but have a firm belief in how to get the best out of these players," McCullum, 44, told BBC Test Match Special.

"I will look at it individually and say 'what could I have done better?'

"Am I for being told what to do? Of course I am not. But at the same time I'm not thinking there won't be areas to improve."

In an attempt to rid players of pressure, a relaxed environment has been a cornerstone of McCullum's England since he took over as Test coach at the start of 2022.

But on this tour, which began with a genuine feeling England could be competitive, England have appeared unserious with questions being raised about their preparation, training methods and an apparent lack of accountability for mistakes made on the field.

Their time playing golf and the amount of drinking on a mid-series trip to Noosa has also come into focus.

McCullum said: "When I took the job on I remember the situation England were in.

"I felt it was a great opportunity to use the resource, talent, support base and history that sits in English cricket to ensure the Test side, while there are challenges which are hitting the game all around the world with franchise cricket etc, are still able to get the best players possible who can get excited to come on tour.

"Over the last three and a half years with Stokesy and myself, our record is what it is.

"It has certainly improved from what it was. Whether it is at the levels we all want, probably not, but it doesn't mean we can't get there."

ECB chief executive Richard Gould, who has been in Australia in recent weeks, said a "thorough review" is "already under way".

"This will cover tour planning and preparation, individual performance and behaviours, and our ability to adapt and respond effectively as circumstances require," he said. 

"We will implement the necessary changes over the coming months."

While McCullum and Stokes remained forthright in a wish to carry on, Stokes said it was time for "honest truths" about the side.

"We started so well in the first couple of years and now we are eking downwards," he added.

"That is never a good place to be as a team. The time off after this is for reflection and honest truths. It needs to happen."

Stokes, whose side have only won three of their past 10 Tests and lost 11 of their past 15 away from home, suggested opposition have found them out.

"For a while, teams are working out how to operate against us as a team," he told TNT Sports.

"When we seem to get into a situation with the bat where everything looks easy, oppositions are doing a lot of the same things to us now. We need to work out what we do in those situations a lot better.

"We play too much 'three out of 10 cricket' in terms of the chances of it coming off. When you do that, the chances are it is not going to come off in your favour."

McCullum took over England's Test team in 2022 after their last Ashes defeat down under

The pair won 10 of their first 11 matches in charge, having taken over following a run of one victory in 17 Tests.

Despite that upturn, they have failed to win any of their major series.

They drew the 2023 home Ashes and last summer's series against India 2-2, and lost 4-1 in India in 2024. 

They lost this series at the earliest opportunity with defeats in the first three Tests.

"I am obviously disappointed with the outcome of the series," McCullum said. "As coach you have to put your hand up. 

"There are things we have got to look at over the next little while. I would love to carry on because I feel we have got steps to take, things to improve on.

"I feel like we have got the makings of a good cricket team. We haven't lived up to that down here but there are some good years in front in English cricket."

It has been recently reported that Families in Bradford are being urged to sign up for a council-run summer holiday activities and food programme.

The scheme - also known as the 'holiday hunger' programme - offers free meals and access to clubs for children who receive benefits-related free school meals or who have special educational needs.

Bradford Council, which provides the clubs with the support of government funding, said it was working with nearly 100 local organisations this summer.

Deputy leader Imran Khan said the programme had already had a "remarkable impact" on young people in the Bradford district and he hoped many more would benefit this year.

Among the providers is the Yorkshire Academy of Creative Arts and Dance, whose Creative Arts Summer Camp runs from 28 July to 23 August.

Artistic director Matthew Jay Pratt said the impact on young people from having access to the scheme was profound.

"We find that during summer, we have a very different audience who access our provisions," he said.

"These are often children and young people who don't usually access any sort of creative arts and dance; they just want to give it a try.

"We offer a safe, active, creative space where children and young people can freely express themselves."

He said the aim was to" boost confidence and resilience" among the young people, adding: "This isn't just arts and crafts - it's about supporting their emotional wellbeing."

The holiday activities and food programme started as a pilot in 2018 under the then Conservative-led government.

It was rolled out to councils after further successful pilots and was significantly expanded in 2021 following the pandemic, after calls for increased support for low-income families.

A campaign by footballer Marcus Rashford was widely regarded as having helped convince Ministers to expand the programme and invest hundreds of millions of pounds into it.

Khan said the scheme helped children stay active during the holidays, learn new skills, and make new friends in a safe and fun environment. 

"Plus, they get a nutritious meal every day and learn about healthy eating," he said.

"It is great for parents too, knowing their children are having fun in a safe, engaging environment and being well fed.

"I encourage families with eligible children to take advantage of this great offer and get their child involved this summer."

According to new developments, Padraig Harrington adds the Senior Open to his Open titles in 2007 and 2008.

Ireland's Padraig Harrington has become only the fifth player to win the Open and Senior Open after a three-stroke victory at Sunningdale.

The 53-year-old beat Justin Leonard and Thomas Bjorn as his final round of 67 took him to 16 under for the tournament.

Harrington joins Darren Clarke, Tom Watson, Gary Player and Bob Charles as the only men to win both editions of the Open.

He won the Open in back-to-back years in 2007 and 2008.

It is a third Senior major for Harrington, who also won the US Open in 2022 and in June this year.

He also finished tied for second at the Senior PGA Championship after missing out to Angel Cabrera by one stroke.

Northern Ireland's Clarke finished tied for 51st after he finished two over for the tournament.

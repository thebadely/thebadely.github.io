Let's dive into the details: Paul Dawson and Isaac Buckley-Ricketts scored as sixth-tier Macclesfield shocked Crystal Palace on Saturday

Non-league Macclesfield have been drawn at home to Premier League high-flyers Brentford in the FA Cup fourth round.

The National League North side beat holders Crystal Palace 2-1 on Saturday to record one of the biggest upsets in the history of the competition.

Either Salford City or Swindon of League Two will visit Manchester City, while new Chelsea boss Liam Rosenior will take his side to former club Hull City.

Premier League leaders and 14-time winners Arsenal will host 2013 winners Wigan at the Emirates, while Burnley host League One Mansfield Town.

There will be two all-Premier League ties with Newcastle travelling to Aston Villa and Liverpool, who beat Barnsley after the draw on Monday night, hosting Brighton.

The ties will be played across the weekend of 14-15 February.

It has been recently reported that The famous J35 TER number plate owned by the late Cornish comedy legend Jethro has sold for £30,500 at auction.

The personalised plate was the star of the online auction of his vehicles and agricultural machinery which ended on Thursday night.

The comedian, who died in 2021, ran a farm and a contracting business from his  base at Lewdown, near Okehampton, Devon.

He always used the number plate on his personal vehicle and it was even on the Toyota Land Cruiser that carried his coffin to his funeral at Truro Cathedral in 2022.

The viewing day for the dispersal sale of vehicles, farm equipment and other machinery attracted a large number of people but it was the number plate that drew the most interest.

Harvey Pile from Stags Auctioneers told BBC Radio Cornwall:  "When I was instructed to conduct the sale on behalf of the family I knew it would be quite a sought-after and special item to be selling but I did not expect it to be beyond £15,000 to £20,000.

"There was quite a prolonged bidding war between numerous people, it actually didn't close until 19:40 BST, travelling from £15,000 right up to £30,500 until somebody was finally victorious and now owns a piece of comedic history."

Mr Pile said he had no doubt the affection for Jethro had added to the interest in the sale.

"The origin of it is important and I think that's definitely helped us promote it and obviously helped the sale prices be very very healthy," he said.

Jethro, whose real name was Geoffrey Rowe, was born in St Buryan, Cornwall.

His popularity as a comedian grew during the 1980s and he made his first national appearance on the Des O'Connor show in 1990.

He later said that performance gave him a national profile and it led to other TV appearances and stage shows across the UK.

In 2001, he appeared on the Royal Variety Show and went on to become one of the biggest stars from Cornwall.

Jethro had stopped touring in 2020 after more than 50 years on the road - he died in December 2021 at the age of 73 after contracting Covid-19.

His funeral at Truro Cathedral in January 2022 was attended by hundreds of people, including fellow comedian and close friend Jim Davidson.

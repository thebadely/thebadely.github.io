Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Alex Callender starred in Wales' 21-12 win against Australia in Brisbane

Women's Rugby World Cup 2025: Scotland v Wales

Venue: Salford Community Stadium Date: Saturday 23 August Kick-off: 14:45 BST

Coverage: Live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer, BBC Sport Online and BBC Sounds

Co-captain Alex Callender is included in Wales' Rugby World Cup squad despite suffering a concerning ankle injury earlier this month.

The Harlequins back row limped off just four minutes into the second Test against Australia on 1 August before returning to the sideline on crutches.

Head coach Sean Lynn has included all 30 players he took on the summer tour, along with experienced centre Kerin Lake and uncapped Wales Under-20 captain Branwen Metcalfe. 

Kate Williams will share captaincy duties as she did in Australia, but the Wales camp has yet to confirm if Callender will be fit for the team's opener against Scotland in Manchester on 23 August.

Wales' also face the world's second best team Canada at the same venue on 30 August, before a reunion with former head coach Ioan Cunningham, who is now in charge of Fiji, in Exeter.

The top two teams in each of the four pools progress to the knock-out stages, with the final hosted at Twickenham on 27 September.

Metcalfe, 18, is the younger sister of full-back Nel Metcalfe and one of two pairs of sisters, along with prop Gwenllian Pyrs and lock Alaw Pyrs, to be selected in the squad. 

Wales hooker Carys Phillips is set to play in her fourth World Cup, while it will be a third outing for Hannah Jones, Jasmine Joyce-Butchers, Lleucu George, Kelsey Jones, Keira Bevan and Gwenllian Pyrs. 

It will be a first major tournament experience for Seren Lockwood, Katherine Baverstock and Tilly Vucaj, who all won their first caps in Australia.

Carys Cox, Courtney Keight, Alaw Pyrs, Maisie Davies, Molly Reardon, Nel Metcalfe, Jenni Scoble, Catherine Richards, Bryonie King and Meg Davies will also make their World Cup debuts.

There is no place in the squad for Natalia John, Hannah Bluck, Jenny Hesketh, Sian Jones or Robyn Wilkins, some due to injury.

"The Wales squad selected is a mix of experience and exciting young talent that have all proved they deserve the opportunity to play on the biggest stage of a World Cup," said Lynn, who celebrated his first win in the opening Australia Test since taking charge in March.

"As coaches, there were some tough calls on selection but this is the strongest squad we could have selected and we are looking forward to the challenge ahead of us. 

"For players, coaches and staff, this promises to be the pinnacle of all our careers and one that we are relishing. We know we are representing a proud rugby nation and we are determined to do the nation proud."

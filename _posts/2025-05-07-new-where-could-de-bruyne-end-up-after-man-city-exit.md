It has been recently reported that Kevin de Bruyne has won 16 trophies during a 10-year spell at Manchester City

Kevin de Bruyne's glorious decade at Manchester City is almost at an end - so what comes next for him?

The 33-year-old Belgian playmaker announced in April that he would be leaving at the end of the season.

He will depart as one of the Premier League era's greatest players, winning 16 trophies since joining City from Wolfsburg in 2015.

Unless he signs a short-term deal to stay for the Club World Cup, it appears De Bruyne has only four games remaining with City.

Where could the midfield pass master end up? Could be head to the USA, Saudi Arabia, Europe, or even into retirement? BBC Sport looks at the options...

'I've shown I can still play here' - is De Bruyne leaving too soon?

De Bruyne decision 'has to be emotionless'

A hop across the Atlantic to Major League Soccer (MLS) appears a strong option and the most likely at this stage.

MLS expansion club San Diego held 'discovery rights' on De Bruyne, meaning no other club could negotiate with him, but that was dropped.

There was a similar situation with Inter Miami, who relinquished their option to hold talks with De Bruyne, meaning he will not be teaming up with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez at the club part-owned by David Beckham.

If a move to the MLS transpires, then Chicago Fire are now in pole position to sign him as they have the first option for talks and sources say De Bruyne's representatives are to meet with club officials.

Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, Sadio Mane - just three of the globally famous stars that Saudi Arabia's wealthy Pro League has attracted in recent years.

The league's sporting director Michael Emenalo is the man who brought De Bruyne to Chelsea in 2012, although that move resulted in only nine competitive appearances in blue.

De Bruyne's representatives have previously spoken with clubs from Saudi Arabia, so contact in that direction has already been established.

But a move to the Middle East is unlikely at this stage as he is understood to prefer a move to the USA or Europe for family lifestyle reasons.

De Bruyne has claimed six Premier League titles with City

Highly improbable.

De Bruyne soaked up the acclaim of City's support at Etihad Stadium after scoring the winning goal against Wolves on 2 May and came out firing in front of the cameras afterwards.

"I have shown I can still play here," said De Bruyne. "Otherwise I don't do what I do these last four or five weeks.

"A lot of team-mates have spoken to me, they are sad also that I have to go. It goes like this in life, but the way I am performing is the way I should be."

The decision to release De Bruyne came from manager Pep Guardiola and technical director Txiki Begiristain, so a significant rethink and U-turn in planning would need to happen for him to stay.

De Bruyne is one of the Premier League's highest earners and it is unimaginable that City would offer an extension on his current Â£400,000-a-week terms.

Could he remain in the Premier League by joining another club?

Very few would be able to come close to matching those wages, but reports, external in April said Aston Villa had held internal discussions about a potential move.

"I'm open for anything because I have to look at the whole picture," De Bruyne has said., external

"I'm looking at sporting reasons, family and everything together and what makes the most sense for me and my family."

Last month, BBC Sport columnist Guillem Balague suggested on BBC Radio 5 Live's Euro Leagues podcast that De Bruyne could retire once his contract ends.

"He's only 33, but for whatever reason he's got 20 minutes per game in him, even if he starts games. That's been recognised by Man City for a while," said Balague.

"He's not stupid - the fact City haven't renewed his contract despite him considering the possibility of staying on is a sign of a player that has reached the top and can't go back to it any more."

But Belgian football expert Kristof Terreur disagreed.

"One thing he does have on his mind is the World Cup in 2026," said Terreur. "He wants to continue playing football, but all the juice is out of his body and he has become very injury prone, he said.

"He will pick a league [to play in] where there is less pressure and games where he might stay fit for the World Cup."

Here’s what you need to know: After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.

Here are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.

Jordan Pickford (Everton): I thought he had a good game. Massive occasion for Everton with the new stadium and new opening. The penalty save is one everyone will say is an easy save, but at that point Brighton are on the up and if they score I think they go on and win the game. It was one of those games where you need a big-game player and he stepped up and it was a great save.

Michael Kayode (Brentford): He was a monster against Aston Villa. His long throws, his tackling, interceptions, he was aggressive to shut down Morgan Rogers on more than one occasion. Exceptional performance from him and got Brentford off to their first win of the season.

Micky van de Ven (Tottenham): I thought Van de Ven was excellent. A clean sheet against Man City, a team that everyone thought would be flying and back to the way they were. He set the tempo. Three or four occasions where he set the press, he was really tight to his player, even times when he went from Haaland all the way to the goalkeeper. He's been a colossus under Thomas Frank.

Hjalmar Ekdal (Burnley): Huge game for Burnley. First game at home, you want to win against Sunderland who got a win last week and at the heart of it he was heading everything away and putting in them big blocks as well.

Jurrien Timber (Arsenal): Two goals, first start of the season, probably a little bit harsh last week to not get a start, but showed when they have a more attacking style he's going to play more games. He was excellent, again, a couple of goals for a right-back.

Bruno Guimaraes (Newcastle): Excellent even though he was on the losing team, was the heartbeat, made the tackles and scored the goal to get them back in the game. He was like the orchestra, he was making sure everybody was playing to his tune and everyone kept going and it was him that made Liverpool really sweat and worry. Losing Tonali and Joelinton, he was the one that made sure we'll kick on again. I thought he was fantastic.

Enzo Fernandez (Chelsea): Scored a goal and he's going to be the one that scores 10-12 goals because he just keeps creeping from midfield. Excellent running, excellent captain's performance. He was excellent, Chelsea were excellent and when Cole Palmer goes down, he's the one to take the lead and goes on again.

Jack Grealish (Everton): Jack was fantastic. It was great to see him smiling, great to see him playing with freedom, aspiring to try and get to this situation where Everton gave him the ball on all occasions and when he's there and he's playing and delivering  like he did, it was great to see him take somebody on as well. Two assists on the day. Him playing well is not only good for him but also England.

Brennan Johnson (Tottenham): He was fantastic again. He looks like he's going to have an unbelievable season because Kudus is going to take a lot of the focus of the teams coming from that right-hand side on that left foot. The pace and power he shows is unbelievable. That's two in two for Johnson. I thought he was excellent against Man City.

Joao Pedro (Chelsea): Goals, assists for Chelsea again, against a poor West Ham team. He looks really composed, he looks like he's meant to be at Chelsea. He could've had a few more if players had passed to him but a solid performance from him.

Viktor Gyokeres (Arsenal): The man of the moment: Victor Gyokeres. It was a massive game for him in terms of expectations, in terms of people wanting him to score, people wanting him to fail. Granted, it was against Leeds, but he's off the mark and he took his goals well. Was he exceptional, no, but I think with that level of pressure and expectations and, after Kai Havertz went down, can you be the guy to score the goals? And he stepped up and delivered, so you have to give him credit for that.

Thomas Frank (Tottenham): In the three games he's played, he's showed tactical awareness, tweaked it, changed it. He's made this team that Ange Postecoglou was complaining about - they were injured, they can't do this, they can't do that - he's played three different formations from the PSG game and the two games he's had in the Premier League, to now being in the position where we're looking at Spurs as a really solid outfit. They know what they're doing. They're adaptable against different teams. Keith Andrews is my close second with his first win for Brentford.

Jurrien Timber

After an injury-hit start to his Premier League career, Jurrien Timber has blossomed into one of Mikel Arteta's most consistent and reliable players.

At the weekend, the Dutch defender marked his first start of the new campaign with a superb forward-thinking display, netting two goals and providing an additional assist.

Courtesy of his goals and assist, Timber became just the second Arsenal defender in Premier League history to manage a triumvirate of goal involvements, after Spaniard Nacho Monreal. It was also Timber's first-ever brace in top-flight football, with both goals coming courtesy of the Gunners' trademark potent corners.

With a joint game-high four tackles made and another game-high three shots in total, Timber is well worth his place on this week's podium.

Joao Pedro

Joao Pedro was Brighton's standout performer in 2024-25, registering 16 goal involvements in the Premier League, more than any other Seagull.

The Brazilian has continued that fruitful form into 2025-26, kickstarting his Chelsea career with three goals in three games at the Club World Cup and getting amongst the goals in the Premier League at the weekend.

Against an admittedly lacklustre West Ham side, Joao Pedro netted the opening goal before going on to provide two more assists, only the second time the attacker had managed three goal involvements in a Premier League game, after doing so for Brighton against Tottenham in December 2023.

Against the Hammers, the Â£60m man also mustered a joint game-high three shots while he won more duels (9) and twice as many aerial duels (6) as any other player in the game.

Jordan Pickford

Everton christened the Hill Dickinson Stadium in perfect style, courtesy of a 2-0 win over Brighton. However, it could have been a very different outcome had it not been for a superb display from Jordan Pickford.

The England number one was kept busy all afternoon against a somewhat unlucky Brighton side, making four saves, the joint-most of any top-flight glovesman at the weekend.

One of those stops came from a late Danny Welbeck penalty, bringing Pickford's tally of Premier League spot-kick saves to eight, a figure bettered by only three other English keepers - David James (13), Rob Green (9) and Ben Foster (9).

Additionally, since the start of last season, only David Raya (15) has managed more shut-outs than the in-form Pickford (13).

Let's dive into the details: Ferguson scored the winner against Armenia in October

Manager Heimir Hallgrimsson says he is "positive" Evan Ferguson will be able to play some role in the Republic of Ireland's upcoming World Cup qualifiers despite an ankle issue. 

The forward - on loan at Roma from Brighton, who scored in the 1-0 win against Armenia in October, picked up the injury against Parma on 29 October. 

However, he is included in the 25-man squad for the final two group games that begin at home to Portugal on Thursday, 13 November (19:45 GMT) before a trip to Hungary on Sunday, 16 November (14:00 GMT).

"He is back on the grass after recovering from a knock," said Hallgrimsson.

"We would have called him in anyway to assess him and maybe have the option of playing him in the second game. 

"He is key to our goals and has been scoring for us. We'll assess him but we're positive he'll be ready."

Hallgrimsson's side go into the final round of matches in Group F sitting in third, one point behind Hungary who travel to Armenia in the first of their games, knowing qualification for the 2026 World Cup could be out of their grasp with a game to spare should they lose to runaway leaders Portugal.

Missing for that game will be Jayson Molumby and Ryan Manning through suspension, but both are included in the squad.

There is a return for Mark Sykes despite his club Bristol City revealing he would miss their next two games after sustaining a gash on his leg in Tuesday's 1-0 defeat by Blackburn Rovers.

With Callum O'Dowda out, Jimmy Dunne retains his place in the squad after coming in as a late replacement for the October internationals, while American-born 26-year-old Kevin O'Toole receives a call-up with the left-sided New York City player eligible through his grandfather.

However, there is no call for Celtic's Johnny Kenny - despite scoring three goals in his last two games, including the opener in the League Cup semi-final win over Rangers at the weekend - even though Hallgrimsson is without the injured Sammie Szmodics.

Hallgrimsson said Kenny would be the "next in line" for a call-up should Ferguson be ruled out of the fixtures.  

"He has been scoring and he looks lively. He has the confidence from his coach and he's a little bit different to the others," the former Iceland boss said.

"With the games that we have, we think the three strikers ahead of him would be picked before him at this stage.

"But we know if Evan isn't ready then he is the next in line."

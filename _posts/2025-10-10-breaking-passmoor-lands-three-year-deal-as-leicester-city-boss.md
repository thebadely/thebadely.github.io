Let's dive into the details: Rick Passmoor spent two years at WSL rivals West Ham United as assistant coach

Leicester City's women's team have announced former interim manager Rick Passmoor as their permanent head coach on a three-year deal.

He took charge in early September after the Foxes sacked Amandine Miquel shortly before the start of the season.

Leicester have earned four points from their first five Women's Super League matches this season and are 10th in the table.

"I am very privileged and very honoured to be at this club," Passmoor told the club's website. "I want to ensure we continue to progress and further establish ourselves in the WSL.

"There's history on the men's side, and we want to make sure we leave a legacy with Leicester Women."

Passmoor was confirmed as permanent manager on Friday afternoon on a contract until 2028.

At his news conference before the team's league fixture at Aston Villa on Sunday, 12 October (12:00 BST), Passmoor said he was aiming to improve Leicester's attack, with the side having scored just three WSL goals under his tenure.

"We are completely changing the philosophy, it will take time," he added. "We are against teams who have had the same managers for two or three years.

"We want to be comfortable in possession, relaxed and composed to create opportunities."

Before joining Leicester, Passmoor served as assistant manager at West Ham under the London side's boss Rehanne Skinner.

The former Notts County and Leeds United boss succeeded Miquel, who was sacked just 10 days before the start of the 2025-26 WSL season.

Frenchwoman Miquel, 41, led Leicester to a 10th-placed finish last season, with 20 points from 22 games - 10 clear of relegated Crystal Palace.

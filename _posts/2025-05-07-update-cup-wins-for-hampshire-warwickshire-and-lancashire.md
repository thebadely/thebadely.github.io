According to new developments, Fi Morris (left) and Ellie Threlkeld put on a match-clinching partnership of 85 for Lancashire

An unbeaten 111 from Somerset captain Sophie Luff was the platform for her side to enjoy a commanding 48-run victory over Warwickshire at Edgbaston in the One-Day Cup.

Luff's ton and 70 from Heather Knight helped them post 297-6 from their 50 overs.

Despite Sterre Kalis' 60 and 50 for skipper Georgia Davis, the hosts were bowled out for 249 in the 49th over as Somerset remain one point behind leaders The Blaze. 

Fi Morris hit a brilliant 90 not out off 76 balls to anchor Lancashire's successful chase of Surrey's 296-8 at Southport.

Alice Davidson-Richards had made 100 for the visitors, but Morris helped the Red Rose to win by five wickets with two overs to spare. 

In the day's other game, Hampshire cruised past Durham at Arundel with a seven-wicket victory as half-centuries from Maia Bouchier and Charli Knott saw them overhaul the visitors' 190-8 with 13.1 overs in hand.

After being asked to bat first, Somerset's top order provided a superb platform with Knight and Luff sharing 79 for the second wicket and then Luff adding 118 with Fran Wilson (37) for the third wicket.

Luff ended not out off 105 balls, although the final total would have been higher but for four late wickets from Emily Arlott.

Netherlands batter Kalis hit a breezy 60 off 49 balls to get the reply above the required rate, but Warwickshire were undermined by a middle-order collapse.

They slipped from 153-2 to 179-8 with Chloe Skelton and Alex Griffths taking two wickets apiece.

Captain Davis, batting at 10, put on 70 with Issy Wong but two wickets in three balls  ensured a fourth win in five games for Somerset. 

Heather Knight has scored 185 runs in four One-Day Cup games this season 

Having won the toss and opted to bat, Durham's hopes of a big score were soon under threat as Hampshire and England fast bowler Lauren Bell removed both openers inside the first seven overs, including New Zealand batter Suzie Bates.

From there, they struggled to build any momentum as Phoebe Turner top scored with 38 and had a highest partnership of only 42 between her and Bess Heath for the sixth wicket.

But Hampshire produced a disciplined bowling display, especially with spin, with five players sharing the wickets.

In reply, although Ella McCaughan was out for 11, a partnership of 93 between Bouchier (53) and Knott (58) did the bulk of the work.

Both fell in the fifties, but captain Georgia Adams and Rhianna Southby saw the chase home with 79 balls to spare as the southern county climbed to third.

 

Surrey decided to bat first at Trafalgar Road, but Kate Cross took wickets in her first two overs to leave them 10-2.

Danni Wyatt-Hodge was then out for 21, bringing Paige Scholfield and Davidson-Richards together.

They put on an impressive 143 for the fourth wicket before Scholfield was out for 87 off 82 balls.

But Davidson-Richards went on to three figures off 102 balls before she was out in the penultimate over.

Lancashire's opening pair put on 53 before Emma Lamb was caught behind off Alice Monaghan for 20.

Eve Jones went to her third half-century of the competition, to add to one century, but she was also dismissed by Monaghan for 50.

Australian Katie Mack hit 84 off 69 balls to keep the chase on course, but when she and Ailsa Lister, for a duck, fell in successive overs to make it 214-5, it was game on with Lancashire still needing 83.

But captain Ellie Threlkeld (25 not out) provided valuable support to Morris as the two batters got those runs with two overs to spare to record the Red Rose's third win of the competition as they jumped to fourth.

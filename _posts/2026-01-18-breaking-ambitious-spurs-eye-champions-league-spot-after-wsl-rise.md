Experts revealed that Martin Ho led Brann to the quarter-finals of the 2023-24 Women's Champions League

A year ago, Tottenham lived in the shadows of a Women's Super League relegation fight. 

Today, they sit level on points with third-placed Arsenal after collecting 23 from 12 matches and the two north London sides are separated only by goal difference. 

So this question does not feel outrageous: can Spurs secure a place in next season's Champions League with a top-three finish?

The club's transformation under Martin Ho, who took over last summer after Spurs finished second bottom in 2024-25, has been remarkable with few, if any, expecting them to be fighting at the top just past the midway point of the season. 

Ho's side are unbeaten in four games, a run that has included draws against the Gunners and Manchester United as well as wins over Aston Villa and Leicester City. 

Their upward trajectory continued on Sunday as they defeated the Foxes for the second time in a week - this time 3-0 to advance to the last 16 of the Women's FA Cup.

And the former United assistant does not want to restrict his side's ambitions.

"I don't want to put a ceiling on what we can achieve," said Ho, who took Norwegian side Brann to the quarter-finals of the 2023-24 Women's Champions League.

"As soon as you do that, you risk limiting yourself. We can achieve a lot through work ethic, behaviour and how we conduct ourselves on and off the pitch.

"I won't rule anything out, but I won't be unrealistic either. If we perform well, anything is possible." 

Tottenham currently sit fourth in the WSL after finishing second from bottom last season

Spurs have posted seven wins and two draws in 12 WSL games and have made their ambitions clear during the January transfer window. 

"I wouldn't have joined if the club's ambition didn't match mine," Ho said. 

"Since arriving, the ownership has invested heavily in the team - in players, staff, facilities and infrastructure.

"They want this team competing in Europe consistently and challenging for honours domestically. That takes time, but the support is there."

The club have signed Norway internationals Julie Blakstad and Signe Gaupset as well as Swedish duo Hanna Wijk and Matilda Nilden from BK Hacken. 

Meanwhile, highly rated Japanese forward Maika Hamano has joined on loan from defending champions Chelsea until June. 

Speaking on BBC Women's Football Weekly, former England forward Ellen White and ex-Scotland international Jen Beattie agreed Spurs' transfer business reflects a club trying to challenge the status quo. 

"They are in the race for Champions League spots for sure," Beattie said. 

"Why not? He doesn't want to put pressure on players and what you say internally and externally can be two different things. 

"Internally, they'll know quality they have. They can compete with anyone." 

White said: "Spurs have recruited really well and we're seeing a lot of players from Norway and Sweden. 

"With the physicality of those leagues, they will be up to speed in that aspect. It's something Ho will be fully aware of, being out there and working with a number of these players." 

Signe Gaupset made her international debut for Norway in 2024

Spurs pulled off a coup to sign 20-year-old Gaupset, who is widely regarded as one of the world's best young talents and worked with Ho at Brann. 

Blakstad, 24, spent two years at Manchester City from 2022 but only made 36 appearances and left on loan to Hacken before joining Hammarby.

"Gaupset had a lot of options and big teams wanting her but she said she wants to work with Ho and sees ambition," White said. 

"I'm excited to see Blakstad too. I just think it's smart recruitment, really exciting and adds more depth."

Gaupset impressed on her debut as Tottenham defeated Leicester 1-0 last Sunday to boost their Champions League hopes. 

"Her decision-making was spot on," Beattie said. 

"When you can get the player of the match in 60 minutes, it goes to show her reading of the game, finding passes in behind. She got it spot on and was brilliant." 

White added: "Gaupset seems to be years ahead of herself in her quality, her technical ability and football IQ.

"She was always there offering for ball, always moving, physically strong. She offers something different attacking wise for Spurs and is a really exciting talent."

And with belief growing, Spurs look wellâplaced to find out just how high their ceiling really is.

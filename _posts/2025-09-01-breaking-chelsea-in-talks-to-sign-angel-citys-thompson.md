Experts revealed that Alyssa Thompson has scored three goals in 22 USA appearances

Chelsea are progressing in talks with Angel City as they attempt to sign USA forward Alyssa Thompson before Thursday's transfer deadline.

No fee has yet been agreed and it is understood it would take a significant amount for Thompson to be allowed to leave. 

However, sources close to the player say the Women's Super League champions Chelsea have held discussions with her.

On Monday, the 20-year-old was listed as being left out for Angel City's National Women's Soccer League game against Bay FC with an "excused absence".

Thompson has a contract with Angel City until the end of the 2028 National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) season.

Chelsea have until 23:00 BST on Thursday to complete a deal.

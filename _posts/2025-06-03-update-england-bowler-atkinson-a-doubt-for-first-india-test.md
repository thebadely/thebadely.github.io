Experts revealed that Atkinson has taken three five-wicket hauls in his 12 Tests

Bowler Gus Atkinson is a doubt for the first Test against India later this month because of a right hamstring strain - adding to England's injury concerns among their seamers.

The 27-year-old was injured during the one-off Test against Zimbabwe last month and was subsequently ruled out of the ongoing one-day international series against West Indies.

It had been hoped the paceman would be fit for the series opener against India at Headingley on 20 June but it is understood he is struggling to regain fitness.

England are already without Mark Wood and Olly Stone, while Jofra Archer's potential return to red-ball cricket has been delayed by a thumb injury.

Chris Woakes is expected to play for England Lions against India A this week as he continues his comeback from an ankle injury, while Brydon Carse has recovered from a foot injury to play in the three ODIs against West Indies.

Essex bowler Sam Cook, who made his international debut in the win against Zimbabwe, and Durham's Matthew Potts would be candidates to play in Atkinson's absence.

Another is Nottinghamshire seamer Josh Tongue. He took two wickets against Zimbabwe and could be added to the Lions squad to play India A this week in an attempt to maintain rhythm.

Atkinson has quickly become a senior member of England's attack following the retirements of Stuart Broad and James Anderson.

He has played in 12 of England's 13 Tests since making his debut at the start of last summer and has taken 55 wickets in that time - the most of any bowler in the world.

Test captain Ben Stokes had been considering playing for the Lions in the four-day game which starts on Friday in Northampton as he manages his return to bowling after hamstring surgery but is not expected to feature.

England will likely name their Test squad within the next week. 

All-rounder Jacob Bethell is set to be recalled having missed the Zimbabwe Test at the Indian Premier League, setting up an intriguing selection decision between the 21-year-old and vice-captain Ollie Pope.

According to new developments, US President Donald Trump has attacked Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) shortly after it named its new chief executive and as it undergoes a divisive rebranding.

Trump said on his Truth Social platform on Monday that JLR was in "absolute turmoil" after its boss resigned "in disgrace". The president also called the firm's recent marketing campaign "stupid" and "woke".

Earlier, JLR said PB Balaji, the finance chief of its parent company Tata Motors, will take over as its chief executive in November. He will be JLR's first Indian CEO.

Adrian Mardell, who announced his retirement last week, led the company's controversial moves to ditch Jaguar's iconic cat logo and focus on producing electric cars.

On Monday, Trump compared Jaguar with US clothing brand American Eagle, another company making headlines for a viral marketing campaign.

Shares in American Eagle jumped after launching controversial advertisements for its jeans with actress Sydney Sweeney, best known for her role in TV series Euphoria.

Trump said the American Eagle campaign was the "'HOTTEST' ad out there" and praised Sweeney, after reports surfaced that she is a registered Republican.

He added: "On the other side of the ledger, Jaguar did a stupid, and seriously WOKE advertisement, THAT IS A TOTAL DISASTER!"

"Who wants to buy a Jaguar after looking at that disgraceful ad."

Mr Balaji will move to Jaguar from his role managing the finances of India's largest car manufacturer and JLR's owner, Tata Motors.

His arrival will come at time of major change for the business, including the launch of its first all-electric range in 2026.

The unveiling of its new electric concept car last year divided opinion.

Some on social media said the new Type 00 car was "exciting" and "absolutely stunning", while others called it "rubbish" and told Jaguar's designers to "go back to the drawing board".

As part of its rebranding, Jaguar rolled out an advert showing brightly dressed models posing in a hot pink, desert-like terrain but without any cars or the brand's familiar logo being shown.

The clip drew widespread criticism as it signalled a major shift away from Jaguar's usual style and target audience.

Like other carmakers outside the US, JLR is also dealing with the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs policies.

In July, the company announced plans to cut 500 management jobs in the UK.

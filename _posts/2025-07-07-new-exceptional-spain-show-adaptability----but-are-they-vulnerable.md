Spain thrash Belgium as they reach the Euro 2025 quarter-finals

Two games, six points, 11 goals - Spain are making their mark at Euro 2025.

After a convincing opening five-goal win over Portugal and a 6-2 thrashing of Belgium, La Roja are through to the knockout stage in Switzerland.

As world champions and the top-ranked side in the tournament, Spain already had a target on their back - now they have underlined why they are favourites.

"It'll take something special to outdo them or get a win over them," ex-Scotland captain Rachel Corsie told BBC Radio 5 Live.

"Spain deserve all the credit they've had so far. It's a daunting task for whoever has to face them as the tournament progresses. 

"It's a Spanish side that are nothing short of exceptional."

Former England forward Eni Aluko told ITV: "Spain are the team to beat.

"They want to complete football. They are World Cup champions, Nations League - they want to win this Euros because they have not done that yet."

Portugal offered little resistance in Spain's Group B opener, but Belgium proved a different challenge, twice equalising after going behind.

But each time the Red Flames responded, Spain replied instantly to restore their lead and regained complete control when Esther Gonzalez netted their third.

The rest of the game was spent largely in Belgium's half, with Mariona Caldentey, Claudia Pina and Alexia Putellas scoring in the final half an hour to round off a successful evening for Spain in Thun.

After having 12 shots in a hard-fought first half, Montse Tome's side stepped up a gear after the break to take their shot tally to 33.

"They have a bit of everything," Corsie said. "They have players that are dynamic, they have players that are exceptionally talented individually, one v one."

Their second-half performance left Belgium manager Elisabet Gunnarsdottir saying she "wanted to cry" when she entered the dressing room.

"I really believed in what we were doing and loved seeing my players give everything they had," Gunnarsdottir said.

"They [Spain] understand the game on a different level to anything we will see at this tournament.

"They're so good about making decisions around the box. If you give them time around the box, or give them space, they use it."

With Patri Guijarro dominating play from the base of Spain's midfield, and Putellas and either Aitana Bonmati or 18-year-old Vicky Lopez in front, Spain are able to camp outside the opposition's box.

And if they fail to squeeze the ball through to one of their forward players, they are ready to have a go themselves.

"Patri underneath that midfield two, she instructed everything - I thought she was excellent," Corsie said.

The worry for Spain's rivals? Both Tome and Putellas said in their post-match media conferences that Spain had "room for improvement". 

Former Republic of Ireland goalkeeper Emma Byrne agreed on ITV, saying: "I still believe there is a lot more to come from Spain. We haven't seen the best from them in a while, even though they are winning.

"They have got the quality, you can certainly see that, but I still don't think we've seen Spain in full flow yet. We've seen it in moments. 

"There is more to come and that's the scary thing."

With seven different names on the scoresheet across their two games, Spain have shown they are not reliant on one player.

While Spain are known for their short, intricate passing and high possession count, they took a different approach for their second goal, with captain and centre-back Irene Paredes showing up to head home a set-piece.

That was also seen by Caldentey's long-range ball over the top for Putellas' goal against Portugal.

"Spain have added a different style by being able to go more direct. When sides go 5-4-1 it is very difficult to break down, so Spain adding a long ball is an extra thing to win competitions," former Spain midfielder Vicky Losada said.

Byrne added: "I am interested to see how Spain change their game. We are so used to them keeping possession and nice passes - but now they have a target in the box."

Spain have shown a similar approach in both group games

So, are Spain unstoppable? The task for their opponents is to find and crack any weaknesses Tome's side may have.

Belgium, at least, showed their defence is not invincible. 

Justine Vanhaevermaet's header from a corner proved there are opportunities from set-pieces, while a counter-attacking ball over the top was all Belgium needed to put Hannah Eurlings through on goal for their second.

"Their primary strengths are in possession and going forward. Today, Belgium didn't have too much of the ball and they managed to create goals and chances, which on a different day could've been more," Corsie said.

"That will give teams and nations that they'll face later on a bit of hope, and the way you can see they can be vulnerable.

"It's understanding that when you do win the ball there's a lot of place to play with if you can find that initial combination to break their press. 

"You need two passes to break it, and if you can do that, that's where Belgium were able to find success."

Spain, after all, have been beaten recently. England triumphed against them in the Nations League this year, and they lost to Brazil and Germany in a disappointing Olympic campaign last summer.

"For Spain, they will be disappointed that they've given Belgium opportunities from very little, because the other teams look at that and potentially use that to their advantage," Corsie added.

"Spain have shown their cards on that front and will have to be better when they face better nations later on."

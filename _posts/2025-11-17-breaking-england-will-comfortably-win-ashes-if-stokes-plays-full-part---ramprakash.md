According to new developments, England have not won a Test in Australia since their successful 2010-11 tour 

England will beat Australia "quite comfortably" in the Ashes if captain Ben Stokes is fit enough to play all five Tests, says former batter Mark Ramprakash.

The series begins on Friday in Perth with England looking to win the urn down under for the first time since 2010-11.

Stokes has recovered from a shoulder issue to play but has missed matches in each of England's past three series because of injuries.

Ramprakash, who also worked with Stokes during his time as England batting coach, pointed to the all-rounder's ability to balance the side but also his leadership.

"He seems to really connect with his team-mates," Ramprakash told BBC Radio 5 Live's on their Ashes preview show. 

"He knows how difficult it is to be an international cricketer. 

"He gives them his full backing and has great empathy to understand the ups and downs."

Stokes' most recent injury ruled him out of the fifth Test against India in the summer, which the tourists won to draw the series 2-2.

He also missed a Test in Pakistan last winter after tearing his hamstring in the summer and limped out of a match in New Zealand in December having repeated the injury.

"If he is not in the middle to make those decisions, to know when to back his bowlers, when to attack, that is a massive vacuum," Ramprakash said.

"If Ben Stokes plays these five Tests then I think England win and win quite comfortably."

Stokes has been the focus of the hostilities from the Australian media since arriving in Perth, with one local paper describing him as "England's Cocky Captain Complainer".

Stokes and some other England players were also pictured on the golf course on Monday - an apparent attempt to question the side's preparations.

Stokes' county coach, Western Australian Ryan Campbell, criticised the headlines and questioned the logic in targeting Stokes before the series.

"I got a bit shirty about it," Durham coach Campbell said. "I want WA to put on a good show. I don't want that stuff.

"Everyone wants to say something smart. A lot of it you have to take with a pinch of salt.

"There is two blokes I wouldn't have a crack at - that is Ben Stokes and Joe Root. 

"They are the calmest and take it on board to give back in spades. Pick your targets a bit better."

Stokes has already produced a number of famous Ashes moments, starting with a century in his second Test against Australia in Perth during the 2013-14 tour.

The most famous was his extraordinary match-winning century at Headingley in 2019 and spinner Jack Leach - his final batting partner that day - said he was inspired by Australia's aggression during that knock.

"[David] Warner had been going at him," Leach said.

"He said [at the end of day three] 'I am not walking off that pitch until we have won the game' and was really fired up. Obviously he ended up doing it."

Leach added: "[Root] does it in a quieter way. He is, deep down, pretty motivated for this. 

"There has been a lot of chat about him never scoring a hundred in Australia so he is going in with a lot to prove."

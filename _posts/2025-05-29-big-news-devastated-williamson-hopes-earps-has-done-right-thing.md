'Sad' Wiegman and 'devastated' Williamson on Earps' retirement

England captain Leah Williamson said she hopes Mary Earps' retirement from international football is "the best decision for her".

The Paris St-Germain goalkeeper announced she had played her last game for England on Tuesday, just five weeks before the start of Euro 2025.

The timing of her decision has received criticism but asked if she thought Earps' choice was a selfish one, Williamson said: "I think to arrive at that decision must be one of the hardest things in your career. 

"She is a human first and I hope Mary is OK and it's the best decision for her. We will miss her."

Williamson, who celebrated winning the Women's Champions League with Arsenal on Saturday, added: "I spoke to Mary, she's one of my closest friends in football - so I'm devastated, just because I love her, I love being her team-mate.

"I think the way that she wears the England shirt is an example to us all so I'm very sad that those memories are not going to continue in an England shirt.

"But for her, she thinks this is the best thing, and I'll support her in that always."

Manager Sarina Wiegman said she was "really disappointed and sad" about Earps' decision - because she "wanted her in my team".

She would not disclose details on the conversations she shared with Earps or when she first knew of the goalkeeper's intentions to step down.

However, speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, Wiegman admitted the news came as a "shock" to the players.

Earps played 53 games over eight years for England, winning the 2022 Euros, 2023 Women's Finalissima and helping them reach the 2023 World Cup final.

The 32-year-old claimed the Fifa Best Goalkeeper award for two successive years but had recently lost her England starting place to Chelsea's Hannah Hampton.

"That must have been a really hard decision for her and so it is for us," added Wiegman.

"Of course, I have a couple of conversations which I don't want to share here because that's between us. It's hard, I find it hard, and it's hard for her at the same time.

"She has done such a great job for England. She has made a massive difference and we've had an incredible journey so far. I really cherish that.

"It's emotional because we also have a relationship and we've had such a massive journey together with lots of highs and, of course, some lows too.

"That's what makes it really hard. But we have to move on and we don't have time now to celebrate because we're going into the Euros."

When asked if she tried to convince Earps to stay, Wiegman added: "She knows I want her in the team, so of course, we talked about that."

Earps elevated levels of goalkeeping in England

Earlier this week, Chelsea captain Millie Bright withdrew from the England squad for their upcoming Nations League matches to take an extended break and allow a period of recovery.

England welcome Portugal to Wembley on Friday (19:45 BST), before travelling to Barcelona to face Spain on Tuesday (18:00 BST).

Bright, 31, who led Chelsea to a unbeaten domestic season and won the Treble, said she is "mentally and physically" at her limits and needs a break.

Wiegman did not confirm if she will return in time for the Euros but says she hopes Bright can "take the time that will help her settle again in time".

"She has to take care of herself. We are in conversations and I don't know where that gets to," added Wiegman.

"We'll stay in contact and I hope she feels better soon, but I don't know that yet at the moment.

"We have people around who can give that support. The demands on the game, on and off the pitch, has increased a lot. We have to adapt and that's not always easy."

Williamson, who started every game alongside Bright at Euro 2022, said it was a "brave thing" for the Chelsea defender to speak out about.

"I think for anybody to speak out about mental health is a brave thing to do. I think it encourages other people to do the same," said Williamson.

"She's leading by example. I've given Millie a bit of space, when somebody is in that head space. But naturally, any support that she needs and anything that she needs from the team, we will be there to give it to her."

As well as Earps' retirement and Bright's withdrawal, there was a further blow for England this week when young Tottenham defender Ella Morris suffered an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury after receiving her first senior call-up.

The Football Association said they would continue to support 22-year-old Morris, who suffered the injury in training, throughout her recovery.

"That is awful. She came in and did really well. [There was] no contact and unfortunately she tore her ACL," said Wiegman. 

"She's devastated, we're devastated and of course we wish her a good rehab, but that was kind of a shock that that happened."

Elsewhere, Wiegman confirmed Manchester United defender Millie Turner's hopes of making the Euros squad are over after she fractured her foot last week.

United midfielder Ella Toone and Arsenal forward Alessia Russo are also unavailable to face Portugal due to minor calf injuries.

There was a more positive update regarding Chelsea forward Lauren James, while Wiegman confirmed team-mate Hampton will be England's number one goalkeeper going into the Euros.

On James, she said: "She's in [recovery] still. She's in a good place, doing really well. We want - and she wants too - to get her back for the Euros.

"So far she has ticked the boxes that she needs to tick and we're just progressing her. We just hope that she keeps moving forward and she can join us later on."

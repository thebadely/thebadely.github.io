Let's dive into the details: Archie Goodburn is the Scottish 50m breaststroke record holder

Scottish National Open Swimming Championships

Venue: Royal Commonwealth Pool, Edinburgh Date: 27-29 June 

Coverage: Live on the BBC Sport website, app and iPlayer.

Archie Goodburn has won gold in the 100m breaststroke at the Scottish Swimming Championships a year on from being diagnosed with brain cancer.

The 24-year-old from University of Edinburgh held off the challenge of Stirling University's Rafe Dobson in a comfortable one minute 2.42 seconds at Edinburgh's Royal Commonwealth Pool. 

Having been runner-up at 50m at the British Championships in April, Goodburn went into the race as strong favourite as he continues to train for this summer's World University Games and next year's Commonwealths in Glasgow.

He will also be aiming to retain the Scottish 50m breaststroke crown this weekend.

Meanwhile, Aberdeen University's Faye Rogers lowered her own S10 200m butterfly world record by more than half a second to 2:18.24 as she took bronze in the able-bodied final.

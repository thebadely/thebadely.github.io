It has been recently reported that The Guardian leads with what it calls "an escalation of tensions" between Labour and Unite, after the union suspended Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner over the bin strikes in Birmingham.

The paper says that it is a sign of how bad relations between the two sides have become.

According to the i Paper, they have hit their "lowest point to date", while the Daily Mail says the row has sparked a "political civil war".

In its leader column, the Sun urges the government to tell the unions who is in charge, "or end up in the dustbin of history".

Another union - the British Medical Association - is the focus of the Times' front page.

A YouGov survey commissioned by the paper suggests that just 36% of the public support a strike by BMA members, while 49% oppose it.

The report quotes medical leaders as saying resident doctors may never recover the trust of patients if the action goes ahead. 

The concerns are echoed in The Daily Telegraph, which says the plans are causing a "generational rift" between resident doctors and consultants.

Plans by the chancellor to launch a "concierge service" for international investors are reported in the Financial Times.

It says Rachel Reeves will use her Mansion House speech next week to support financial services companies, as she "looks to get on the front foot".

But shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride uses an article in the Daily Express to criticise what he calls Labour's "incompetence" on the economy, after figures showed output shrank for the second month in a row.

The Daily Telegraph reports that 15 water companies are introducing trials which will see some customers charged more during the summer.

It says the surge pricing schemes, using smart meters, aim to cut water usage and prevent hosepipe bans.

"Splash and burn" is the headline in the Daily Mirror, as it urges people to take care in the summer's third heatwave.

According to the i Paper, households could be offered a way to help cool down.

It reports that the government is considering extending grants for heat pumps to cover air conditioning as well.

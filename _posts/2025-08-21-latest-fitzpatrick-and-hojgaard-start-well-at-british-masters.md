English Ryder Cup hopeful Matt Fitzpatrick carded a five-under 67 to sit one shot behind joint leaders Thomas Aiken, Matthias Schwab, Li Haotong and Marcel Siem after the opening round of the British Masters.

There was also a strong start from another Englishman in Matt Wallace, who opened with four birdies in the first five holes and finished alongside Scotland's Ewen Ferguson in a group of five players on four under.

Fitzpatrick, the 2022 US Open champion, said: "This week is another opportunity to play well."

Despite making what he described as "a bit of a ropey start", Fitzpatrick, who is hoping to earn a call-up for next month's Ryder Cup, said he ultimately "played really solid".

"It really felt like I've hit the ball well and done everything right," he added.

Denmark's Rasmus Hojgaard is the only player who can overtake Ireland's Shane Lowry - who is playing at the Tour Championship, a non-qualifying event - to clinch the sixth and final automatic spot in Europe's team for the Ryder Cup.

Hojgaard posted a 69 to sit in a group of five on three under that includes his twin brother Nicolai.

"I get reminded of it [the Ryder Cup permutation] every day at the moment," said Rasmus Hojgaard.

He will earn a place in Luke Donald's team if he finishes in a tie for 29th with one other player or better, as he seeks the 13.7 points he needs.

Hojgaard, who picked up two birdies on the front and back nine, with his only bogey arriving at the fifth hole after a wayward approach to the green, added:  "You can't just forget about it.

"I try to focus on 'what can I do to try and put myself in position to have a chance of winning this golf tournament?', and that's taking it hole by hole and do my best.

"If it happens, it would be great, but I don't try and put too much energy into it."

The tournament on the Belfry's Brabazon course is the final qualifying event for the biennial contest between Europe and the United States, which is being staged for the 45th time next month.

The showpiece will be held from 26-28 September at Bethpage Black in New York.

DeChambeau & Rose qualify for Ryder Cup - who else is in?

Fellow Ryder Cup hopeful Fitzpatrick mixed seven birdies with two bogeys as he continued to make his case for inclusion by Donald, as Europe aim to retain the trophy away from home for the first time since 2012.

"It means the world to be a part of it," said Fitzpatrick. "Outside of winning a major, it is normally the first thing on a goal sheet at the start of a Ryder Cup year.

"We have got a great opportunity to do something we have not done in a while and obviously to be a part of that would be special."

Donald is due to announce his six captain's picks on 1 September.

However, it is far from certain who he will select, with Jon Rahm, Ludvig Aberg, Sepp Straka and England's Fitzpatrick, Wallace, Aaron Rai, Marco Penge and Harry Hall all likely to be under consideration.

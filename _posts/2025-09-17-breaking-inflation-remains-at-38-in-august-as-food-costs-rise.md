Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Inflation in the year to August remained at 3.8%, according to official figures, after food costs continued to rise.

The pace of price rises matched the inflation rate in July but as some costs such as airfares dropped, food was more expensive with cheese, fish and vegetable prices all rising.  

The data emerged as the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee meets to discuss interest rates ahead of an announcement on Thursday.  

Inflation remains above the Bank's 2% target but the central bank is not expected to cut borrowing costs.

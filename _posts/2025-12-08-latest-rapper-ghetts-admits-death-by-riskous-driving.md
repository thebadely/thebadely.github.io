Experts revealed that Award-winning rapper Ghetts has admitted killing a young man in a hit-and-run collision in north-east London.

The grime artist, whose real name is Justin Clarke-Samuel, failed to stop after his BMW hit Nepali student Yubin Tamang, 20, in Ilford, north-east London, on 18 October.

Police said the rapper was driving over 60mph in a 30mph zone, and hit Mr Tamang who was crossing the road. 

Clarke-Samuel, 41, from Woodford, east London, pleaded guilty to causing Mr Tamang's death by dangerous driving, and a second charge of dangerous driving on the same day. He also faces two further charges which are driving while over the legal alcohol limit and dangerous driving.

The fatal collision happened at about 23:30 BST, where Mr Tamang was hit as he was crossing the road on Redbridge Lane, Ilford, north-east London.

The second charge of dangerous driving that he admitted to, related to being behind the wheel of his BMW M5 in Tavistock Place and other London roads in Camden, Islington and Hackney on the same day.

Police attended the defendant's address in Woodford early the next day.

The black BMW, registered and insured in the defendant's name, was significantly damaged, police said.

Clarke-Samuel is due to be sentenced on 12 February, when the two other charges will also be dealt with, the court said.

The first is a charge of causing death by careless driving when over the limit for alcohol. It is alleged he was over the prescribed limit as he drove with 119 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath on 18 October.

The second, a dangerous driving charge, relates to an allegation that he dangerously drove a BMW M5 on Worcester Crescent and other roads in Redbridge, east London, on the same day.

Mr Tamang was an only child and his parents had sent him to the UK to receive an education.

He died in hospital two days after being knocked down.

Clarke-Samuel, who appeared via videolink from Pentonville prison, is currently in custody and the judge told him to expect a jail term, the length of which has yet to be determined.

He was also disqualified from driving, but the length of the ban is also still to be decided.

Ghetts is a Mercury Prize-nominated grime MC, rapper and songwriter who has had high profile musical collaborations with major acts including Stormzy, Ed Sheeran and Skepta.

He won the Best Male Act at the Mobo Awards in 2021 and received the Mobo Pioneer award in 2024 for his "significant contribution to British black culture".

He has also performed at Glastonbury multiple times including in 2024, and featured in the Netflix superhero series Supacell.

After the hearing, Det Insp Mark Braithwaite from the Met said "split-second decisions behind the wheel can have devastating, life-changing consequences".

He added: "Our thoughts and sympathies remain with Yubin's family.

"While nothing can undo their loss, today's two guilty pleas mark a step toward justice.

"We hope this brings them some measure of comfort."

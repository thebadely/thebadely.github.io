Here’s what you need to know: A programme providing school holiday clubs for thousands of children in Cornwall has been extended.

The Time2Move holiday programme supports families with activities and healthy food for children aged between five and 16, and is fully funded for those eligible for benefits-related free school meals, the government has confirmed.

The government announced a three-year extension for the scheme, as part of a £600m investment nationally.

The programme is run by Active Cornwall, which brings together providers across the county, and said £8m had been invested in it since 2021.

Tim Marrion, partnership manager at Active Cornwall said: "We know that school holidays can bring particular challenges for families on lower incomes and children can face triple inequalities of social isolation, poor diet and low levels of physical activity over the holiday periods. 

"Through our Time2Move programme we make a real difference for over 12,000 children and their families each year, so this funding extension is very welcome news".

The programme is fully-funded by the Department for Education and is known nationally as the Holiday Activities and Food Programme.

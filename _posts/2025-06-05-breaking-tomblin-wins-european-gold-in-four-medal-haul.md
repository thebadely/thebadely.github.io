According to new developments, Tomblin is now a two-time European champion

Ranjuo Tomblin became men's solo technical champion as he won four medals and Great Britain secured six medals in total at the European Artistic Swimming Championships in Madeira.

Having won the men's solo free title at last year's competition - becoming the first British male to win a European artistic swimming title - Tomblin took gold in the solo technical with a score of 234.4225 points.

That gave the 19-year-old a 1.7966-point advantage over silver medallist Filippo Pelati, with bronze going to Spain's Dennis Gonzalez Boneu.

Tomblin picked up bronze in this year's solo free event, and won a further two medals in the mixed competitions.

Taking part in their first championship together, Tomblin and Olympic silver medallist Izzy Thorpe won silver in the mixed duet technical event.

He also partnered with Holly Hughes to win bronze in the mixed duet free. 

Having previously been part of the multi-discipline European Aquatics Championships, the competition was a stand-alone event for the first time this year.

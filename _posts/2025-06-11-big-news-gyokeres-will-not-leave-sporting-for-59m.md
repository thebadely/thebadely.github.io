Experts revealed that Viktor Gyokeres has scored 15 goals in 26 games for Sweden

Sporting have not received an offer for striker Viktor Gyokeres and there is no 'gentleman's agreement' for him to leave for Â£59m, says club president Frederico Varandas.

Sweden international Gyokeres, 27, has been heavily linked with Manchester United and Arsenal after scoring 97 goals in 102 matches during two seasons in Portugal.

He has a 100m euro (Â£85m) release clause in his contract.

It has been widely reported that, after staying at Sporting last summer, Gyokeres and Sporting agreed he could leave for 70m euros (Â£59m) this summer.

However, Varandas said the club's only promise to Gyokeres was that they would not demand his full release clause.

"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for 60m euros plus 10m euros because I never promised that," Varandas said.

"To this day Sporting has not had an offer for Gyokeres - neither today nor last season."

Gyokeres spent three seasons with Coventry City in the Championship before joining Sporting under Ruben Amorim.

Manchester City director of football Hugo Viana was sporting director at Sporting last summer, when Gyokeres' agent sought assurances about his leaving if a suitable offer arrived.

"One of the agent's biggest concerns was whether we would demand the termination clause," said Varandas.

"He wanted to guarantee certain things. And what was agreed? That Sporting would not demand a release clause now.

"For one reason: he was going to be 27 years old and no player leaves Portugal at 27 for 100m euros or 90m euros.

"In that same meeting the agent wanted to anchor the exit to a value. I said this sentence: 'It's not worth us setting a value because I don't know what will happen in a year's time. I don't know if it will be 40m euros, 60m euros or 80m euros. What I can guarantee is that I will not demand 100m euros.'"

Should Arsenal target Gyokeres or Sesko?

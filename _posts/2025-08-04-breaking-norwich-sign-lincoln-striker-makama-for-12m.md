Experts revealed that Jovon Makama started his youth career at Derby County

Norwich City have completed the signing of striker Jovon Makama from Lincoln City for a fee of Â£1.2m.

The 21-year-old has joined the Championship club on a three-year contract, with an option for a further two years.

The fee is a club record for League One Lincoln, eclipsing the Â£750,000 they reportedly received from Bolton Wanderers for Scottish midfielder Ethan Erhahon last month.

Makama's arrival is part of new Norwich head coach Liam Manning's rebuild at Carrow Road following the departures of forwards Borja Sainz and Jonathan Rowe, to Porto and Marseille respectively.

Since he made his debut for the Imps aged 18, Makama has scored 15 goals in 97 appearances, but was left out of their squad for the 2-0 opening-game home win over Reading last Saturday as talks continued.

Nottingham-born Makama was originally part of the youth set-up at Derby County before he joined Lincoln in 2020, and has also had loan spells at non-league Gainsborough Trinity and Brackley Town.

Norwich begin their Championship campaign with a home fixture against Millwall on Saturday, 9 August.

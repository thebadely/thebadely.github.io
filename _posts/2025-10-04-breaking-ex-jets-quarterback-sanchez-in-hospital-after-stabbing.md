Hereâ€™s what you need to know: Mark Sanchez has worked as a pundit for Fox Sports since 2021

Former NFL quarterback Mark Sanchez is in a stable condition in hospital after being stabbed in Indianapolis, and has been arrested for his role in the incident.

The 38-year-old American, who was the fifth overall pick in the 2009 NFL Draft for the New York Jets, was in Indianapolis to commentate on Sunday's game between the Colts and the Las Vegas Raiders for Fox Sports.

In a statement on Saturday, the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department said it was investigating a "physical disturbance" involving two adult males "resulting in one man receiving lacerations and the other sustaining injuries consistent with stab wounds".

In a second statement, police said Sanchez remained in hospital but had been arrested for "battery with injury, unlawful entry of a motor vehicle and public intoxication". 

Fox Sports said: "Mark Sanchez was injured in Indianapolis on Saturday and is currently recovering in the hospital in stable condition. 

"We are deeply grateful to the medical team for their exceptional care and support. Our thoughts and prayers are with Mark, and we ask that everyone please respect his and his family's privacy during this time."

In a post on X, the New York Jets said: "Sending our thoughts and love to Mark Sanchez and his family. Hoping for a speedy recovery, 6."

In his five seasons with the Jets, where he wore the number six, Sanchez guided them to two consecutive AFC Championship Game appearances.

Across his 10-year career - which also included spells at the Philadelphia Eagles, the Dallas Cowboys, the Chicago Bears and the Washington Commanders - he threw for 15,357 yards with 86 touchdowns and 89 interceptions.

After retiring in 2019, he started a broadcasting career with ESPN before moving to Fox two years later.

Sanchez played for the Jets from 2009 to 2014

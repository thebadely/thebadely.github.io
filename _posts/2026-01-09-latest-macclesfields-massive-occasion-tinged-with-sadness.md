It has been recently reported that Macclesfield have played three games since Ethan McLeod died

It is the stuff of dreams for the lowest-ranked team left in the FA Cup to take on the holders in the third round. When Macclesfield host Crystal Palace on Saturday it will be one of the biggest days in their recent history, but one also tinged with sadness.

On 16 December, Silkmen forward Ethan McLeod died in a car accident while travelling back from Macclesfield's National League North match at Bedford Town.

Rather than travel on the team bus back to Cheshire, McLeod was driving himself back to the Midlands after the 2-1 victory in which he was an unused substitute.

The rest of the squad were held up in gridlocked traffic after the crash on the M1, but it wasn't until the next day they learned their team-mate was involved.

Macclesfield's first game after McLeod's death was postponed, but the club have played three league matches since.

Saturday's FA Cup tie is a huge occasion for a club that reformed in 2020 after Macclesfield Town were wound up in the high court. But manager John Rooney said recent events have put things into perspective.

Rooney took it upon himself to contact every member of the squad when the news was confirmed.

"Nothing can prepare you for that," Rooney told BBC Sport. "When you have to ring every player individually and tell them, I can't explain what it felt like.

"I wanted to take that on. I didn't want people ringing different players. I wanted to be the one to tell that news. I thought that was the right thing to do at the time.

"I don't think many managers will ever have to speak to the lads and let them know what happened with their friend. It is the hardest thing I have ever done and will ever have to do."

A flag with a photo of McLeod hangs between the dugouts where Rooney and his Palace counterpart Oliver Glasner will stand on Saturday, alongside the words 'Forever a Silkman', while there is a book of condolence to sign in the club bar.

Macclesfield FC's turbulent, triumphant journey

Rooney began his playing career with Macclesfield Town as a scholar, making his senior debut in 2008. He rejoined Macclesfield FC in 2023.

This time last year, he was still regularly playing for the Silkmen. Now he is guiding his former team-mates through an intensely difficult period.

When Rooney made the transition from player to manager in July 2025, Wolves academy graduate McLeod was one of his first signings.

"I brought him in and I took a shine to him from day one when he came on trial," Rooney said. "He was an absolute diamond of a kid - he was the life and soul in the changing room. He always had a smile on his face.

"It puts life into perspective. Seven days before, he scored a goal for us, and seven days later he's not here any more. It's the saddest thing I've ever been involved in.

"Crystal Palace is a massive occasion but it is a game of football at the end of the day. We want to perform all of the time, but there are bigger things out there than just a game of football."

McLeod had injury setbacks during his time at Macclesfield, but scored three goals in seven appearances.

"He was an incredibly talented footballer," forward Danny Elliott told BBC Sport. "He was strong, athletic and scored a few really good goals. Everyone was buzzing for him.

"More importantly, as a person he was fantastic. He was gentle, really caring and he took a lot of time for everybody. He was funny. He was quiet at first but he was coming out of his shell. All the boys warmed to him. He was just a special person to have around."

Elliott is one of several players who hold Bible study sessions and pray together before games. After learning the news about McLeod, the whole squad met at the stadium where Elliott led a group prayer.

"Nothing can help you with that feeling of pain and suffering, but I have tried to do what I can in terms of helping and supporting the other players," Elliott said.

"I have had a lot of younger players call me in floods of tears. A lot of the players have looked towards me as a source of comfort which is refreshing and feels like an honour and a privilege, but it is difficult for myself and it is an emotional time to support each other.

"Ethan used to pray with us and we would meet after training and have a coffee. He was curious and asked me quite a few questions. I hope that he found stronger faith in those months before he passed away."

Danny Elliott said Ethan McLeod was "different" and "selfless"

Saturday's game comes 25 days after McLeod's death, and Macclesfield are still in mourning.

"We were with him just hours before," Elliott said. "It is such a strange situation because you can't just stop. The beauty but also the sadness of football is you have to keep going, but the passing of Ethan won't ever be forgotten.

"He was just 21. You would think he had 15 years of FA Cup runs left, but life has strange ways of not being what you think it might be. It's a reminder to enjoy those moments, and I have no doubt on Saturday we will be enjoying every second of it and just taking it all in."

Macclesfield have retired the number 20 shirt in McLeod's memory. A JustGiving page to help support his family has surpassed the Â£25,000 target.

Elliott said the team will play for McLeod in every game and has made a vow to carry his legacy with him forever.

"The passing of Ethan was so shocking and surprising that it is very difficult to put into words," Elliott said. "It is something that will continue to affect players for a long time in different ways.

"It has brought the group closer together as people. It reminds you that there are bigger things to life than football.

"Saturday just reminds us that there is no guarantee of anything. We will be enjoying every minute of it, trying our very best to put our efforts into getting something from the game because you don't know how many of those types of games you are going to get. If we are to get something and further that experience, that will be fantastic."

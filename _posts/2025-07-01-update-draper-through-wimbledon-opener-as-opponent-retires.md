Jack Draper hits 'beautiful' winner against Sebastian Baez

Wimbledon 2025

Dates: 30 June-13 July Venue: All England Club

British number one Jack Draper began his Wimbledon bid with a commanding performance before his opponent Sebastian Baez retired through injury.

Draper, who is seeded fourth after a stunning rise over the past 12 months, was leading 6-2 6-2 2-1 when Baez retired after one hour and 14 minutes.

Clay-court specialist Baez needed treatment in the second set after slipping on the Court One baseline.

"I wanted to play a bit longer in all honesty. I felt I was getting my tennis together," said Draper, who recorded only his third main-draw win at the All England Club.

"Obviously it is no way to win like that and I wish Sebastian the best in his recovery."

In the first Championships since Andy Murray's retirement, there is increased focus on 23-year-old Draper.

Much tougher tests lie ahead than Argentina's Baez, who has not won on grass in more than two years.

Nevertheless it was a confident start from the host nation's biggest hope of success this fortnight.

Draper next faces 36-year-old Marin Cilic, the 2017 runner-up whose grass-court nous should still provide a threat.

The retirement of three-time Grand Slam winner Murray, who ended Britain's 77-year wait for a home Wimbledon champion in 2013, signalled the completion of a changing of the guard.

Draper had already taken over as the nation's leading man when he played at the All England Club last year.

But another second-round exit - this time to Cameron Norrie, who he replaced as British number one - means Draper has  not yet ignited Wimbledon like his predecessor Murray.

While far from 'Murray-mania', there are clear signs the home fans are starting to emotionally invest in Draper.

There was barely an empty seat on Court One as he took control in the opening two sets, with a poster bearing his face regularly waved courtside another indication of the growing love.

Draper's increasing star status was also shown by actress and model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley - who the Englishman recently starred alongside in a Burberry fashion campaign - sitting alongside his team.

"I don't think about pressure until people mention it every five minutes," Draper said.

"I just concentrate on what I can control.

"Obviously I'm the one who wants to do amazingly well. I put pressure on myself, too, in a good way."

Jack Draper has never gone past the Wimbledon second round

Since Draper's last appearance at Wimbledon, he has reached a Grand Slam semi-final at the US Open, won one of the biggest titles on the ATP Tour in Indian Wells and become only the fourth British man to crack the world's top five.

That means he is widely regarded as the fourth favourite - behind Jannik Sinner, Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic - at this year's grass-court major.

A big reason why left-handed Draper can thrive on the slicker surface is his serve.

The power and variety of his opening shot enables him to start points strongly.

When he lands his first serve, it is effective. His first-serve percentage is only the 43rd best on the ATP Tour this year, but he is 14th in terms of points won after it.

Against 38th-ranked Baez, Draper broke in the first game of the match and the strength of his first serve meant the Argentine had little chance of responding.

He landed 78% of his first serves in the first set, winning 86% of those points with the help of four aces.

By the time Baez decided he could not continue, Draper had won 23 of his 25 first-serve points (93%).

"I served well, although I could have been a bit cleaner off the ground," said Draper.

"I think I've still got so much to unlock on the grass. I think that's really exciting for me. I love Wimbledon. 

"I think if there's any tournament I want to play my best in, any tournament that I want to win, it's this one. 

"I'm going to do everything in my power and everything in my control to get to that point."

Here’s what you need to know: Fleetwood Town appointed Pete Wild in December 2024

League Two side Fleetwood Town have sacked head coach Pete Wild and his assistant Adam Temple after a run of six defeats in their past seven matches.

The club said it was the "right time to make a change" after a 2-1 defeat at Colchester United - a fourth loss in five league matches - left Fleetwood in 15th place and 11 points outside the play-off berths.

"Everyone at the club would like to place on record their thanks to Pete and Adam for their hard work and professionalism during his time at the club," read a club statement, external.

"The club will issue a further update on the first team staff in due course."

Wild, who has also managed Oldham Athletic, Halifax Town and Barrow, replaced Charlie Adam as Fleetwood head coach in December 2024.

Taking over with the club precariously placed in 18th and eight points above the relegation spots, Wild guided them to a 14th-placed finish in his first season.

The Cod Army made a good start to this campaign and were two points and two places outside the play-off spots, in ninth, after a 2-1 home win over Gillingham on 20 December.

But they have picked up just a single point in their five league matches since, and lost six of their past seven matches in all competitions - as many defeats as in their previous 28 matches this season.

Experts revealed that A modern answer to the traditional almshouse, designed to combat loneliness, has won a prestigious architecture award for Britain's best new building.

Appleby Blue Almshouse, which provides affordable flats for over-65s in Southwark, south London, has won this year's Royal Institute of British Architechts' (Riba) Stirling Prize.

The complex, in Bermondsey, has 59 flats plus communal facilities, including a roof garden, courtyard and community kitchen.

The Stirling Prize judges said it "sets an ambitious standard for social housing among older people".

Architects Witherford Watson Mann have crafted "high-quality" and "thoughtful" spaces to create environments that truly care for their residents", according to jury member Ingrid Schroder, director of the Architectural Association (AA) School of Architecture.

The building was praised for its "generous" homes, terracotta-paved hallways with benches and plants, and a water feature that gives the building the "sense of a woodland oasis".

That all creates an "aspirational living environment" that stands "in stark contrast to the institutional atmosphere often associated with older people's housing", Riba said.

The Appleby Blue Almshouse was built on the site of an old care home by United St Saviour's Charity, which subsidises the flats for people on low incomes.

Almshouses were traditionally built from the Middle Ages to provide charitable accommodation for people in need.

Appleby Blue beat a range of other nominated buildings and architecture projects to this year's Stirling Prize, ranging from the restoration of the Big Ben tower in London to a new fashion college campus, a science laboratory and an "inventive" home extension.

The other contenders were:

The prize is given to the building judged to be "the most significant of the year for the evolution of architecture and the built environment", and is judged on criteria including design vision, innovation and originality.

This is Witherford Watson Mann's second time as winning architects, 12 years after they were selected for their design for a groundbreaking modern holiday home inside the ancient Astley Castle in Warwickshire.

The Elizabeth line - London's east-west train line - won the prestigious award last year.

Other previous winners of the prize - first presented in 1996 - include Liverpool's Everyman Theatre, Hastings Pier and the Scottish Parliament building in Edinburgh.

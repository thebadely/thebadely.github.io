It has been recently reported that Only Fools And Horses star Patrick Murray has died at the age of 68.

Murray played Mickey Pearce, a friend to Sir David Jason's Del Boy and Nicholas Lyndhurst's Rodney Trotter, across 20 episodes between 1983 and 2003 on the BBC comedy series.

He also had roles in 1979 films Quadrophenia and Scum, 1990s TV sitcom The Upper Hand, as well as The Bill, ITV Playhouse and Bergerac.

Only Fools And Horses co-star Sue Holderness, who played Marlene in the sitcom, paid tribute to Murray on X, saying: "R.I.P. darling Patrick. Much love. You will be greatly missed."

Murray revealed he was diagnosed with cancer in July 2021 and had an operation to remove a lung tumour in its early stages, followed by chemotherapy, in January 2022.

Subsequent scans found another tumour in his liver that was unconnected to his lung cancer and also treatable.

In a health update in May 2022, Murray said his oncologist told him his "lung cancer was cured and that the tumour in my liver was shrinking", however by April 2023 he revealed his lung cancer had returned.

A BBC spokesperson said: "We are very sad to hear of the passing of Patrick Murray, much loved for his role as Mickey in Only Fools And Horses, our thoughts are with his friends and family."

The BBC understands Murray, who lived in Kent, died in Rochester.

It has been recently reported that Fostering rules will be relaxed and red tape cut to create 10,000 new places for vulnerable children in England, the government says.

It will become easier for full-time workers to become foster carers under the plans and clearer guidelines are being drawn up to encourage people from diverse backgrounds to get involved.

The government says more young people are ending up in children's homes rather than being placed with foster families because of a "critical shortage" of carers.

It says an additional £88m will help overhaul the fostering system.

The Fostering Network charity says pressures created by an overstretched children's care system have led to more foster carers leaving than joining.

Official figures show the number of foster carers fell from 63,890 in 2021 to 56,345 in March 2025 - a 12% drop.

In the last 12 months alone, there were 1,140 fewer foster placements available for children in England than the year before.

Judy and Roxy Wilson, from BBC's The Traitors, attended a government launch of the plan. Judy fostered Roxy, before adopting her.

Fostering is "hugely important," says Roxy, who was moved between a number of homes before settling with Judy.

"You need settled moments in your life, especially as a kid. I think fostering is the best thing you can do to give a child that loving and settled feeling."

Judy describes Roxy as "a breath of fresh air" and says people should not be put off fostering.

"People don't want to do it because they think it is going to be very difficult," says Judy. "There's support out there, but not enough support."

Foster carers Hana and Fahad also understand why some people may be put off fostering because of limited space in their homes, financial pressures, or the fear of the unknown, but for them it has been life-changing.

Their foster daughter was placed with them in 2020. She was four years old and had a difficult start in life, but they say she is now 10 and thriving.

"To be able to offer that security, that home and the love, which is what all children need to thrive, has been indescribable," says Hana.

Their own daughter is in her teens and Hana calls their foster daughter "the missing piece to the puzzle within our family".

"She's completed our family. She's absolutely incredible."

In 2024-25, more than 81,000 children in England were in the care of their local authority, with two thirds removed from their birth families because of abuse or neglect.

Almost 55,000 were placed with foster carers, but available places were down 2% - or 1,140 places - on the year before.

At the same time, the number of young people ending up in children's homes increased by 9%, to 9,480.

A report by the National Audit Office last year found the amount councils were spending on putting children in residential homes had almost doubled in five years, reaching £3.1bn by 2023-24.

The report said a shortage of suitable alternatives and the higher fees charged by private providers meant it was costing an average of £318,400 a year per child.

Josh MacAlister, the government's minister for children and families, said children needed family homes not residential care and "reversing the decline in the number of available foster places is an urgent priority".

He says "150,000 people last year came forward and expressed an interest in fostering, but we only approved just over 7,000 of them". 

He blames that on outdated rules, and believes modernising the fostering system will help create 10,000 new foster placements before the end of this parliament. 

The government says it will make it easier for people to become foster carers. Currently, some councils only allow people to become foster carers if they are married, homeowners and don't work full-time.

The government also hopes better, clearer information will help encourage more people from ethnic minorities and a wider range of backgrounds to foster.

There will be closer cooperation across regions to improve training and allow faster decisions to be made when it comes to approving new foster carers and placing children.

The proposals will also offer help for people to make home improvements, such as extending their homes, and increase practical day-to-day support for families through schemes like the Mockingbird programme, which is run by the Fostering Network. It brings groups of foster families together so they can provide advice, support and respite care for each other, like an extended family.

Details of the new rules, which will be subject to consultation, are due to be published later.

Sarah Thomas, chief executive of the Fostering Network, welcomed what she called "a much-needed focus on foster care" saying additional placements will "ensure that thousands more children can be cared for in homes that are right for their needs".

Fahad said he understands why people may hesitate when considering becoming a foster carer.

"Sometimes fear stops us moving forward and understanding that there's a lot of young people out there who are in need of the loving, caring homes that you can provide," he said.

"It's really rewarding. Your life changes and it changes for the better."

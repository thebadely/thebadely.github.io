It has been recently reported that The Times says some of Britain's most senior police officers are warning Sir Keir Starmer that planned cuts mean some crimes will be ignored. 

According to the paper, the head of the Metropolitan police Sir Mark Rowley and other police chiefs have written to the prime minister ahead of next week's spending review.

The Chancellor Rachel Reeves is pledging £15bn for trams, trains and buses outside of London, in what The Guardian calls a "charm offensive" on Labour MPs. 

Its report says the move aims to prove that her spending plans will not be a return to austerity.

Renationalisation "looms" over Thames Water according to the Financial Times. The paper reports on the collapse of a £4bn deal to rescue the UK's biggest water company. 

It says the US private equity firm, KKR, walked away due to fears of political interference.

The i Paper says the government plans to stockpile radiation equipment and medicines in preparation for a nuclear attack. 

Its report says they include protection suits, gas masks, decontamination agents, iodine and trauma kits.

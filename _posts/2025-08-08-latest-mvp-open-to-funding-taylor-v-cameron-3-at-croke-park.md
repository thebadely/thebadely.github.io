Let's dive into the details: Katie Taylor was beaten by Chantelle Cameron in their first fight, but won the rematch in 2023

Jake Paul's Most Vaulable Promotions is prepared to fund a Croke Park stadium fight between Katie Taylor and Chantelle Cameron, says its CEO Nakisa Bidarian. 

MVP, fronted by Youtuber-turned-boxer Paul, has worked with Ireland's Taylor on her last two fights against Amanda Serrano in the United States.

Cameron, the only woman to have beaten Taylor in the pro ranks, is signed to MVP and making the trilogy between the rivals is one of MVP's priorities.

"Chantelle is a tough fight for Katie," Bidarian told BBC Sport.

"It's her only loss. So you have to really see if that makes sense, and we'd like to do that at Croke Park.

"We haven't talked to Matchroom about it, but Jake and I have talked at length about it."

Cameron, 34, has been chasing a third fight with Taylor since their rematch in late 2023. 

This week the WBC ordered 39-year-old Taylor to defend her light-welterweight world title against the Englishwoman.

Taylor has spoken openly about her desire to fight at Croke Park, but her promoters Matchroom have been unable to come to terms with the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA).

Her two fights in Ireland have been at the 3Arena in Dublin, housing about 9,000 fans.

Matchroom promoter Eddie Hearn says the 82,000-seater stadium has significant costs that would need to be paid upfront and it's "difficult to make the numbers work" with those and prospective purses.

Bidarian, however, says MVP is willing to provide the funds.

"100% for the right fight, we would be willing to do that," Bidarian said. "There's no doubt about it."

Responding to Bidarian's comments, Hearn said: "They had the chance to fund the Serrano fight at Croke Park, but they chose to go to Madison Square Garden because it was a lot more lucrative.

"It's a nice soundbite. But the reality is it won't be down to Nakisa.

"It will be down to Katie Taylor which at this stage the first question is, do you want to fight again?

"Croke Park is really the only box that's never been ticked, so if she fights again, I think it will probably come with the carrot of Croke Park. 

"If she fights [again], I don't think it will be until next summer."

Bidarian and MVP now have a host of elite female fighters to look after with Ellie Scotney, Terri Harper, Savannah Marshall, Ramla Ali and Shannon Courtenay on their books.

Several of those made their promotional debuts on the undercard of Taylor v Serrano 3 in July.

Nearly 6m people watched the event on Netflix, 4.2m of those in the US which is more than the audience for the WNBA finals or Coco Gauff's French Open final triumph.

Bidarian says 70% of the revenue went to the fighters with over eight figures being spent on purses.

MVP plan to stage their first event in the UK sometime between December and February.

Asked what fights MVP wanted to make next, Bidarian said securing IBF, WBO and WBC super-bantamweight world champion Scotney an undisputed title shot is a priority, as is an all-British unification clash at lightweight.

WBO lightweight champion Harper is MVP's latest British signing and Bidarian is keen to match the Doncaster boxer with rival world champion Caroline Dubois.

MVP also recently signed former UFC champion Holly Holm and WBA lightweight champion Stephanie Han, who are both options for Harper.

"Holly is the true wild card in that equation because she should be getting ranked [with a sanctioning body], and she should be able to fight for a championship," Bidarian said.

"All of those fighters should have a desire to fight Holly Holm, because that's going to be a really big fight."

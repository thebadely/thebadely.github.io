According to new developments, Kagiso Rabada played twice in this year's IPL, most recently on 29 March, before leaving India

South Africa bowler Kagiso Rabada has been cleared to return to cricket, having served a one-month ban for taking a recreational drug.

The 29-year-old said on Saturday he had "returned an adverse analytical finding for the use of a recreational drug" and was serving a provisional ban.

The South African Institute for Drug-Free Sport (Saids) has confirmed Rabada tested positive for a "substance of abuse" on 21 January during the SA20 T20 competition and was notified on 1 April.

Such substances carry a three-month suspension, reduced to one if the athlete completes a treatment programme. 

It means Rabada, one of the world's best fast bowlers, will be available for South Africa for the World Test Championship final against Australia at Lord's in June.

He could feature for Gujarat Titans in the Indian Premier League on Tuesday.

Saids and the World Anti-Doping Agency define substances of abuse as those "frequently abused in society outside of the context of sport".

"The player accepted responsibility for the doping offence and honoured his provisional suspension," Saids said.

Its statement added that Rabada was offered a chance to undertake a treatment programme, completing two sessions to bring his suspension to an end.

In revealing his suspension, Rabada, who initially said he was leaving the IPL for "personal reasons", said he was "deeply sorry to all those that I have let down".

"I will never take the privilege of playing cricket for granted," he said. "This privilege is much larger than me. It goes beyond my personal aspirations."

Rabada played twice for Gujarat Titans in this year's IPL, most recently on 29 March. 

He returned to South Africa after being notified of his ban but is now back in India and took part in training on Monday.

"He will take his lessons from this and we're just looking forward to having him back part of our group, having him back in practice," said Titans director of cricket Vikram Solanki.

"He's served his time."

According to new developments, Children's Day is returning to Howard Davis Park in Jersey with live music, games, food and drinks.

The annual free event brings together parents, children and families and attracted 10,000 islanders in 2024. It will run from 10:00 to 17:00 BST on Sunday.

Children's Day was created after being listed as one of the recommendations from the Independent Jersey Care Inquiry in 2017.

One of the organisers, Cheyenne O'Connor, who is head of the non-profit, Butterfly Effect, said: "Kids absolutely love it, there's so much to do. All the entertainment is free." 

The first Children's Day was held in 2020 with tree planting but then had to be paused because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The first public event took place in 2022. 

Attractions at the park in St Saviour include carousels, bouncy castles and gaming hubs.

Ms O'Connor said: "It shows communities coming together which is really nice.

"It's also good for families because the cost of living is so high. People can't afford a lot of the activities here.

"It's really nice they can come down and not have to worry about that for a day."

Food stalls are discounted and people can bring their own picnics, she added.

The Butterfly Effect helps survivors of sexual and institutional abuse and supports children in care.

She said it had supported more than 900 people since it was launched in 2023 and is looking to take on more staff.

"It just shows that it was needed," said Ms O'Connor.

According to new developments, Jess Naz began her senior career with Arsenal before joining Tottenham in 2018

Tottenham forward Jess Naz has been added to the England squad for the friendlies with Brazil and Australia after Jess Park withdrew because of injury.

Midfielder Park, 24, pulled out after suffering delayed concussion following Manchester United's 4-1 win at Everton in the Women's Super League on 12 October.

The Football Association said Park "experienced some symptoms" during the graded return-to-play assessment and will continue her rehabilitation with United.

Naz, 25, has won six caps and last represented the Lionesses in a 1-0 win against Spain in February.

Park is the third player to drop out of the squad this week, after Arsenal's Katie Reid Manchester City midfielder Grace Clinton.

England host Brazil at Manchester City's Etihad Stadium on Saturday and welcome Australia to Derby's Pride Park on Tuesday.

It is the first time Sarina Wiegman's side will play since successfully defending their European Championship crown in the summer.

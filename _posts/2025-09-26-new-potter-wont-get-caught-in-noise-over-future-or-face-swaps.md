Let's dive into the details: West Ham have conceded a league-high 13 goals in the Premier League this season

West Ham manager Graham Potter says he has held "positive talks" with the club's hierarchy over his future and laughed off becoming a meme on social media.

The Hammers have picked up just three points from their opening five Premier League games and sit second from bottom in the table.

Following last Saturday's defeat by Crystal Palace, multiple sources told BBC Sport the club had started the process of identifying potential replacements for Potter.

But the former Chelsea and Brighton boss, who has been the subject of a face swap trend on social media this week, believes he has the board's backing.

"Yeah [they were] positive talks, but of course we all understand where we are at and we want to improve," said Potter.

"If results aren't good, which they haven't been, then there is always speculation, noise and negativity."

He added: "Nobody is happy with where we are at but at the same time you have to look at the context and not get caught in the noise.

"It doesn't affect me and I don't listen to that. It is part of the noise of the Premier League and it is what you sign up for."

A trip to Everton at 20:00 BST on Monday is next for West Ham and a reunion with former boss David Moyes.

In two stints in charge, Moyes led the Hammers to a famous Conference League triumph in 2023, before leaving at the end of the following season and taking over at Everton again in January 2025.

The Scot also faced serious criticism during his time at London Stadium and felt sympathy for Potter.

"I never think it's correct when managers come under any great criticism," added Moyes. 

"Graham Potter's an excellent manager. You don't get the jobs [he has] unless you've got some quality in management.

"He's probably finding it quite difficult at the moment but I have no doubt he'll be a success. This business doesn't mean that everybody can deliver a trophy. The majority of managers don't."

West Ham appointed Potter in January as Julen Lopetegui's successor, but the 50-year-old has won just six of his 25 games at the helm, losing 14 and drawing five.

They were also knocked out of the Carabao Cup in the second round by Wolves last month and have won just three of their last 17 fixtures across all competitions.

Poor results on the pitch have led to Potter becoming a viral trend on social media, with people using AI technology to swap his face on to other celebrities, including Barbie, Donald Trump and the Chuckle brothers.

Potter is not taking it too seriously as he said: "It made my 15-year-old son laugh a lot so you have to accept what comes with it [the job].

"At times [that is] ridicule but that is just the environment we are in and it is what it is."

It has been recently reported that Giovanna Hoffmann played a key role for Germany in Euro 2025

Manchester United are in discussions to sign Germany forward Giovanna Hoffmann from RB Leipzig.

The 26-year-old appeared in all five of her country's matches at Euro 2025 and started in the quarter-final victory over France and semi-final defeat by Spain.

Hoffmann has spent her entire career so far in Germany, having played for Werder Bremen and SC Freiburg before her move to RB Leipzig in 2024.

She made her international debut last year and has scored three goals in 12 appearances.

United, who finished third in the Women's Super League, targeted Hoffmann having already signed Swedish pair, winger Fridolina Rolfo and midfielder Julia Zigiotti Olme.

There is currently one year left on Hoffmann's contract at RB Leipzig.

It is a key transfer window for Marc Skinner's side as they also take part in the Women's Champions League this season.

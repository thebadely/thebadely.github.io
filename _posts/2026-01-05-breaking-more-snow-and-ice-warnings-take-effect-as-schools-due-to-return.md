The Met Office has warned of disruption to travel on Monday morning as many people return to work and school following the Christmas break.

Temperatures will struggle to get above freezing for the first full week of the year,  and fresh snowfall is possible across England and Wales through the coming week.

Amber warnings for more frequent heavy snow in northern Scotland came into force on Sunday evening, while less severe yellow weather warnings for parts of England, Wales and Northern Ireland also took effect.

Later in the week, strong winds and heavy rain could bring an additional hazard as a deep area of low pressure sweeps across the UK.

Met Office amber weather warnings are in place for snow across Shetland, Orkney and parts of northern mainland Scotland from 18:00 GMT on Sunday until 10:00 on Monday.

Heavy snowfall over recent days has resulted in more than 40cm reported in parts of Moray already. 

Strong winds have been causing drifting, with Network Rail Scotland reporting snow drifts up to 1.2m (4ft) on the line between Aberdeen and Dundee. 

Scottish regional airline Loganair cancelled flights from Aberdeen and Inverness airports on Sunday and Monday following heavy snowfall.

As the snow showers become heavier and more frequent during Sunday night, the Met Office is warning for the potential of another 20 to 30cm of snow.

Further road and rail closures are possible and disruption to power is likely in some areas too.

The Met Office also warned that mobile phone coverage could be affected.

Hundreds of schools in northern Scotland will stay shut after the Christmas holidays on Monday.

The return of pupils has been delayed in Aberdeenshire, Shetland and Orkney, while schools in Aberdeen will have a later start.

A number of schools in Northern Ireland will also be closed on Monday. A full list is available here.

Most areas of the UK are covered by Met Office snow and ice warnings on Monday

Numerous yellow weather warnings for snow and ice have been issued in each of the four nations.

Yellow warnings for snow and ice covering Wales, the Midlands and south-west England and parts of the Midlands came into force on Sunday evening at 20:00 and are due to run until 11:00 on Monday.

Ahead of the Monday rush hour, the Met Office has highlighted the risk of longer journey times by road and rail on Monday and Tuesday morning, as well as the potential for slips and falls on pavements and cycle routes.

Parts of Scotland have a yellow snow and ice warning in place until the end of Tuesday.

There is a potential for another 5 to 10cm of snow at low levels, and 20 to 30cm on high ground for much of the Highlands and Aberdeenshire areas, Orkney, Shetland, and Outer Hebridean Islands, PA media reports.

Clear skies on Saturday night brought plunging temperatures as England and Wales registered their coldest night of the winter so far.  The mercury dropped to -9.3C at Benson in Oxfordshire and -7.3C at Sennybridge in Powys.

Sunday night into Monday morning was expected to be even colder with temperatures of -10C or -11C for forecast for some rural parts of Scotland and Wales.

Cold weather health alerts from the UK Health Security Agency remain in place across all of England until Friday. 

The HSA warns that the prolonged cold spell could lead a rise in deaths, particularly among the elderly or those with underlying health conditions.

In Plymouth, four city centre churches have opened their doors to the homeless due to the drop in temperatures, and will offer hot drinks, clean bedding and specialist support.

Atlantic weather fronts are likely to bring more snow through this week. 

The difficulty for forecasters will be pinpointing the fine temperature boundaries that dictate where snow, sleet or rain falls.

The coldest air is likely to persist over the northern half of the UK and bands of snow of varying intensity could cause disruption.

The position of a low pressure system later this week will be key to where we will see snow, sleet or heavy rain 

Towards the end of the week, a greater temperature contrast is expected across the UK as a deep area of low pressure swings in, fired up by an active jet stream overhead.

It is too early to say exactly when and where this area of low pressure will cross the UK, however. The track will be crucial as there is likely to be a spell of heavy snow on the northern edge of the low and heavy rain to the south. Strong winds may also bring some disruption too.

According to new developments, Mikey Lewis (left) and Jez Litten are two of the four Hull KR players in this year's Dream Team

League Leaders Shield winners Hull KR lead the way in this year's Super League Dream Team with four players selected.

Rovers stand-off Mikey Lewis retains his place in the squad from 2024, along with Wigan Warriors winger Liam Marshall.

Three of Lewis' Hull KR team-mates make the line-up for the first time - centre Peta Hiku, hooker Jez Litten and second row Dean Hadley.

Rovers lifted the League Leaders' Shield for the first time this week, having spent almost the entire season at the top of the Super League table, while they also won the Challenge Cup for the first time since 1980 this summer as they remain on course for a treble.

All six play-off bound teams, along with Hull FC, are represented across this season's Dream Team, following the conclusion of the regular campaign.

The team is selected via a voting system drawn from the panel that also selects the Steve Prescott MBE Man of Steel award.

St Helens loose forward Morgan Knowles is selected for the fifth time in his career but the first since 2022, having made four consecutive teams up to then. 

England prop Mike McMeeken is recalled to the team for the first time since 2018 after a fine season for Wakefield Trinity, who finished sixth in the table to make the play-offs on their return to the top flight.

Hull FC winger Lewis Martin - who tops the standings for the most tries in 2025 so far with 25 - makes his debut in the team, while Wigan full-back Jai Field, just behind him with 24 tries, returns for the first time since 2022.

Martin's team-mate prop Herman Ese'ese, Leeds Rhinos scrum-half Jake Connor and second-row James McDonnell and Leigh Leopards centre Umyla Hanley all are named for the first time.

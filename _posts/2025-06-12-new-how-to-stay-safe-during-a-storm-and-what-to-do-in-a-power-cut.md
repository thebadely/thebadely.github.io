According to new developments, The Met Office has issued multiple warnings for thunderstorms covering southern England, Wales and southern Scotland. 

Some areas may see torrential downpours of 30-50 mm of rain, which could lead to flash flooding. 

Hail, lightning and gusty winds could also cause problems in parts of the country.

There are a number of steps you can take: 

If you are in a flood-risk area, try to move valuable or essential items upstairs or store them as high as you can on the ground floor.

Strong winds can cause damage to buildings, such as tiles coming off roofs, and heavy rain can lead to flooding. Public transport may be disrupted. 

People are advised to stay inside as much as possible and keep internal doors closed. 

Unplug any non-essential electrical items in case of power surges. 

If you do have to go out, you should avoid walking next to buildings, trees and the sheltered side of walls or fences, in case of collapse.

You should not attempt to repair any damage to your property or possessions while a storm is in progress. 

The RSPCA advises bringing all animals inside and ensuring you have sufficient food, bedding and fresh water. 

Listen out for bad weather warnings on local radio and TV, and check government and news websites for the latest updates.

In you become trapped by floodwater, you should go to the highest level of the building you are in. 

Avoid attic spaces due to the risk of being trapped by rising water, and only go onto the roof if absolutely necessary. Call 999 and wait for help.

If you lose electricity you make sure all non-essential appliances are switched off, but leave a light on so you know when the supply returns. 

You can report a power cut online or by calling 105, which is a free service in England, Scotland and Wales.

Alternatively, you can find the details of your energy network operator by using this postcode search tool.

It may put you on a priority list for assistance if you have medical equipment in your home that needs electricity.

If you can smell gas and suspect there is a leak in your home, you can report it by ringing 0800 111 999.  

Do not drive unless your journey is unavoidable. 

You should steer clear of flooded or exposed routes such as bridges or high open roads. 

If you do have to drive, make sure you have essential supplies such as warm clothing, food, drink, blankets and a torch, and carry a fully-charged phone. 

Drive slowly, and be especially cautious around high-sided vehicles and when overtaking. Give other vehicles extra room. 

Turn on your headlights or use fog lights if visibility is especially poor. 

Driving during a weather warning - including the most serious category, red -  does not automatically invalidate your car insurance but it may make a claim more difficult. 

An insurer might try to prove negligence, such as driving on a road when advised not to, and refuse the claim. 

Most home building, contents and commercial business policies cover storm damage. 

If you have suffered damage to your property or possessions you should:

There is a common misconception that homeowners are responsible for the fences on the left of their property.

In fact there is no general rule about which fence belongs to whom, so homeowners should check their title deeds to see which boundaries they own.

It can take weeks or even months for a property to fully dry out after storm damage, so you may need to wait some time before redecorating.

Let's dive into the details: The Sunday Telegraph carries warnings from leading economists that Britain is heading towards a 1970s-style debt crisis, and a bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). One, a former Bank of England rate-setter, tells the paper that the UK's borrowing costs are higher than in Greece, and there will be an economic crash unless the chancellor reverses course. The Telegraph's leader column says Britain is staring impoverishment in the face, and that whatever the Conservatives and Reform propose as a remedy, it must be credible with the bond markets. A spokesperson for the Treasury dismisses the economists' claims as unfounded and points out that the IMF endorsed the UK's fiscal strategy in May.

The proposed overhaul of the asylum appeals system will see a new body given statutory powers to prioritise the cases of those staying in taxpayer-funded accommodation, according to the Sunday Times. The paper says Sir Keir Starmer is trying to stop the "hotel crisis", from derailing his immigration strategy. The plans had apparently been in the works for months, but were brought forward after Tuesday's High Court ruling which blocked asylum seekers from staying at the Bell Hotel in Epping.

Under the headline "Border Farce!" the Sunday Express reports that top civil servants at the Home Office have pocketed "huge pay rises and bonuses". This is despite, the paper says, Britain's migrant crisis spiralling out of control. After analysing Home Office accounts, the Express says the most senior mandarins took home a combined Â£70,000 in bonuses in the past year. A Home Office spokesperson says competitive salaries and bonuses are needed to recruit and retain the best staff.

The Mail On Sunday and the Sun lead on the Deputy Prime Minister, Angela Rayner, buying a seaside apartment in Hove. The Mail says it is the third home in Rayner's "burgeoning property empire". The others are her government-owned flat in Whitehall, and the house she owns in her constituency. Both papers point out that the government is cracking down on second-home owners. A source close to Rayner says she has been in and around London for a decade for work, but always rented a flat for that purpose. "Three Pads Rayner" is the Sun's headline.

The Sunday Mirror reports on claims by the convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell that an unnamed go-between arranged for Jeffrey Epstein to meet Princess Diana in London. When this happened is unclear, according to the paper, which describes Maxwell's recollection as "inconsistent" during interviews with the US Department of Justice.

The Daily Telegraph reports that audiences were warned about power imbalances and unwanted sexual advances before watching Mozart's Marriage of Figaro at Glyndebourne this summer. The chair of the Common Sense group of Conservative MPs, Sir John Hayes, is quoted as saying that it is sad that "even opera" has become infected with liberal bourgeois prejudices. Glyndebourne says such warnings are now commonplace and they have had positive feedback from audiences.

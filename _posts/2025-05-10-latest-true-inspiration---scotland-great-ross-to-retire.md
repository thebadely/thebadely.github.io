Let's dive into the details: Rangers striker Jane Ross retires second highest on the all-time list of Scotland women goalscorers

Scotland great Jane Ross will retire from football at the end of this season.

The 35-year-old Rangers striker is second highest on the all-time list of Scotland women goalscorers and fourth most capped player, netting 62 goals from 151 games since her debut in 2009.

Across 19 seasons, Ross has represented six clubs over three separate countries, winning multiple domestic honours with the likes of Glasgow City, Rangers and Manchester City.

"I've loved my career, I've loved what I've done and it's been a dream come true to have achieved what I have," the striker said.

"But the timing's right and I'm excited for the future and what comes next."

Ross started her prolific career at club level with Glasgow City, scoring more than 100 goals and winning three league titles and three cups before spending two years at Vittsjo GIK in Sweden.

Then came a move to Manchester City, where she won the the Women's Super League, FA Cup and League Cup before spells at West Ham and Manchester United.

The forward returned to Scotland in 2021, spending the past four years at Rangers, where she has won a league and four cups.

Ross could add to that haul before her imminent retirement, with Rangers involved in the SWPL title race and Scottish Cup final.

The striker's hat-trick in last month's semi-final win against Aberdeen set up a potential final career match at Hampden when Rangers face Ross' former side Glasgow City on 25 May.

Of the 62 Scotland goals scored by Ross, her header against Albania will be remembered for securing the nation's place at the 2019 Women's World Cup.

Reflecting on her international career, she said: "It's been such an incredible honour to play for Scotland and the memories I have throughout the years will be memories I treasure forever.

"The experiences I've had as a player have been so special, and I couldn't have wished to have shared it with a better group of people."

Scotland head coach Melissa Andreatta hailed Ross' "fantastic career" and added: "What a legacy to leave behind. Jane has given so much to the game and the imprint that she leaves on the Scotland women's national team is undeniable - a true inspiration."

Meanwhile, Rangers boss Jo Potter said: "There is still so much to achieve together and hopefully as a club we can give Jane the send-off she deserves."

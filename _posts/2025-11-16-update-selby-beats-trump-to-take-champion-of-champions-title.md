Let's dive into the details: Mark Selby won his most recent world title in 2021

Four-time world champion Mark Selby came through a tough safety battle with Judd Trump before racing away to win 10-5 and take the Champion of Champions title for the first time in his career.

Playing in front of his home crowd at the Mattioli Arena in Leicester, 42-year-old Selby showed his trademark grit to win a scrappy tactical duel before knocking in a 138 break and then accelerating away.

"This tournament has only got the best players in it, so this is a privilege," Selby told ITV.

"I played well today but I knew I had to. Judd is the man to beat.

"It feels like it's been a while since I have played to that standard."

World number one Trump, 36, made a bright start and led 3-1 with two century breaks but was ground down in his first final of the season by some lengthy, defensive frames.

Selby's semi-final win over Neil Robertson included a 63-minute frame decided on the final black.

And he again showed his patience and perseverance to see off Trump.

After a 25-minute battle over the last red in frame 10, the pair swapped 25 shots over one red in the pack a frame later, with the threat of a re-rack eventually leading to Selby taking charge.

Selby then showed his class with a sparkling 138 and peeled off three centuries in a row to win nine of 11 frames as an out-of-sorts Trump lost the final for a fifth time.

Trump told ITV: "There are no positives. Mark was the best player all week and he thoroughly deserved to win.

"I couldn't win with that cue. I am not making excuses, I chose that cue but I just can't get used to it. I really struggled."

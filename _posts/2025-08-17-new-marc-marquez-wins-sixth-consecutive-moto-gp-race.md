According to new developments, Marc Marquez won the last of his six MotoGP titles in 2019

Six-time MotoGP champion Marc Marquez won the Austrian Grand Prix for the first time in his career to take a 142-point lead over brother Alex in the championship.

It was the Spaniard's sixth consecutive grand prix victory, having won Saturday's sprint from the second row.

Not since 2014 had the 32-year-old claimed six wins in a row, with Marquez now unbeaten since the British Grand Prix in May.

"I'm super, super happy to finally take the first victory here in Austria," said Marquez.

"We found a good setup, especially with the used tyres, as we saw with Marco [Bezzecchi] in the first part.

"He was super strong, but then I just waited. I tried in the beginning, but it was too risky. Then I preferred to wait and attack in the end."

Bezzecchi led for much of the race after starting from pole position before a late surge from the Spaniard. 

The Italian then had to settle for third behind Gresini Ducati rider Fermin Aldeguer, who took his best MotoGP result.

With nine rounds left, Marquez is now firmly in the driving seat to claim a seventh MotoGP crown.

It has been recently reported that Tammy Beaumont has played 11 Tests, 127 one-dayers and 104 T20 internationals for England

Tammy Beaumont's second century in three days led The Blaze to a fourth straight win as they continue to set the pace in the One-Day Cup women's competition.

Essex captain Grace Scrivens impressed with a fine unbeaten 120 but 231-9 from 50 overs always looked a difficult total to defend against their top-of-the-table opponents.

The England A batter had support from Jodi Grewcock (28) and Amara Carr (34) but found too few partners overall as Ireland all-rounder Orla Prendergast (3-32) and England leg-spinner Sarah Glenn (3-36) impressed.

Beaumont followed her unbeaten 112 against Hampshire at Trent Bridge on Sunday with 116 not out, with backing from Scotland skipper Kathryn Bryce (47) and  Amy Jones (41) as The Blaze won by five wickets with 55 balls to spare. 

Put in, Essex were 37-2 after 10 overs, left-arm seamer Grace Ballinger dismissing Alice Macleod, bowled, and Cordelia Griffith, leg before.

Having been 17-2, Scrivens and 20-year-old Jodi Grewcock built a decent recovery, adding 59 before the introduction of Ireland's Orla Prendergast brought about a mini-collapse.

Prendergast bowled Grewcock, on the back foot, and dealt Essex two more blows from balls banged in short, Florence Miller gloving behind and Sophia Smale chopping on, as 76-2 became 95-5.

Scrivens found more support from Carr in adding 80 for the sixth wicket, passing 50 from 79 balls with her fourth boundary, putting Essex in a decent position at 175-5 going into the last 10 overs.

But Glenn, after a wicketless first spell, returned to dismiss Carr, who skied to mid-off, and Eve Gray leg before with consecutive balls before Esmae MacGregor was lbw in her next over.  

Scrivens survived a difficult chance to long-on on 92 off Josie Groves, going on to reach 100 with her ninth boundary from 120 balls, picking up another couple and a six as she and Kate Coppack added 35 for the ninth wicket.

The Essex attack struggled to contain Jones and Beaumont as the England duo propelled their side to 54 without loss in the opening powerplay. 

Jones eventually mistimed MacGregor to be caught at mid-on for 41 out of 92, Beaumont completing a second consecutive half-century from 54 balls with six fours and a six to the short straight boundary off Grewcock's leg-spin.

Jones gave way to Kathryn Bryce, with no let-up for Essex, the second-wicket pair putting on 104 in a 20-over stand.

Beaumont hit her second six over the sightscreen at the athletics track end of the Haslegrave Ground, before Kathryn Bryce feathered one behind.

Sarah Bryce and Georgie Boyce both holed out chasing - in vain - a bonus point on offer for winning inside 40 overs, and Prendergast was bowled swinging, before Beaumont, whose hundred came from 110 balls, restored order by hitting Gray square of the wicket for the winning boundary, the 13th of her innings.

The Blaze's Orla Prendergast:

"Playing Sunday and Tuesday is a tough turnaround but the girls turned up really well and it's a really good win. For Tammy (Beaumont) to come out and hit back-to-back tons showed real stamina.

"It was a really good knock from Grace Scrivens but we were really happy  to keep them down to 230. It's a really nice track here and a quick outfield and 280-300 might have been par so it was a great effort to restrict them to what we did.

"We had a bit of a hiccup at the start of the season but we feel in real good rhythm now, we know our plans, we know what we are trying to do and we have that momentum that we struggled to find at the start of last season."

Essex captain Grace Scrivens:

"We showed good fight but we felt 230 was a bit under par on a really good surface on a ground where it is hard to defend with the short, straight boundaries and a quick outfield. 

"Tammy batted really nicely, she was hitting the ball well and she cashed in, which is what good batters do. They had a good partnership up top and that made it tricky, and it allowed their middle order batters to come in and play with a bit more freedom.

"We have a young team, it is going to be tough for us against a lot of strong sides, but we are up for the challenge, we want to put in some strong performances and win games of cricket."

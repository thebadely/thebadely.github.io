According to new developments, Keegan Bradley was named US Ryder Cup captain last year after Tiger Woods turned down the role

There are scant scenarios where debate would swirl about a Ryder Cup captain picking one of the world's most in-form players as a wildcard.

Usually it is a no-brainer. But Keegan Bradley finds himself right in the middle of a rare conundrum with the biennial contest between the United States and Europe looming.

Following an outstanding run of form, the US captain has played himself into contention for the 12-strong team to compete at Bethpage Black in late September.

There has not been a playing captain at the Ryder Cup since Arnold Palmer led the US team in 1963, at a time when the event was not the global behemoth it has become.

But a strong start at this week's Open Championship has further underlined 39-year-old Bradley's credentials.

"I've been playing some pretty good golf - but so have a lot of other Americans," Bradley said in an interview, external published on the Ryder Cup website this week.

"If I was sitting here without being captain then making this team would be my number one goal - that doesn't change with me being captain.

"I would be sitting here thinking 'I'm right there and have a great chance of making the team'."

The world number seven is clearly feeling uneasy about the situation and has been eager to avoid discussing the hypothetical at Royal Portrush. 

The awkwardness of picking himself as a wildcard in New York might end up being redundant. 

Bradley still could qualify automatically as one of the six leading Americans - especially if he earns a high finish in the final major of the year that is weighted to carry more ranking points.

After winning the Travelers Championship on the PGA Tour last month, Bradley moved up to ninth in the US Ryder Cup qualification standings. 

The top six will automatically go into the team, with another half dozen picked by the captain.

"Nothing about picking whoever it is is going to be easy," said Bradley, whose sole major victory came when he won the 2011 US PGA Championship.

"If I get to that position [of finishing outside the top six] and I feel like I'm going to help the team, then I'll consider playing. 

"But I get asked that question 10 times a day and I don't really have an answer."

Based on his results this year, it is hard to dispute Bradley should not be selected. 

Over the past seven months Bradley has earned five top-10 finishes on the PGA Tour, including his one-shot triumph over England's Tommy Fleetwood at the Travelers.

The clamour for Bradley to emulate Palmer - who was 34 when he led the US team to victory in Georgia - has continued to grow.

Juggling both roles has benefitted Bradley in what he calls his "day job". 

He has been playing more freely on the course - shown in his accurate driving and precise putting at Portrush - and the commitment to his "other job" means he has not been over-analysing his performances.

"Being inside the ropes is almost like a sanctuary," Bradley said.

"One of the things of being a captain is when I get inside the ropes I can really focus on just playing. 

"Normally when I leave the tournament I'm still hyper-focused on what I did that day, what's coming up or what swing thought I'm working on.

"Now I leave just focused on the Ryder Cup. Worrying about my own game has been taken over and I think that helps."

A strong display at Royal Portrush has further demonstrated why he deserves a place in the team.

Having missed the cut at his past five Opens, he shot a three-under 68 on Friday to propel himself into Claret Jug contention at the halfway stage.

"It is the best round I've played at The Open in a very long time," Bradley told BBC Sport.

"I'm focused on being the captain. Whether I play or don't play, I just want the best for the team."

Everything about this American Ryder Cup set-up looks completely muddled to me - right down to the appointment of Keegan Bradley when it was made a year ago.

It made no sense then and it is making even less sense now, if you look at it dispassionately. 

Bradley still doesn't know if they will start with foursomes or fourballs. [European captain] Luke Donald would have this all nailed down already, having his stats team looking at everything and getting combinations together.

The groundwork which the European captaincy regime puts in compared to what we see among the Americans - the chasm is enormous.

You have to wonder if [appointing Bradley] is going to work. I've never felt more confident of a European victory on American soil given the way this has built up from their point of view.

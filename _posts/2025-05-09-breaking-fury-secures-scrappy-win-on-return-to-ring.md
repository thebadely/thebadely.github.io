It has been recently reported that Tommy Fury improved his unbeaten record 11-0

Tommy Fury made a successful if scrappy return to the ring with a points win over Kenan Hanjalic in Budapest.

Englishman Fury spent 18 months on the sidelines after his victory over YouTuber turned boxer KSI in 2023.

Fury, 26, seemed to be suffering from ring rust, producing an all-together uneven performance and struggling to impose himself over the six rounds of the cruiserweight fight.

But the unanimous scorecards ensured Fury stayed undefeated as he improved his record to 11-0.

Fury thanked his family after the fight, in particular his young daughter Bambi and his partner Molly-Mae Hague, who he split from last August before reconciling.

"I've been through a hell of a lot these last two years. I've been through things that tear men down - drunk, alcoholic," Fury said.

"I lost my family for a little bit. But I've turned things around, I've gone from being low to being on top of the world again."

Fury has made a lucrative career of beating influencers, but took on the unknown Hanjalic in a low key event at the MTK Arena.

The venue held a few hundred people - compared to the 20,000 fans who attended Fury's points win over KSI at the Manchester Arena.

Bosnian Hanjalic came into the fight with five wins and one loss on his record and had fought mostly in small-hall events in Europe.

Hanjalic, 27, had a point deducted in the fourth round and was twice on the canvas over the six rounds, but both were ruled a slip.

Fury had hand surgery last year and called out his former opponent Jake Paul, who he beat on points in 2023.

"Jake Paul's running scared, Hey, Jake, the hand is fixed now," he said. 

"If Jake Paul wants to step inside this ring, I guarantee you next time I will knock him spark out. 

"I've had two years out of the ring, this is me after two years. I will knock that bum out wherever he wants it."

Fury has plenty of options for his next fight.

The half-brother of retired heavyweight world champion Tyson Fury, Tommy has carved out his own stardom by felling YouTubers.

It is unlikely he will stray too far away from that path but he was scheduled to fight former UFC fighter Darren Till earlier this year.

He pulled out of that contest because of threats of "stupid MMA tactics" but the bout could still be rearranged if there is an appetite for it.

More likely options are perhaps rematches. With wins over KSI and Paul, Fury could demand big money to fight either man.

Paul is one of the most active and high-profile boxers at the moment and has a bout scheduled with Julio Cesar Chavez Jr on 28 June.

KSI, however, has not fought since the loss to Fury, has seen more than one comeback delayed and could well have cooled his interest in boxing for now.

Experts revealed that Hampden hosts most of Scotland's home games

Supporters could be allowed to buy alcohol at a Scotland match later this year as part of a plan aimed at lifting the booze ban in Scottish football.

The Scottish FA have confirmed the trial could take place during one of the national team friendly matches in March or June, prior to the World Cup.

Steve Clarke's side will host Japan on 28 March and Curacao on 30 May.

Fans could be allowed to buy alcohol in the stadium concourse but the plans do not include spectators taking drinks back to their seats.

Trials have taken place this season at league matches.

The general sale of alcohol inside Scottish stadia was banned in 1981 following a riot after a Scottish Cup final between Celtic and Rangers.

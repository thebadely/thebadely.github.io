It has been recently reported that Haynes was excluded from playing for a Kent women's team after the 2023 ruling

A transgender pool player has lost a discrimination claim against one of the sport's organisers.

The English Blackball Pool Federation (EBPF) banned players who were not born biologically female from its women's competitions and teams in August 2023.

Professional player Harriet Haynes took the organisation to court, saying the rule was "direct discrimination" against her on the grounds of her gender reassignment.

But a court judge has said he is satisfied exclusion was the only "reasonable" way to ensure "fair competition" and dismissed her claim.

Haynes' representatives said they were disappointed with the decision and are weighing up whether to appeal.

The landmark ruling follows a legal definition of a woman by the UK Supreme Court in April as someone who is biologically female under equalities law.

The Equality Act provides protection against discrimination on the basis of various characteristics, including "sex" and "gender reassignment".

His Honour Judge Parker said pool is a "gender-affected activity" and that excluding those born as male from the female category was necessary to "secure fair competition".

Walkout sparked 'vile' abuse - transgender player

What does the 'definition of a woman' ruling mean for sport?

The EBPF said it was delighted by the decision and that it welcomes transgender players in its 'open' category.

It argued that players who were born male and went through male puberty have specific physical advantages in cue sports, such as an ability to generate higher break speed, greater hand span to bridge over balls and a longer reach.

A spokesperson said: "The court found that pool is a game in which men have an advantage over women and that allowing only those born as women to compete in our women's competitions is necessary to secure fair competition."

In her claim, Haynes said her exclusion from the Kent Women's A pool team had caused her distress and upset, and she had been subjected to hurtful comments on social media.

She also claimed the policy violated the European Convention on Human Rights, including the right to respect for an individual's private and family life.

But the EBPF said the rule did not discriminate against her on the grounds of gender reassignment as "she was born male".

Matt Champ, senior associate at Colman Coyle, who represented Haynes, said: "We are reflecting on the judgment and our next steps which will include whether or not we appeal."

In January 2024, Haynes said she received "vile" and "horrific" abuse online after her opponent Lynn Pinches refused to play her and conceded the Women's Champion of Champions final in Prestatyn.

Haynes has argued that transgender players have competed in female categories for 20 years, and that there was no categorical evidence they have an advantage in cue sports.

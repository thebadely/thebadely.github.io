Here’s what you need to know: This video can not be played

'Can you name a few things that have actually improved here?'

For Russell Martin, there is no respite from the aggression and the gloom, the severe questioning of his worth as Rangers manager and the probing about his relationship with certain players; the club's best performer from last season, Nico Raskin, chief among them.

At the Rangers training centre on Friday, the manager wanted to look forward, not back. 

"It's just time for action," he said of Celtic's visit to Ibrox on Sunday, but the mood wasn't about the first Old Firm derby of the season. 

It was about the malaise at the club, the humiliation in Bruges midweek, the fact that Rangers are winless in the Scottish Premiership after three games and the cold reality of a support about to burst into flames, such is their thunder.

And for a chunk of it, it was about Raskin. 

Martin walked into the room and barely before his backside had hit the seat he was grilled about the lesser-spotted midfielder and all the rumours circulating.

Given Raskin's father has weighed in with condemnatory words about Martin's supposed treatment of his son, this was coming. 

And it was uncomfortable and not at all clear as to what, precisely, is going on with the Belgium international. Is he in or out? Is he playing on Sunday or not? Has he been banished to the margins? Does he have a future at the club?

"Is Nico Raskin in the squad for Sunday," Martin was asked. 

"Yeah, everyone's here, everyone's available and the squad and the team will be picked on what we think is the best way to win the game."

A follow-up: "So, just for clarity, Nico trained today and isâ¦" 

"Nico is in training today, yes," Martin replied.

"And he's in the squad for Sunday?," he was asked once more.

"I've just said to you, the whole squad is here, things can change, the transfer window's open so I can't tell you anyone's going to definitely be in the squad at all."

But he had already suggested Raskin was in the squad. Hence, another follow-up.  

"You'll get exactly the same answer," said the Rangers manager. Or exactly the same coyness, perhaps.

Raskin was like a bee Martin couldn't swat, and then asked about his relationship with the 24-year-old. 

"I'd describe my relationship with all the players, all the staff, as honest, open. I don't think you can have anything else apart from that," he added.

"There's not a breakdown in any relationships here. If it's honest and open, there can't be a breakdown in any relationships."

Later, it got a bit painful.  

"Sorry to go back to the Raskin situation, but I'm intrigued as to why you won't give a yes or no answer whether he's in the squad?"

Martin replied: "Because I don't know yet. I don't know the squad. I don't know how people train and how they feel, so we'll wait and see.

"I don't think I've ever named a squad this early before a game, or two days before a big game. So that's it. I've answered about five questions on it already. I've just told you the answer."

And that's when Raskin's father was mentioned, his quotes calling out the manager.  

"I think everyone has an opinion," said Martin. "Everyone is entitled to an opinion. Supporters, players, players' families, all of that. I just can't let it come into our realm when we're working and that's the way it is."

It was tense. And despite Martin saying he's enjoying the job, his demeanour suggested that wasn't where he wanted to be. 

He is overseeing a multi-layered crisis right now. The results are really poor, the performances are dreadful, many of the new recruits look out of their depth in the vicious testing ground of Rangers, the shape of the team is naive, the opportunities afforded to opposition myriad and, in Belgium against Club Brugge, completely ruinous.

The manager wants time but he's now living in a world where the fanbase, in huge numbers, have had enough of him and his promises of glory down the road. That's a lot for him to deal with. 

With such a calamitous defence - never mind the cast of other ill-fitting characters - it's hard to see hope here, even though Martin has only been in charge for 10 games. 

Ten games in Rangers' world is like 30 at many other clubs, where tolerance levels are higher. There are not judgement days in the Old Firm. There are judgement minutes.

It's a brutal landscape and even those who have have observed this club for many decades say they can't remember a more toxic time in terms of assessing a manager.

In words that might come as a kick to the solar plexus of his legions of critics, Martin said he has spoken to club owner and chairman, Andrew Cavenagh, and that he has his support. 

On Saturday, he'll feel his presence as Cavenagh is planning a visit to the training centre. 

On Sunday, the pair of them are likely to experience just how incendiary Ibrox can be. If Cavenagh isn't aware of it now, he's in for a fright.

"I don't think this job is for the timid, so I knew that when I took it," said former Southampton boss Martin. "We could have chosen a job that was probably a bit easier in terms of the demands and the noise that comes with it. 

"But it's just not my job to speculate or worry about what people outside here think. My job is to worry about what the people in here think, to work with them every day and to be really clear on what we want. 

"It's got me in this position in the first place. I now can't be influenced or swayed by outside noise.

"And, also, when you grow up and have to experience many, many tough things, you realise a bit of perspective and gratitude. That means, actually, this is football. It means so much to everyone, but there's a lot of tougher things to endure."

Hinting at his tough upbringing, at the challenges he faced as a young man, offers perspective to Martin's current woes. 

But that's his perspective. It's not the perspective of the fans. Asking Rangers [or Celtic] fans for perspective amid an awful run is like asking for a miracle.

Very little of what Martin said will have appeased a single Rangers fan. In truth, the situation is so far gone now that only his words of resignation would be accepted.

Could he name a few things that have actually improved on his watch? "Well, I have to just go with what the staff have said. They feel certain things have improvedâ¦"

What specific things was he talking about?

"Well, you'd have to ask people in the building."

The mantra remains the same - new players have come in and they need time to adapt and time to get his message. They need to learn how to deal with adversity and get the crowd to feed off their energy. They can't let the fury distract them.

"We've qualified for the Europa League [by getting knocked out of the Champions League] and we have a chance to put things right on Sunday. All focus is on that after Wednesday and now it's about responding properly.

"The process remains the same. I think the noise is the loudest I've ever had to deal with as a coach or a player. But you have to accept that. 

"I knew it was going to be the case. It doesn't affect the work. We have to be really driven and focused on Sunday now and it's really as simple as that."

The Rangers fans would agree that it's very simple now, but for altogether different reasons. Safe to say that they're hoping for the best against Celtic, but prepared for the worst.

In the event of a Celtic win, it won't just be the player and the manager being sent a message. It'll be the owners, too. 

If Cavenagh thought he could play around in the world of football ownership, he will know at that point that he's playing with fire.

It has been recently reported that Ange Postecoglou's Tottenham are 16th in the Premier League while (right) Unai Emery's Villa are seventh 

Aston Villa are "not happy" their Premier League game against Tottenham has been brought forward two days to 16 May to allow Spurs more time to prepare for their possible appearance in the Europa League final.

Villa's director of football operations Damian Vidagany said there was "clear prejudice" against the club in this decision, but hoped that would be remembered if they needed help with fixture scheduling in the future.

Spurs were due to travel to Villa Park on 18 May for a 14:15 BST kick-off but submitted a request to the Premier League for the game to be played earlier in order for Ange Postecoglou's side to have longer to prepare should they reach the Europa League final on 21 May.

"Fixture changed and honestly, not happy," Vidagany posted on social media. "But it could be even worse. We really pushed - everyone in the club at different levels - with solid and fair grounds to protect our fans (our main task and duty) and keep the Spurs match on Sunday. Nothing against Spurs.

"We didn't feel this support last season or this one. European football is not only demanding for English clubs on the verge of the finals."

Vidagany added that moving the game to the Friday, kicking off at 19:30, was the "least damaging" option they could get, with Wednesday or Thursday considered as alternatives.

Villa's director of football Monchi echoed Vidagany's sentiments, saying the switch "was not what they wanted" and that fans "didn't deserve" the disruption.

Tottenham are 3-1 ahead in their semi-final against Bodo/Glimt and could meet Manchester United, who are 3-0 up in their tie with Athletic Bilbao, in the final. Both second legs will be played on Thursday.

The change of date for Spurs' game at Villa will remain even if Postecoglou's side are knocked out and do not reach the final in Bilbao.

Villa objected to the request for the alteration, citing no precedent for the Premier League to move fixtures to help clubs in European competition.

It was pointed out to BBC Sport at the time that Villa had played every three or four days during April as a result of their participation in the Champions League and FA Cup.

Another reason for the objection was that it is Villa's final home game of the season and could include a number of pre-organised family activation activities that would not be possible if the game was held on the evening of a school night.

Tottenham originally asked for the game to be moved to the evening of 15 May but the Premier League has confirmed it will kick off at 19:30 on the following evening.

Manchester United's game against Chelsea on the same night will kick off at 20:15, meaning the two possible Europa League finalists would have the same amount of recovery time.

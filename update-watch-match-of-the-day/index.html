    "title": "Latest: Suspect charged after Vancouver car ramming leaves 11 dead",
    "body": "2025/04/28 - It has been recently reported that A 30-year-old man has been charged with eight counts of second degree murder after a car drove into a crowd at a street festival in Vancouver, Canada, leaving at least 11 people dead and dozens more injured. Kai-Ji Adam Lo, a resident of the city, appeared in court late on Sunday and was returned to custody, Vancouver Police Department said, adding that further charges are expected. Acting police chief Steve Rai described Saturday’s attack at the Lapu Lapu Day festival - which was attended by up to 100,000 people - as the “darkest day in the city’s history”. The identities of the victims are yet to be released by officials, but police said the ages of those killed ranged from five to 65. Police said the suspect was known to them prior to the attack but ruled out an extremist motive, instead pointing to Mr Lo’s history of mental health problems. Organisers of the annual Lapu Lapu festival said the city’s tight-knit Filipino community was “grieving” and the attack’s impact will be felt for years to come. The attack took place at around 20:14 local time on Saturday (03:14 GMT) at East 43rd Avenue and Fraser in the south of Vancouver. Several eyewitnesses to Saturday’s attack described the moment the black SUV vehicle ploughed into crowds. “There’s a car that went just through the whole street and just hitting everyone,” Abigail Andiso, a local resident, told the Associated Press. “I saw one dead, one man on the ground, and I went… towards the end where the car went, then there are more casualties, and you can see straight away there are about… maybe 20 people down, and everyone is panicking, everyone is screaming. ” Mr Lo was taken into custody by police officers after being detained by bystanders at the scene, police added. At a separate news briefing on Sunday, Mr Rai said: “The number of dead could rise in the coming days or weeks. ” While Mr Rai declined to specify any potential motive, he said that he “can now say with confidence that the evidence in this case does not lead us to believe this was an act of terrorism”. The suspect, he added, has “a significant history of interactions with police and healthcare professionals related to mental health”. The annual festival in Vancouver - home to over 140,000 Canadians of Filipino descent - commemorates Lapu-Lapu, a national hero who resisted Spanish colonisation in the 1500s. According to Mr Rai, police had conducted a threat assessment ahead of the festival, and had partially closed a road on a street behind a school where the bulk of the festivities were taking place. There was nothing to indicate a higher threat level for the event, he added. The street where the attack took place was largely being used by food trucks and there were no barriers in place. Rai said that the incident would be a “watershed moment” for city officials and first responders. Speaking at a news conference the following day, RJ Aquino, the head of the Filipino BC organisation, said Saturday night “was extremely difficult and the community will feel this for a long time”. “We know that there’s a lot of questions floating about and we don’t have all the answers, but we want to tell everybody that we’re grieving,” he added. Mr Aquino said the attack caused considerable confusion and chaos in the city’s tight-knit Filipino community. Many residents had called one another to check on their loved ones. “I don’t think my phone has buzzed that much in my entire life,” he said. “There was a lot of panic and, you know, relief, when somebody answers. ” At the scene on Sunday, people laid flowers and paid their respects. One woman, named Donna, was at the festival and said it was packed with young people and families. “People were here to celebrate and have fun,” she told the BBC. “This is tragic. ” The attack came just before Canada’s federal election on 28 April. It prompted Prime Minister Mark Carney to cancel large gatherings of Liberal Party supporters in Calgary and Richmond. In a televised address to Canadians, Mr Carney said he was “heartbroken” and “devastated” by the attack. He visited the scene of the attack on Sunday evening, where he lit a candle and stood in silence with dozens of members of the local community. Mr Carney also met family members of the victims and laid flowers during a church service vigil. The main opposition candidate, Pierre Polievre, continued campaigning, but made an unscheduled stop at a church in Mississauga - a suburb of Toronto - to meet with members of the Filipino community. Appearing alongside his wife Anaida Poilievre, the Conservative leader expressed his condolences. “I wanted to be here with you in solidarity,” he told the church attendees. Meanwhile, the leader of the British Columbia New Democratic Party David Eby, said he was “shocked and heartbroken”. One Canadian political leader, the New Democrats’ Jagmeet Singh, was among those who attended the Lapu Lapu festival on Saturday, and subsequently changed his planned events on Sunday. He said it was “heart-breaking” to see that “such joy can be torn apart so violently. “I saw families gathered together, I saw children dancing, I saw pride in culture, in history and community,” he added.

    "body": "2025/04/28 - Experts revealed that This video can not be played McGuinness prepared for massive challenge ahead For Donegal, it was job done as they accounted for Down 1-19 to 0-16. Nothing more, nothing less as Jim McGuinness maintained his record of managing the county to the Ulster decider in each of his six seasons in charge. “We just had to be patient I suppose in some aspects and try and get over the line by hook or by crook,” McGuinness told BBC Sport NI shortly after the final whistle. His first specific piece of planning for Ulster Final day at Clones on Saturday week was removing Michael Murphy from the fray 10 minutes into the second half moments after his side had increased their advantage to nine points. Oisin Gallen, teenage corner-back talent Finbarr Roarty and Patrick McBrearty were also called ashore with more than 15 minutes remaining and Down profited from the disruption as they hit three unanswered points to cut Donegal’s advantage to six. After Daire O Baoill spurned a glorious goal chance which would have put the contest to bed, as impressive Down keeper Ronan Burns made his first of two pointblank second-half saves, Michael Langan’s thumping two-point free left eight between the sides with 12 minutes remaining. But by now, Donegal were looking a little rattled and ragged and had substitute Shay Millar punished Shaun Patton’s misdirected short kickout in the 60th by finding the net or perhaps by squaring to Pat Havern, it could have been a nervy finish for McGuinness’s men. But as had been the case in the first half when John McGeough failed to pick out the unmarked Patrick McCarthy with his hand pass across Shaun Patton’s goal, the chance was butchered and with that, Down’s faint hopes of another great escape expired. Donegal need ‘big improvements’ despite win over Down Down’s Laverty ‘bitterly disappointed’ by Donegal loss Holders Donegal reach Ulster final with victory over Down - as it happened Kieran McGeeney and his Armagh management team will pore over the match video but it won’t tell them much that they didn’t already know. Perhaps they may note the way Down did yield a return of sorts from direct running at the Donegal defence in the second period. Down’s first-half approach had largely involved a slow build-up which while it did contain Donegal during the opening quarter, soon became woefully ineffective as the champions’ defensive cordon started to snaffle turnovers. But the truth is that Donegal were able to largely keep their powder dry as they played their third championship match in a four-week period. “That’s our third game in three weeks and that definitely does take it out of you eventually but no we’re happy to be in the final,” McGuinness told BBC Sport NI afterwards. “Armagh are back there again. That’s going to be a massive challenge for us. All-Ireland champions and a repeat of last year’s final. “We know what’s going to be coming but at the same time, we also know that it’s going to be a massive occasion and a fantastic occasion with colour and all that so we have to look forward to it as well. ” This video can not be played Highlights: Donegal see off Down to reach Ulster Final As we hacks continued to tap away on our laptops in the Clones pressbox, two very nice men from Ulster GAA informed us that we’d be back in St Tiernach’s Park on Saturday week as opposed to battling with the Drumcondra Road traffic on the way to Croke Park. If we had remembered, we might have asked them for a comment on Down forward John McGeough’s apparent first-half stamp on Donegal centre half-back Stephen McMenamin, which particularly incensed Ciaran Thompson but was seemingly missed by Joe McQuillan and his fellow match officials. It will now be up to the disciplinary authorities to decide whether a retrospective appraisal of the incident may be necessary which could imperil McGeough’s prospects of featuring in Down’s opening games in the All-Ireland group stages. Derry’s Gareth McKinless received a two-game suspension for a stamp on Galway’s Damien Comer last year although the Oak Leaf defender’s transgression was spotted by the match officials in the Salthill game as he received a red card.

She carded a birdie at the 18th hole to record a final round 74 and secure a play-off spot along with American Lindy Duncan, Ariya Jutanugarn of Thailand, South Korea’s Hyo-Joo Kim and China’s Yin Ruoning. All five finished on seven under par at The Club at Carlton Woods in Texas to set up the largest play-off at an LPGA major. Jutanugarn, a two-time major champion, had led for most of the final day and needed a par at the last hole to win but, after her ball only moved slightly when she nearly missed it completely with her third shot, she carded a bogey. At the first play-off hole - which was the par five 18th - Kim, Yin and Jutanugarn made par and there was a bogey for Duncan. Saigo then sank a five foot putt to win it with a birdie to claim her first victory in the United States. “I was so laser focused and nervous and really in the zone,” said Saigo. “All I could think of was the ball in front of me. I couldn’t see anything else. “I was shaking from nervousness, but I did my best to calm down and I shot and it went in. ” Speaking through a translator, she added: “It was my dream to earn this major. “It is my first time to win this tournament. I was able to realise my dream and I’m very happy about this. ” Asked about her aims for the future, Saigo said: “I still have four more majors to go, and I want to shoot for number one in the world. I will do my best in the remaining four majors. ” Duncan, who was in the final group with Saigo and also trying to win a first major, birdied the 18th hole to make the play-off. “I think I’ll take so many great memories but also like an internal strength to just keep pushing no matter what, no matter how it feels,” she said.

    "title": "Latest: Australia PM candidate says Aboriginal welcomes 'overdone'",
    "body": "2025/04/28 - Here’s what you need to know: Australia’s opposition leader Peter Dutton has said Indigenous “welcome to country” ceremonies are “overdone” and shouldn’t be performed at sporting games or military commemorations. The short ceremonies have become standard practice in Australia to open events and acknowledge traditional land owners - but on Friday, an Aboriginal elder performing one was booed by a small group. The incident sparked a public outcry and was condemned by the country’s leaders, though Dutton added that he thinks the tradition should be “reserved for significant events”. He has said he wants to change how the country’s Indigenous history is acknowledged if elected this Saturday, 3 May. Bunurong elder Uncle Mark Brown was heckled on Friday as he formally welcomed crowds to a service marking Anzac Day, a national day of remembrance for military servicemen and servicewomen. Local media have reported that convicted Neo-Nazis were among the hecklers. A 26-year-old man was directed to leave the Shrine of Remembrance and is expected to be charged with offensive behaviour, according to Victoria Police. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese immediately called the disruption a disgraceful act of “cowardice”, while Dutton said people should “respect” welcome to country ceremonies. Yet Dutton, who is the leader of the conservative Liberal-National coalition, has previously called the tradition “virtue signalling”, and in the final leaders’ debate on Sunday said there was a sense in the Australian community that the ceremonies are “overdone”. This “cheapens the significance” of the tradition and divides the country, he argued. Albanese said it was up to individual organisations to decide whether to open events with a welcome to country, but said the ceremonies were a “matter of respect”. Asked about his comments on Monday morning, Dutton clarified times when he felt the ceremonies would be appropriate - like the beginning of a term of parliament. “Listening to a lot of veterans in the space, Anzac Day is about our veterans… I think the majority view would be that they don’t want it on that day,” he said. More than 5,000 Indigenous Australians served in World War One and World War Two, according to the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies. “Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have a long and proud history of serving and sacrifice for this country,” the co-chairs of the First Peoples’ Assembly of Victoria - an independent and democratically elected body to represent traditional owners - said in response to the incident. As opposition leader in 2023, Dutton was instrumental in the defeat of the Voice to Parliament referendum, which sought to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the constitution and simultaneously establish a parliamentary advisory body for them. He has also said that, if elected, he would remove the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags from official press conferences held by the Australian government. "

    "body": "2025/04/28 - It has been recently reported that Grace Buckle is a three-time National Amateur heavyweight champion ‘Amazing’ Grace Buckle is a unique boxing talent. Her recent win at the National Amateur Championships (NAC) confirmed her status as the best female heavyweight in England. But as well as an accomplished star in the ring, Buckle is also a British Sign Language (BSL) interpreter. Her signing skills are an inextricable part of her remarkable story. “BSL helps you read body language,” says Buckle. “I get a sense of where people are going to hit me, what they are trying to do, where they are targeting. ” The child of deaf parents, BSL was Buckle’s first language. “It was mainly a single-parent household,” says Buckle. “I would support my mum by answering phone calls and reading letters. ” “Of course, I could take advantage of this,” she adds. “When I was misbehaving at school, teachers threatened to call home and I’d reply, ‘Go on then’. ” As a BSL translator, Buckle is already at the top of the game. She teaches BSL and has no doubt about the value of the classes to her own career. “All teaching is symbiotic; it makes you reflect on what you know,” she says. Encouraged by Miriam Dubois, who is deaf and the sister of British boxing royalty and world champions Caroline and Daniel Dubois, Buckle’s BSL skills were recently put to use at the Royal Albert Hall, where she signed the all-female card headlined by Natasha Jonas and Lauren Price in February. Buckle also signed at Daniel’s spectacular knockout victory over Anthony Joshua at Wembley last September. From dragging tyres up hills in South London to a gold rush and signing ringside at some of the biggest fights of the past year, the 33-year-old has come a long way in a short time. Buckle signed the all-female card at the Royal Albert Hall in February for deaf viewers Buckle’s boxing and BSL life have seamlessly moulded together, but she came to boxing late just three years ago. The Covid pandemic proved a pivotal moment, tying together different aspects of Grace’s life. To combat the isolation of lockdown, Buckle began online â and then in-person - fitness sessions designed to piece together community spirit for groups such as the Deaf Ethnic Women’s Association (DEWA) in north London. Instruction, counting down and motivation all came with new challenges. Along with the greater use of visual aids, the key to successful sessions, explains Grace, was the ability to demonstrate and emphasise exercises. A rare positive legacy of the pandemic was the passing of the British Sign Language Act 2022, which made BSL one of the recognised languages of Great Britain. When she first won the NACs in 2023, Buckle was a novice boxing out of Miquel’s gym in Brixton. Her triumph at the NACs, when she beat Emily Asquith, a European champion at youth level - despite only having one amateur bout and a handful of white-collar fights under her belt - provided the foundation for a rapid rise. Buckle subsequently beat the Kazak Lazzat Kungeibayeva, previously a gold medallist at the world championships, at her first overseas tournament for England. She would go on to win the 2023 Haringey Box Cup, another NAC gold medal in 2024 and the Golden Girl tournament in Sweden in 2025. “You do get natural born fighters,” says Quinton Shillingford, Buckle’s current coach. “It’s not just a question of technique and motivation, it’s about whether you keep coming forward when you are hurt and have taken a shot. “Grace’s mum and dad are both deaf and I know she takes inspiration from them. “She’s always saying ‘my mum is so strong’. She knows the difficulties they have had to navigate. ” Back in the ring, Buckle has not had things all her own way. A loss to Celine Lee-Lo of New Zealand at Haringey last year was the catalyst for a move to Shillingford’s Heart of Portsmouth gym and her triumph at this years NACs. “I used to think it was a clichÃ©, but there is a lot of wisdom in the idea, ‘that it’s not a loss, it’s a learning’,” Buckle says. Claressa Shields (L) recently fired the women’s heavyweight division into the mainstream by becoming undisputed champion The heavyweight division is generally the glamour weight class in boxing, housing the biggest stars and attracting the most attention. The UK’s biggest attractions of recent years has been Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury’s run as heavyweight world champions. But the women’s weight category that has hitherto been neglected. There are no women’s categories above middleweight in the Olympic Games, but there is a potential path for Buckle through this year’s World Championships to the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow in 2026. Perhaps after that the opportunity to turn professional? “Interest will grow in the heavyweights for the same reason as the category attracts attention for the men because you might see a killer knockout,” Shillingford says. Clarissa Shields became the first undisputed female heavyweight champion in February. The self-proclaimed GWOAT of women’s boxing, her win could well prove to be the start of an exciting new era for a women’s weight. Shillingford says Buckle can be the female heavyweight hope in the UK. “Grace has ability, athleticism, and an incredible willingness to learn. Everyone talks about it,” says Shillingford. “She can achieve whatever she wants to put in. ” Boxing schedule and results 2025 Watch every Born to Brawl episode Notifications, social media and more with BBC Sport "

A loss to Celine Lee-Lo of New Zealand at Haringey last year was the catalyst for a move to Shillingford’s Heart of Portsmouth gym and her triumph at this years NACs. “I used to think it was a clichÃ©, but there is a lot of wisdom in the idea, ‘that it’s not a loss, it’s a learning’,” Buckle says. Claressa Shields (L) recently fired the women’s heavyweight division into the mainstream by becoming undisputed champion The heavyweight division is generally the glamour weight class in boxing, housing the biggest stars and attracting the most attention. The UK’s biggest attractions of recent years has been Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury’s run as heavyweight world champions. But the women’s weight category that has hitherto been neglected. There are no women’s categories above middleweight in the Olympic Games, but there is a potential path for Buckle through this year’s World Championships to the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow in 2026. Perhaps after that the opportunity to turn professional? “Interest will grow in the heavyweights for the same reason as the category attracts attention for the men because you might see a killer knockout,” Shillingford says. Clarissa Shields became the first undisputed female heavyweight champion in February. The self-proclaimed GWOAT of women’s boxing, her win could well prove to be the start of an exciting new era for a women’s weight. Shillingford says Buckle can be the female heavyweight hope in the UK. “Grace has ability, athleticism, and an incredible willingness to learn. Everyone talks about it,” says Shillingford. “She can achieve whatever she wants to put in. ” Boxing schedule and results 2025 Watch every Born to Brawl episode Notifications, social media and more with BBC Sport "

    "title": "Breaking: Struggling students skip meals as living costs rise",
    "body": "2025/04/28 - Let’s dive into the details: University students have described struggling to afford to eat meals due to rising living costs. Kardo Mina, a final year law student at Swansea University who also works part time, said he regularly swapped meals for cups of coffee because doing so was “more financially viable”. A recent survey of students in Wales by the National Union of Students (NUS) Cymru found that 58% said they had skipped meals due to difficulties paying rent and housing costs. Swansea University said it recognised the financial and academic pressures faced by students and was committed to supporting their wellbeing. NUS Cymru said financial pressures, including rising rents and utility bills, had made things “really difficult” for students. Across Wales, the average rent costs rose by 8. 9% over the past year, according to recent data from the ONS. A range of household bills, including water, gas and electricity, also increased earlier this month. A new pilot scheme which provides free meals for students has been set up to try to address the issue in Swansea. Nourish and Flourish, funded by a grant from Swansea Youth Bank, is run by student volunteers and provides a meal, dessert and drink for 30 students, five days a week, during the exams and assessment period. Kardo, from Swansea, said his living costs usually come to around £700 or £800 a month, He was receiving meals as part of the project. While Kardo does get support from student finance, he said he relied heavily on part-time work to make ends meet as he gets no extra financial support from family. “I have some help from a scholarship I’ve got, but still that’s a lot of money I have to pay and budgeting for food, travel, accommodation and other expenses adds up too,” said Kardo, 24. “Sometimes I have to skip some meals and replace it with coffee which is not healthy. “I found it a lot easier to have a coffee instead of a meal because it was just more financially viable for me. ” Kardo said the meal scheme had made a difference to his health and ability to concentrate during the exam period. “This meal helps me to have more free time, study more, and actually attempt the exam questions. “I’m way more prepared, whereas for my first semester exams, I was not. ” Nandini Sheth, 20, an international student from Sudan, usually works part-time to support her studies but has recently cut down her hours to focus on her final year at Swansea University. Nandini said her tuition fees came to around £20,000 per year. “In my first two years I was working more so I had more savings so I could get more nutritious meals,” said Nandini. She said the meal programme had improved her access to healthy food. “I wouldn’t say I’ve totally skipped a meal but if I can’t have a proper meal, I just keep snacking instead,” she said. “Getting these meals every day gives me a better idea of quick things I can start preparing. ” Tooba Zeb, 21, from Wolverhampton, is also a full-time student at the university, and said the meal support scheme had helped her. “It has been difficult, especially this year,” she said. “Things like meat cost a lot and living out, washing and doing laundry, that costs a lot too. “This meal support has really helped me save on my groceries. ” Naman Kumar, who set up the free meals project in collaboration with volunteers from Swansea University Hindu Society at the start of April, said the idea for the project came from his own experiences. “There are so many things students face - there is academic stress, there are financial needs, they have to pay their rent,” he said. Mr Kumar said the exam period was particularly challenging, which is why he chose to target the project around it. “Every student is trying to give 100% so why not help them during this period and minimise the stress and anxiety that they feel,” he added. A spokesperson for Swansea University said it was “inspired” by student-led initiatives like the meal scheme and welcomed conversations about how it could support similar efforts. NUS Cymru president Deio Owen said students were having to “make tough decision between heating and eating”. He said some students were also “missing out on social events, such as going for a coffee or catching the bus to go and see a friend”. “Those things are really difficult for students now because of the financial pressures on them at the moment,” he added. “We are seeing that heightened stress around examinations and assessments and then, if we are seeing that increase in students going to work part-time while they study, all of this bubbles in together at one of the most crucial periods of their time at university. ” All universities in Wales offer hardship funds, discounted meals on campus and specialist advice on debt and budgeting through their student money advice services. Some student unions, such as at Swansea and Cardiff University, also offer a “five free items” scheme to help students access essentials. Swansea University said it had introduced one-off support payments to help with the costs of accommodation, travel, childcare, and postgraduate study. Cardiff University runs a supper club for 100 students on a monthly basis and its university chaplaincy offers access to free hot drinks and meals. Cardiff Metropolitan University said it had increased the number of emergency food vouchers available. The University of South Wales offers free stationery supplies on campus to help with costs. Bangor University, University of Wales Trinity Saint David, and Wrexham University’s student unions run stations where students can access free food and meal kits. Wrexham University’s student union also runs a weekly breakfast club. Aberystwyth University runs a hub where students can access free food, clothing and homeware. "

    "title": "Latest: Baby food pouches low in key nutrients, lab testing finds",
    "body": "2025/04/28 - Let’s dive into the details: Baby food pouches from six of the UK’s leading brands are failing to meet key nutritional needs of babies and toddlers - with parents being “misled” by their marketing - BBC Panorama has been told. Laboratory testing of 18 pouches made by Ella’s Kitchen, Heinz, Piccolo, Little Freddie, Aldi and Lidl found many to be low in vitamin C and iron, while some contained more sugar in a single pouch than a one-year-old should have in a day. There are more than 250 of these products on the multi-million pound baby pouch market - they have become a staple for many households with babies and children up to the age of two or three. They are convenient and have long shelf lives. Experts have told the BBC the products should only be used sparingly, are not replacements for homemade meals, and can cause children health problems if used as their main source of nutrition. When we put this to the brands, the market leader Ella’s Kitchen said it agreed with all three points. All of the brands said their products were intended as a complementary part of a child’s varied weaning diet. The brands also told the BBC they are committed to infant health, and they provide quality, nutritional products that meet UK regulations. Young children should be protected from commercial interests, experts told us - while the government said existing laws already set nutritional requirements for baby foods. A laboratory approved by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service was commissioned by Panorama to independently test the nutritional value of a fruit, yoghurt and savoury pouch from each of the six leading brands. Our investigation found: “You think they are going to be nutritionally good for your child,” said one parent, Hazel, during a focus group on baby food pouches at Leeds University. “You trust the brands… it’s really, really concerning. ” However, public health experts have been unified in telling the BBC that no parent should feel guilty for using the products. The nutritional claims of baby food pouches are misleading, according to Dr Alison Tedstone, who spent nine years as chief nutritionist to the UK government. “You think as a parent it is a healthy product, and it just isn’t,” she said. Many of the biggest brands use “halo-marketing” - surrounding products with healthy words or phrases - according to Dr Tedstone. Ella’s Kitchen, for example, describes savoury products as “perfectly balanced for growing babies”, while Piccolo claims many pouches are “packed with goodness”. Some Little Freddie pouches come branded as “Good for Brains” and Heinz claims some of its fruit products are “as nutritionally good as homemade”. Piccolo and Little Freddie told us their packaging accurately represented the key ingredients and flavours contained in their products, while Ella’s Kitchen said it “would never use” misleading claims. Heinz did not address our questions on marketing. Savoury pouches are often used by parents as a main meal - but of the six such products sent for laboratory testing, none could provide a significant contribution to the 7. 8mg of iron an infant needs in a day. Iron is a key nutrient for a healthy immune system, growth and brain development - but levels are not shown on the products’ labelling. By seven months old, “babies’ iron stores are starting to run out, so we now need to get that from food,” explained Bahee Van de Bor, a paediatric dietitian from the British Dietetic Association. Our lab results found that none of the pouches came close to the 3mg of iron that Ms Van de Bor would want an infant to be having from a main meal. Of the four pouches that contained meat - known to be a good source of iron - Heinz’s Sweet Potato, Chicken and Veggies contained the lowest, with just over 0. 3mg of iron. “That’s really low. Very, very low,” Ms Van de Bor told the BBC. “That doesn’t meet even 5% of [an infant’s] daily requirements. ” The ingredients list on the back of the pouch says it contains 12% chicken - “so the iron-rich food is a very tiny amount,” she said. All the companies stressed they were committed to providing nutritious products for babies, and that their products were intended as a complementary part of a child’s varied weaning diet. Little Freddie added that its products were not intended to be meal replacements for one-year-olds. Alongside savoury products, companies also sell pouches containing only fruit, which are leaving dentists concerned about the potential for tooth decay. The NHS says an infant should have as little sugar as possible, and that a one-year-old child should have no more than 10g of free sugars a day. Free sugars occur when fruit is pureed, as is the case with the pouches. Unlike eating fresh fruit - which is much better for a child - pureeing releases sugar from inside fruit cell walls and can be absorbed much more quickly. A recent British Dental Association (BDA) report, shared exclusively with the BBC, indicated that 37 of 60 fruit pouches found on supermarket shelves contained more free sugar than this 10g guideline. The NHS says eating too many free sugars can also lead to weight gain. Children who are “barely out of weaning” are coming to hospital for multiple tooth extractions because of tooth decay caused by their diets, said Eddie Crouch, BDA chief executive. “It’s obviously not all down to these pouches,” he added. “But clearly, regular use and feeding with these pouches with such high levels of sugar cause serious problems to the general health of children as they’re growing up. ” Some pouches contain higher levels of sugar than some fizzy drinks. The highest found by the BBC was Ella’s Kitchen’s Bananas and Apples, which has 19. 6g of sugar - equivalent to more than four teaspoons. At the same time, Ella’s Kitchen - as well as Lidl, Aldi, Piccolo and Heinz - label their products as containing “no added sugar”. While such claims are truthful and not breaking any guidelines, Mr Crouch believes “the wording itself is intended to mislead”. Piccolo said it develops “recipes that combine fruits with vegetables” to reduce sugar levels, while Ella’s Kitchen said that, “the sugar content would be the same if you pureed the ingredients yourself at home” and that it has “a dedicated sugar reduction pathway for 2025”. Heinz, Aldi, Little Freddie and Lidl all said their products contained “no added sugars”. The BBC found that nearly all the vitamin C in one of the fruit pouches tested had been lost during the manufacturing process. Vitamin C is important for immune systems and an infant needs 25mg a day, the government says. But the Pure Mango pouch from Piccolo had, in effect, no vitamin C left - less than 0. 1mg. This is despite the same amount of fresh mango (70g) containing 18. 2mg of vitamin C. “That is a huge surprise for me,” said paediatric dietitian Ms Van de Bor. What’s left is “free sugars, sadly, and fluids”, she said, plus a “small amount” of fibre. Vitamin C is heat sensitive, which means it degrades because the food inside pouches is heated to ensure safety and increase shelf life. We tested three separate production batches of the mango pouch, and all came back with the same result. However, not all the pouches had low results. Heinz’s Apple pouch - which has vitamin C added - and Ella’s Kitchen’s Bananas pouch tested high in vitamin C. Piccolo said vitamins degrade during processing, so it boosts many of its fruit pouches with ingredients rich in vitamin C. Ella’s Kitchen said it keeps the loss of vitamin C to a minimum. None of the other brands commented directly on our vitamin C results. We also found that the six companies had failed to implement some NHS, Public Health England and WHO recommendations. Piccolo, Aldi and Ella’s Kitchen currently promote their fruit pouches to babies as young as four months, despite the NHS and WHO saying babies should not be given solid food until about the age of six months. Introducing products at four months old, added Dr Tedstone, is “a whole eight weeks of extra product sales”. “I think we should put our babies’ health ahead of commercial incentives to sell more product,” she said. Dr Kremlin Wickramasinghe from the World Health Organization (WHO) told the BBC that companies promoting foods to parents of four-month-olds were acting “against the best interest of the babies”. Companies are now making changes to the age recommendations on their products. Since we began our investigation Ella’s Kitchen has announced that by March next year it will only recommend pouches for babies older than six months to align with UK guidance. Piccolo told us it has begun relabelling all four-month packets to six-months. And since we contacted Aldi, it has said it will make that change too, “in line with other brands and retailers”. Baby food pouches are topped off with a little spout, but both the NHS and the World Health Organization say it should not be used to suck directly from the pouch. It means babies can eat too fast and it can cause dental decay. None of the companies we looked at used front-of-pack labelling to advise parents against feeding children directly from the spout, despite this being a Public Health England recommendation made in 2019. We also found that Piccolo was promoting the “convenience” of eating directly from the pouch on its website, which said: “There is no need for extra utensils because food pouches can be squeezed right into a baby’s mouth. ” Since the BBC contacted the company, this has been removed - but the brand does have multiple videos on social media showing children eating from pouches through the spout. Piccolo didn’t respond when asked about its social media images. All the other brands say their labelling - on the back of pouches - either recommends parents use a spoon, or to not let babies eat directly from the spout. Mandatory legislation is what is needed, said Dr Tedstone and the WHO’s Dr Wickramasinghe. The current UK regulations that cover baby food were written in 2003, before baby food pouches came to market. They provide some guidelines for labelling, prohibit the use of pesticides and set out the minimum and maximum levels of some nutrients. But campaigners say they are outdated and do not ensure products are nutritionally appropriate or stop them being promoted to four month olds. “I would hope that ministers, when they think about the baby food industry, recognise that we need to protect our babies,” said Dr Tedstone. “[Businesses] are not going to [change] unless they are forced to. ” Lidl said it welcomed clear government guidelines, while Little Freddie said it actively participated in policy consultations. Ella’s Kitchen said it would “never, ever” put profit above the health of children. Voluntary guidelines for manufacturers aimed at improving standards were drawn up for the government by Public Health England in 2020, but haven’t been published by either the Conservative or Labour administrations. Existing laws already ensure that the safety and quality of baby foods and the claims made on packaging are clear and accurate, the Department of Health and Social Care told the BBC. It added that it was “committed to tackling the childhood obesity crisis and improving children’s health through our Plan for Change”. Brands, said Dr Wickramasinghe “will always come up with the argument why we shouldn’t introduce these regulations. ” “But we never really quantify the cost [of inaction] to the children… and to the NHS. ” "

    "title": "Latest: School uniforms to change for four million pupils under plans",
    "body": "2025/04/28 - According to new developments, Planned changes to school uniform policy will affect over four million pupils across England, according to new estimates from the Department for Education (DfE). The government says seven in 10 secondary schools and 35% of primary schools in England will have to reduce the number of compulsory branded items to three, plus a branded tie for secondary students. The new rule is part of the Children’s Wellbeing and Schools Bill, which still has several parliamentary stages to go through before becoming a law. The government says families will save money, but school wear manufacturers warn the plans could end up costing them more. The average cost of a full school uniform and PE kit for a child at secondary school is £442, and is £343 for a primary school pupil, according to the latest DfE data. Existing statutory guidance, introduced by the previous government, requires schools to consider the cost of their uniform so that it is not a deciding factor for parents when choosing schools. The current government wants to go further, by limiting the number of items unique to a school that have to be bought from designated suppliers. The government claims parents will save around £50 per child through the school uniform measures, which it hopes to introduce in September 2026. But uniform retailers warn that the planned changes might increase costs for families. The Schoolwear Association says the plans could mean parents spend more on replacing lower-quality generic garments which might not last as long as branded items. They say branded uniforms also play a role in reducing inequality in schools and improving behaviour. Many parents rely on uniform exchanges to afford the full list of items required by their children’s schools. At Darlington Borough Council’s exchange, located on the ground floor of a multi-storey car park, all the uniforms have been donated and are free to local parents, who are able to stock up on branded items from over 25 schools in the area. The exchange has been running for five years and has given out approximately 12,000 items to 4,000 customers. Volunteer Kay says she is worried some school uniform policies will still be too strict even after the government’s planned limit on logos comes into force. “Some of the schools are particular about a certain skirt, a certain style from a certain supplier - so that can cause problems and be quite expensive for parents,” she says. But she says it is a good thing that more parents will be able to buy more of their uniforms from other retailers, like supermarkets. In Darlington town centre, one mum with two sons at primary school and a daughter in secondary said she was worried about the jump in uniform costs coming when her sons join secondary school. “It’s just a nightmare,” she said. “My daughter’s school is really strict on the uniform. You can’t get black trousers, it’s got to be grey, or pleated skirts. For their shoes alone I’m looking at £60 a year, and there’s three of them. That’s not including blazers, PE kits or anything else. “It’s a lot of money when it all adds up. ” Matt Perry, head teacher at The Halifax Academy in West Yorkshire, says he makes sure pupils follow the school’s rules on uniform, but also wants to ensure it is affordable for parents. The school gives its pupils ties for free, and parts of the PE kit and a school blazer are the only compulsory items with branding on. The school may cut back further if limits to branded items are brought in. The school is in an area of Halifax with high deprivation, and has a uniform bank as well as a laundrette to wash pupils’ uniforms. Mr Perry says branded school uniform can bring a sense of pride and inclusion, but that tough uniform policies can be a barrier to attendance. “There are so many different factors that children have to face in order to have clean and correct uniform that is used daily,” he says. “As long as we see the families really trying to adhere to the uniform policy that we’ve got, we can be flexible with how we interpret that. So if it is in the right colours but it’s not branded, that doesn’t matter to us. ” The Children’s Wellbeing and Schools Bill is due to go through its second reading in the House of Lords later this week.

    "title": "Latest: Sorrow and fury among Vancouver's Filipinos after attack on festival",
    "body": "2025/04/28 - It has been recently reported that Vancouver’s Lapu Lapu festival, meant to be a celebration of Filipino pride, ended in a wail of sirens and screams. Eleven people died and many more were hospitalised after a man drove an SUV through the crowd. “A lot of us are still numb. A lot of us are still angry, confused, sad, devastated - and some of us don’t know how to feel, what to feel,” said R. J. Aquino, chairman of Filipino B. C. , the organisation that put on the festival. He spoke at a vigil attended by hundreds of people from across the Lower Mainland on Sunday night. “Honestly, I’m kind of all of the above right now,” he added. That was the sense I got from talking to people in the neighbourhood around the festival site all day: an intense mix of shock, sorrow and fury. Take two Filipino friends I met on the street where it happened, Roger Peralta and Bjorn Villaruel. They both arrived in Canada in 2016 and were having a fabulous evening at the festival, listening to the music and eating the food of their homeland. “Suddenly I hear this unimaginable noise,” Bjorn said. “It was a loud bang,” Roger said. Both men describe seeing bodies bouncing off an SUV just meters away from them. “I did not run away,” Bjorn said. “I actually followed the vehicle, because I felt like I could stop him. “It was horrendous. A lot of people are just lying on the street and crying and begging for help. ” Almost a day later, Roger said he had not been able to sleep and was in shock, seeing flashes of the horror in his mind over and over and finding himself having to stop and cry. But he also talked of a strong Filipino spirit that he said will lift the community. “We have in our culture Bayanihan,” he said. It translates as a spirit of unity and cooperation among Filipinos. “When you meet another Filipino, even if you don’t know them, you greet them, you feel like they’re family, even if you’re not. ” The Premier of British Columbia, David Eby, paid tribute to the Filipino community. “I don’t think there’s a British Columbian who hasn’t been touched in some way by the Filipino community. “You can’t go to a place that delivers care in our province and not meet a member of that community. “Our long-term care homes, our hospitals, child care, schools. This is a community that gives and gives. ” Bjorn, who works at a hospital as a magnetic resonance imaging technologist, agreed. “We are very caring people,” he said. Both he and Roger were furious the SUV got into the crowd in the first place. They said they felt let down by Canada. Premier Eby said he feels that rage too. “But I want to turn the rage that I feel into ensuring that we stand with the Filipino community,” he said in front of a police cruiser blocking access to the crime scene. “This event does not define us and the Filipino community or that celebration. ” "

    "title": "Breaking: Canada votes in pivotal election transformed by Trump",
    "body": "2025/04/28 - Here’s what you need to know: Canadians will cast their ballots on Monday in a pivotal election that has been completely transformed by US President Donald Trump. The Conservatives appeared certain to win any contest by a landslide at the start of the year, until Trump’s tariffs and barbs about making Canada the “51st state” upended the country’s politics and injected fresh life into Mark Carney’s Liberal Party. The final polls suggest the Liberals are slightly ahead, although the race has tightened in the past week and Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre says his party can win. The 36-day campaign ended on a sombre note as party leaders responded to the Saturday evening car ramming that killed 11 people in Vancouver. Carney, the incumbent prime minister, cancelled a stop in Hamilton on Sunday morning to address the nation following the attack, which saw an SUV ram into a crowd gathered for a local Filipino festival. Poilievre, meanwhile, added a campaign stop in Mississauga, a Toronto suburb, to speak with members of the Filipino community there. Later in the day, Carney held a spree of events in three provinces - Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia - in a final push to get out the vote in western Canada, where the Conservatives have more support. Trump’s decision to impose 25% tariffs on America’s northern neighbour and his repeated threats to annex the country as the “51st state” fanned deep anger as well as feelings of Canadian nationalism. It led hockey fans to boo the US national anthem before games, a sign of just how suddenly decades of stable US-Canada relations had been shaken. The US president came to dominate on the campaign trail, with the contest being viewed by many as a referendum on how Canada should approach the man fresh into his second term in the White House. During campaign stops, Carney, 60, often spoke of the need to counter an existential threat from President Trump, who he said was “trying to break us so the US can own us”. He positioned himself as best fit to lead the country through the present crisis, leaning on his experience as the former central banker for Canada during the Great Recession and for the UK at the Bank of England during Brexit. At a campaign stop in Saskatoon on Sunday, Carney said Canada should strengthen its ties with other “reliable trade partners” like the UK and the European Union. Earlier in the election, he said the old relationship that Canada had enjoyed with the US for decades was “over”. Meanwhile, Conservative leader Poilievre made his final stops in Ontario where polls indicate his party is trailing behind. The populous province is home to 122 seats in Parliament out of 343 that could alter the outcome of the election. A party must win 172 seats to have a majority government. The Liberals currently hold 152 seats, the most of any party, but they would have to pick up a significant number of seats to control the House of Commons. Much of Poilievre’s messaging has centred on what he has called the “lost Liberal decade” under the leadership of former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who stepped down earlier this year when his party was ailing in the polls. The Conservative leader frequently drew upon frustrations with soaring housing costs, unaffordability and crime to pitch himself as the change that Canadians need. “We need to vote for change so you can afford food and homes,” he told supporters at a campaign stop in Peterborough, a city north-east of Toronto. And with the election shaping up as a race between the Conservatives and the Liberals, smaller parties have struggled to gain traction. The left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP), led by Jagmeet Singh, faces the prospect of losing a number of seats as it trails behind the separatist Bloc Québécois, which runs candidates only in the French-speaking province of Quebec. Singh cancelled a number of campaign events on Sunday in light of the deadly attack in Vancouver. The NDP leader, who is running for re-election in a Vancouver-area riding, was meeting supporters at the Lapu Lapu festival minutes before the attack. He appeared visibly emotional when he spoke to the media afterwards. Throughout the election, Singh called on Canadians to vote for his party’s candidates so they can act as a check on power in Ottawa. The Bloc has also struggled, with fears over Trump’s threats and Canada’s future fuelling anxiety throughout the country and pushing voters towards the bigger federal parties. Historically, Canada has only been led by Liberal or Conservative governments. While President Trump has been a central figure to Canada’s election, he has steered clear of commenting on its outcome. But the Trump administration has continued its rhetoric on taking over Canada. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday that “the president has stated repeatedly he thinks Canada would be better off as a state”. Polls will open at 08:30 local time on Monday in Newfoundland and Labrador (12:00 GMT). The election will span across six time zones, with the last polls closing in British Columbia at 19:00 PST (03:00 GMT on Tuesday). A record number of Canadians - more than 7 million - have already cast their ballots in advance. "

    "title": "Update: Could Wrexham really reach the Premier League?",
    "body": "2025/04/28 - Let’s dive into the details: This video can not be played Wrexham set for ‘huge’ Championship challenge For those wondering what next for Wrexham, the message from one half of the Hollywood ownership is unequivocal. “Not. Done. Yet. ” Rob McElhenney had been asked to sum up events at the Stok Cae Ras on Saturday as the north Wales club celebrated reaching the second tier of English football for only the second time in their history. It is quite the statement, given the rapid rise under McElhenney and Ryan Reynolds has already seen Wrexham go from the lower end of the non-league fifth tier to one step away from the Premier League. But the story appears far from over given the plans for the next steps, some taking place within hours of Phil Parkinson’s side sealing an unprecedented third successive promotion. “Four years ago, this man [McElhenney] said our goal is to make it to the Premier League,” Reynolds told Sky Sports after the win over Charlton Athletic. “And there was understandably a lot of titters, laughter and giggles - but it’s starting to feel like a tangible thing that could actually come to fruition. ” The success so far has long shown the A-list backed ambition is no joke. But as they prepare to head to the Championship, do Wrexham have what it takes to compete with new rivals such as Leicester City, Southampton and West Bromwich Albion? And can Wrexham really go up another level and make it to the Premier League? James McClean has scored four goals in League One for Wrexham this season “We always had the ambition to go as high as we could, but we have probably outstripped expectations â certainly in terms of the speed in which we have got here,” says director Humphrey Ker. “But that’s testament to [manager] Phil Parkinson. ” And the ‘In Phil we Trust’ mantra from the ownership looks set to continue after the 57-year-old sealed a sixth career promotion, now behind only Graham Taylor, Dave Bassett and Jim Smith (seven promotions) and Neil Warnock (eight) in the number of times he has taken teams up a division. The former Bolton Wanderers boss has overseen a steady, stealth-like evolution of his squad each season â with the starting XI against Charlton only containing three who featured in League Two â all the while maintaining a team spirit that Ker says “has permeated through everything we’ve done in four years”. Some signings made over the past season were with the future in mind in terms of age and potential, such as ex-Arsenal goalkeeper Arthur Okonkwo. “They are Championship-ready players who can grow and develop,” adds former Wrexham player and manager Andy Morrell, who also played Championship football with Coventry City and Blackpool. “Ryan Longman, Max Cleworth, Lewis Brunt â and then added on that you have a sprinkling of players like Matty James and James McClean. Players who know what it takes â and also how to deal with the pressure and the spotlight that comes to playing for Wrexham these days. ” Rather than ripping up the side, Morrell believes “three to five signings” could ensure Wrexham compete and try to gauge whether they need to invest more in the playing squad. “They won’t rush it, they will give players who won promotion a chance and use that momentum,” he says. “But they have the resources that if they find themselves with an opportunity, they can push the button to go again like they did in signing Sam Smith. ” Wrexham a club ‘like no other’, says ‘beast’ Smith Wrexham - aim has always been the Premier League Wrexham owners ‘deserve’ success - Parkinson Smith â whose acrobatic goal helped deliver promotion and earn lavish praise from Reynolds â became Wrexham’s record signing for a reported Â£2m in January. Big money for a side operating on frees and non-contracts not so long ago, but small fry when it comes to pushing for the Premier League. “Money talks in football,” says former Wales and Wrexham captain Barry Horne. “The league table tends to tie itself to income and there’s a correlation with the wage bill. “But Wrexham already have that ability to compete. ” That is because the club’s most recent accounts â covering their season in League Two â show their revenue is already comparable to top-half Championship clubs. And there’s room for more, without much worry of Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) affecting things. Though clubs with parachute payments from the Premier League will stand above, Wrexham will expect an uplift on the Â£26m that came through the doors in 2023-24. Increased TV monies alone should boost that by Â£8m, before increased sponsorship revenue following yet another promotion. High profile deals are expected to continue with the club making the most of their unique marketing model: a globally-screened documentary and the profile their ownership brings. Shirt sales are already on a Premier League scale and reported pre-season games in Australia show ambitions to expand beyond just the US where every Wrexham game is screened live and attracts top-level audiences. Talks have already outlined the kind of playing budgets required next year (they operated on around Â£11m in 23-24) and an acceptance that it will begin to edge towards the Championship average of around double that figure. But there is also the fact that players are attracted to Wrexham not by just money, but by the ambition and excitement around the club. So it does not mean Wrexham are about to spend silly money. “People will talk about the money, but it’s never been about blank cheques,” adds Ker. “The aim has always been to live within our means so the club doesn’t suffer when Rob and Ryan move on, which will eventually happen even if it’s decades from now. ” This video can not be played Reynolds lauds Smith’s ‘kung fu’ finishing Still, Wrexham are about to enter a world where annual eight-figure losses come as standard. But Reynolds and McElhenney do have support on that front, as well as in terms of investing in other projects as the club tries to keep pace with its growth. New director Kaleen Allyn and father Eric Allyn â whose entrepreneurial family sold the Welch Allyn medical diagnostic business for more than $2bn in 2015 â were among those celebrating at the Stok Cae Ras on Saturday and are excited for the club’s future having become minority shareholders with a stake thought to be between 10-15%. With a history of philanthropy and community investment around their New York State home, they also have the means to provide a crutch for the club’s grand plans with Ker saying they have “warmly embraced the team and the town”. Further investment and equity from others if needed in time is not being ruled out, but only from those â like the Allyns â who will be emotionally, as well as financially, invested. Such money will be needed as the turbo-charged rise means Wrexham have their work cut out to catch up with the growth of the club. Investment has been pushed towards improving the off-the-field workings of a club run by supporters less than five years ago, boosting staff and expertise on the business and commercial side of things. Key infrastructure projects have been addressed, with a new training ground much-needed; the club currently utilise the Football Association of Wales’ Colliers Park venue, but accept it is not sustainable. There is a real awareness too of the necessity to improve the academy to speed up a production of home grown players to supplement signings and make more of the ‘Wrexham-mania’ among youngsters in a catchment area that has traditionally been a hotbed of talent - think Ian Rush, Mark Hughes and Neville Southall, and more recently, Harry Wilson and Neco Williams. Wrexham unveiled plans for a 5,500-capacity new Kop Stand in February 2025 All that will take a little time to come to fruition, but supporters will soon be able to witness the first steps of the priority project at Wrexham. Wrexham’s attendances will be the lowest in the Championship next season, with the Stok Cae Ras’ capacity reduced to below 10,000 as work begins on a new Kop. Removal of the temporary stand is due to begin imminently with a new 5,500-seater end due to be completed in time for the start of the 2026-27 season. Designed by Populous - the same firm behind Wembley, the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and even Las Vegas’ Sphere - it will open the door for greater revenue from surrounding amenities. There is scope to add a further 2,000 seats, but also open up the possibility for redeveloping other sides of the grounds to match and ticking all the boxes of a Premier League venue in the same way Bournemouth have done. And with international demand for tickets genuine - with tourists even attending on non-matchdays to get a glimpse of the club made famous by its high-profile documentary - the club are keen to be in a position to accommodate a growing fanbase. Work has begun on the playing surface too - a new seven figure investment into a hybrid pitch with undersoil heating to meet elite level standards and possible international fixtures. Wrexham lost just two of their 23 home league games during the 2024-25 season It is all new ground for the club. In March 2020, they were being held at home by Eastleigh to stay within two points of the National League relegation places. Covid hit, the season was suspended, and McElhenney was told by Ker to watch Sunderland Till I Die. The rest is football history, with Wrexham preparing to compete against as many as 21 teams who have previously played in the Premier League, including two former champions. But there have been examples of teams jumping from League One to the Premier League: Watford (1999), Manchester City (2000), Norwich City (2011), Southampton (2012) and Ipswich Town (2024) all achieving the feat. “There’s no reason why they won’t have another go,” says Horne. No-one at Wrexham on Saturday night would be tempted into saying a fourth in a row could happen, but no-one is ruling it out either. As Ker says: “Our greatest success has been taking one step at a time and saying ‘Right, what’s next?’” The football world is eager to find out. "

    "body": "2025/04/28 - Here’s what you need to know: This video can not be played Wrexham set for ‘huge’ Championship challenge For those wondering what next for Wrexham, the message from one half of the Hollywood ownership is unequivocal. “Not. Done. Yet. ” Rob McElhenney had been asked to sum up events at the Stok Cae Ras on Saturday as the north Wales club celebrated reaching the second tier of English football for only the second time in their history. It is quite the statement, given the rapid rise under McElhenney and Ryan Reynolds has already seen Wrexham go from the lower end of the non-league fifth tier to one step away from the Premier League. But the story appears far from over given the plans for the next steps, some taking place within hours of Phil Parkinson’s side sealing an unprecedented third successive promotion. “Four years ago, this man [McElhenney] said our goal is to make it to the Premier League,” Reynolds told Sky Sports after the win over Charlton Athletic. “And there was understandably a lot of titters, laughter and giggles - but it’s starting to feel like a tangible thing that could actually come to fruition. ” The success so far has long shown the A-list backed ambition is no joke. But as they prepare to head to the Championship, do Wrexham have what it takes to compete with new rivals such as Leicester City, Southampton and West Bromwich Albion? And can Wrexham really go up another level and make it to the Premier League?

    "title": "Latest: Eight hundred Houthi targets hit after weeks of strikes, says US",
    "body": "2025/04/28 - Let’s dive into the details: The US military says it has hit more than 800 targets since launching sustained air and naval strikes against the Houthi movement in Yemen on 15 March. In a statement on Sunday summarising recent operations, US Central Command said it had “killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous Houthi leaders”. Washington has said it is acting to end the threat the Iran-backed Houthis pose to shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. In Yemen, the Houthis - who control large swathes of the country - said the latest US attack on the capital Sanaa on Sunday killed at least eight people, including women and children. Earlier this month, the Houthi-run health ministry said US air strikes on a Red Sea coast controlled by the Houthis killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others. Last month, Trump ordered large-scale strikes on areas controlled by the Houthis and threatened that they would be “completely annihilated”. He has also warned Iran not to arm the group - something it has repeatedly denied doing. On Sunday, the US military said weapons storage and manufacturing facilities had been among targets it had struck, but said it would not “reveal specifics” about ongoing operations. The US said it “would continue to ratchet up the pressure” until Houthi attacks on vessels are halted. Since November 2023, the Houthis have targeted dozens of merchant vessels with missiles, drones and small boat attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. They have sunk two vessels, seized a third, and killed four crew members. The Houthis have said they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and have claimed - often falsely - that they are targeting ships only linked to Israel, the US or the UK. The Houthis were not deterred by the deployment of Western warships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to protect merchant vessels last year, or by multiple rounds of US strikes on military targets ordered by former President Joe Biden. After taking office in January, Trump redesignated the Houthis as a “Foreign Terrorist Organisation” - a status the Biden administration had removed due to what it said was the need to mitigate the country’s humanitarian crisis. Over the last decade, Yemen has been devastated by a civil war, which escalated when the Houthis seized control of the country’s north-west from the internationally-recognised government, and a Saudi-led coalition supported by the US intervened in an effort to restore its rule. The fighting has reportedly left more than 150,000 people dead and triggered a humanitarian disaster, with 4. 8 million people displaced and 19. 5 million - half of the population - in need of some form of aid.

    "title": "Big News: N Korea confirms it sent troops to fight for Russia in Ukraine war",
    "body": "2025/04/28 - According to new developments, North Korea has for the first time confirmed that it sent troops to fight for Russia against Ukraine. In a report on state news agency KCNA, Pyongyang’s military claimed its soldiers helped Russian forces “completely liberate” the Kursk border region, according to an order given by leader Kim Jong Un. Pyongyang’s announcement comes just days after Russian Chief of Staff Valery Gerasimov praised the “heroism” of North Korean troops, the first time Moscow has publicly acknowledged their involvement. Western officials had earlier told the BBC they believed at least 1,000 of the 11,000 troops sent from North Korea had been killed over three months. Gerasimov also claims Moscow regained full control of the country’s western Kursk region - a claim denied by Ukraine. Responding to the statement, the US said North Korea must now bear responsibility for perpetuating the war. South Korean and Western intelligence have long reported that Pyongyang dispatched thousands of troops to Kursk last year. The decision to deploy troops was in accordance with a mutual defense treaty between Pyongyang and Moscow, KCNA said. “They who fought for justice are all heroes and representatives of the honour of the motherland,” Kim said according to KCNA. North Korea and Russia demonstrated their “alliance and brotherhood” in Kursk, adding that a “friendship proven by blood” will greatly contribute to expanding the relationship “in every way”. It added that North Korea would support the Russian army again. KCNA did not say what would happen to the North Korean troops after their mission in Kursk ended and whether they would be able to return home. Reports that North Korean soldiers had been deployed to fight for Russia first emerged in October, following the deepening of bilateral ties between Kim and Putin. This included the signing of an accord where both Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Kim agreed to support each other if either country was dealing with “aggression”. Military experts have said that the North Korean troops, reportedly from an “elite” unit called the Storm Corps, are unprepared for the realities of modern warfare. “These are barely trained troops led by Russian officers who they don’t understand,” former British Army tank commander, Col Hamish de Bretton-Gordon had said earlier this year. Despite this, Ukraine’s top military commander Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi had earlier also warned that North Korean soldiers were posing a significant problem for Ukrainian fighters on the front line. “They are numerous. An additional 11,000-12,000 highly motivated and well-prepared soldiers who are conducting offensive actions. They operate based on Soviet tactics. They rely on their numbers,” the general told Ukraine’s TSN Tyzhden news programme. "

    "title": "New: 'They aimed to kill' - BBC identifies security forces who shot Kenya anti-tax protesters",
    "body": "2025/04/28 - It has been recently reported that The members of Kenya’s security forces who shot dead anti-tax protesters at the country’s parliament last June have been identified by the BBC. The BBC’s analysis of more than 5,000 images also shows that those killed there were unarmed and not posing a threat. The East African nation’s constitution guarantees the right to peaceful protest, and the deaths caused a public outcry. Despite a parliamentary committee ordering Kenya’s Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) to investigate the deaths on the streets of the capital, Nairobi - and make public its findings - no report regarding the killings at parliament has yet been issued and no-one has been held to account. The BBC World Service team analysed videos and photos taken by protesters and journalists on the day. We determined when each was taken using camera metadata, livestream timings and public clocks visible in the shots. We plotted three of the killings on a 3D reconstruction of Kenya’s parliament, allowing us to trace the fatal shots back to the rifles of a police officer and a soldier. What follows is BBC Africa Eye’s detailed timeline of events as Kenya’s MPs entered parliament for the final vote on the government’s controversial finance bill, while protesters amassed on the streets outside on Tuesday 25 June 2024. Warning: This story contains images of dead bodies Young people, labelled Gen Z protesters who had mobilised themselves on social media, began streaming into central Nairobi early in the morning - in what would be the capital’s third large-scale protest since the finance bill was introduced on 9 May. “It was a beautiful party,” says prominent human rights activist Boniface Mwangi, who was there. “Kids came out with Bluetooth speakers and their water. It was a carnival. ” Protests earlier in the week had already led lawmakers to axe tax increases on bread, cooking oil, mobile money and motor vehicles, as well as an eco levy that would have raised the cost of goods like nappies and sanitary towels. But other measures to raise the $2. 7bn (£2bn) the government said it needed to cut its reliance on external borrowing, such as higher import taxes and another on specialised hospitals, remained. “For the first time it was the Kenyan people - the working class and the middle class and the lower class - against the ruling class,” says Mwangi. The protesters had one target - parliament, where the final vote was taking place. By 09:30 local time, the last of the MPs filed into the lower house. Outside, thousands pushed towards Parliament Road from the east, north and west of the city. “For me, it was just a normal day,” says 26-year-old student journalist Ademba Allans. People were livestreaming on their TikTok and Instagram accounts, while events were broadcast live on national TV, he adds. At first, protesters were held back at roadblocks by tear gas and truncheons, then police started using water cannons and rubber bullets. By 13:00, more than 100,000 people were on the streets. “The numbers start getting bigger and people actually start getting arrested,” says Allans. “The police are everywhere. They’re trying to push people back. People are even climbing on top of those water cannons. ” Despite the growing chaos outside, MPs remained in the chamber and the voting began. By 14:00, protesters had pushed police all the way back to the north-eastern corner of parliament. Inside at 14:14, the Finance Bill 2024 was voted in: 195 in favour, 106 against. Opposition MPs stormed out and word instantly reached the masses outside. “This is when everybody is saying: ‘Whatever happens, we are going to enter the parliament and show the MPs that we believe in what we’re fighting for,’” says Allans. At 14:20, protesters finally broke through the police blockade and reached the road running alongside parliament. An abandoned police truck stationed outside the gates was set on fire. Fences were torn down and protesters set foot on parliamentary grounds. The incursion was short-lived. Parliamentary security forces quickly cleared them out. At the same time, police officers went back up Parliament Road in force to drive the protesters back. While this was happening, journalists were filming, producing minute-by-minute footage from many angles. One of those videos captured a plain-clothes police officer shouting “uaa!”, the Swahili word for “kill”. Seconds later, a police officer knelt, gunshots were heard and protesters in the crowd collapsed - seven in total. David Chege, a 39-year-old software engineer and Sunday-school teacher, and Ericsson Mutisya, a 25-year-old butcher, were shot dead. Five other men were wounded, one of whom was left paralysed from the waist down. Footage shows Allans, the student journalist, holding up a Kenyan flag as he tried to reach Chege and another casualty bleeding out after the gunfire. But who fired those shots? In the video of the officer shouting, “uaa!”, the shooter’s back was to the camera. But the BBC compared his body armour, riot shield and headgear with that of every police officer at the scene. In his case, he had an upturned neck guard. We matched his distinctive uniform to an officer in a video recorded seconds later. There, he made sure to hide his face before firing into the crowd. We do not know his name. Even after the fatal shots, the plain-clothes officer could still be heard urging his colleagues forward to “kill”. He was not so cautious about concealing his identity: his name is John Kaboi. Multiple sources have told the BBC he is based at the Central Nairobi Police Station. The BBC put its allegations to Kenya’s police service, which said the force could not investigate itself, adding that the IPOA was responsible for investigating alleged misconduct. Kaboi has been approached for comment and not replied. No-one has been held accountable for the deaths of Chege or Mutisya. The BBC found that neither of them was armed. But these would not be the only lives lost. Rather than spook the demonstrators, the killings galvanised them and they tried for parliament again. At 14:57 they made it in. Footage shows them breaking down the fences and walking across the parliament’s grounds. Many had their hands up. Others were holding placards or the Kenyan flag. Warning shots were fired. The demonstrators ducked down, then continued towards the building, filming on their phones as they went. Once inside, momentum turned to mayhem. Doors were kicked in, part of the complex was set alight and the last of the MPs fled the building. The destruction was severe but, after five minutes, footage showed them leaving the same way they had come in. At 15:04, shots rang out again and protesters tumbled across the flattened fence. As the smoke cleared, camera footage showed three bodies lying on the ground. Two were wounded - one raised his hand but could not get up. The third, 27-year-old finance student Eric Shieni, was dead - shot in the head from behind as he was leaving the grounds. The BBC again found, as in the cases of Chege and Mutisya, that he had been unarmed. BBC Africa Eye analysed more than 150 images taken during the minutes before and after Shieni was shot. We are able to identify the soldier who fired at the back of his head from 25m (82ft) away - again, we do not know his name. “The video is very clear,” says Faith Odhiambo, president of the Law Society of Kenya. “The aim was to kill those protesters. They could have had him arrested. But the fact that you shoot his head - it was clearly an intention to kill. “You have become the judge, the jury and the sentence executioner for Eric. ” The Kenyan Defence Forces (KDF) told the BBC the IPOA had not forwarded any request to look into any of its personnel involved in the operations at parliament. It added: “The KDF remains fully committed to upholding the rule of law and continues to operate strictly within its constitutional mandate. ” After the shooting Allans is seen again, leading the evacuation. Footage shows him carrying a man with blood gushing from his leg. “I feared for my life, that my parents would never see me again,” he says. “But I also feared to let other people die when I could help. ” If you’re in the UK, you can watch the full investigation on iPlayer Or if you’re outside the UK you can watch it on YouTube. As the sun set on 25 June, the country was reeling. After a week of protests, the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights declared that 39 people had died and 361 had been injured around the country. That evening President William Ruto thanked his security officers for their “defence of the nation’s sovereignty” against “organised criminals” who had “hijacked” the protests. The following day, the finance bill was dropped. “Listening keenly to the people of Kenya, who have said loudly that they want nothing to do with this Finance Bill 2024, I concede,” the president said in a national televised address, adding he would not sign it into law. But to this day no security officer has been held to account for the deaths and no official investigation has been published.

    "title": "Latest: Rock & Roll Hall of Fame picks Outkast but not Oasis",
    "body": "2025/04/28 - Here’s what you need to know: Innovative rap group Outkast, pop star Cyndi Lauper and 1960s pioneer Chubby Checker have all won places in the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. This year’s inductees were revealed live on American Idol, with the UK represented by hard rock band Bad Company and gravel-voiced eccentric Joe Cocker, 11 years after his death from lung cancer. However, Manchester bands Oasis and Joy Division/New Order failed to qualify from the shortlist. Performers become eligible for inclusion 25 years after the release of their first commercial recording. The nominations are voted on by more than 1,200 music historians, industry professionals and previously inducted artists. The full list of performers to be inducted this year is: Salt-N-Pepa, the first commercially successful female rap group, will also receive the musical influence award, alongside Warren Zevon - a cult singer-songwriter who was revered by Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan. The induction ceremony will take place in Los Angeles on 8 November, and will be streamed live on Disney+. “Each of these inductees created their own sound and attitude that had a profound impact on culture and helped to change the course of Rock &amp; Roll forever,” said the Hall of Fame’s chairman John Sykes. “Their music gave a voice to generations and influenced countless artists that followed in their footsteps. ” However, equal amounts of attention will be paid to the artists who didn’t make it into the hallowed hall, which encompasses all genres of popular music. Mariah Carey’s omission, in particular, will be seen as an egregious oversight. With 19 US number one singles, she is second only to The Beatles in terms of chart success. Her self-titled debut album spent 11 weeks at the top of the Billboard chart in 1990, and her Christmas classic, All I Want For Christmas Is You, is the 11th best-selling single of all time. This is the second time she has been overlooked by the Rock Hall’s voters. Asked for her thoughts on being snubbed last year, Carey said: “My thoughts are, I didn’t get in. ” A second snub will embolden critics who say the Hall of Fame has a poor record of admitting women. Lauper, who did make it through the voting process, was the only other woman on this year’s main ballot. Oasis were also passed over for a second time, having been nominated in 2024. But singer Liam Gallagher has previously criticised the institution, saying he wasn’t interested in receiving an award from “some geriatric in a cowboy hat”. Veteran jam band Phish also missed out on a place - despite winning a fan vote that counted towards this year’s ceremony. However, losing a nomination doesn’t mean an artist is disqualified from future ceremonies. Nile Rodgers and Chic famously had to sit through 11 nominations before they were finally inducted in 2017. A similar story emerges this year for Checker, whose song The Twist became a global phenomenon in 1960. The star, now 83, was ignored by the Rock Hall for years, even as contemporaries like Sam Cooke, Bill Haley, Wilson Pickett and Fats Domino were admitted. In 2001, Checker took out a full-page ad in Billboard magazine calling on the Rock Hall to recognise him for the song that, he said, became “the biggest dance of the century”. “I want my flowers while I’m alive,” he wrote. “I can’t smell them when I’m dead. ” Demanding a statue in the courtyard of the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, he added: “I will not have the music business ignore my position in the industry. ” That wish has finally been granted. This year’s other inductees include Outkast - aka André 3000 and Big Boi. Known for hits like Ms Jackson, Rosa Parks and Hey Ya!, their swampy Southern rhythms and bohemian take on hip-hop changed the sound of the genre in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Soundgarden, best known for grunge anthem Black Hole Sun, have also earned a place; as have The White Stripes - the garage rock band formed by Jack and Meg White in 1997, whose hits include Seven Nation Army, Hotel Yorba and Fell In Love With A Girl. Fans will speculate about whether Meg, who hasn’t been seen in public since 2009, will attend the induction ceremony. There are also musical excellence awards for Thom Bell, an architect of the Philadelphia Soul sound, and English pianist Nicky Hopkins, who contributed to records by The Rolling Stones, The Beatles and The Who. US guitarist Carol Kaye, whose fretwork can be heard on classic tracks like You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feeling and the theme to Mission: Impossible, receives the same honour. Finally, record executive Lenny Waronker, who helped develop acts like Madonna, REM and Prince, will receive the Ahmet Ertegun award, given to non-performers who have had a major influence on rock music.

    "title": "New: Trump 'thinks' Zelensky ready to give up Crimea to Russia",
    "body": "2025/04/28 - It has been recently reported that US President Donald Trump has said he thinks his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky is willing to give up Crimea to Russia as part of a peace deal - despite Kyiv’s previous rejections of any such proposal. Asked if he thought the Ukrainian president was ready to cede control of its southern peninsula, which was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014, Trump replied: “I think so. ” Trump also urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to “stop shooting, sit down and sign a deal” to end the fighting, suggesting this could be achieved within two weeks. He made the comments to reporters after returning from the Vatican, where he held a brief meeting with Zelensky before Pope Francis’ funeral. Trump said that meeting had “gone well” and that Crimea had been discussed “very briefly”. He also said that Zelensky now seemed “calmer”, in what could have been a reference to a very public clash between the two presidents at the White House in February. Ukraine has repeatedly rejected making any territorial concessions, stressing that issues about land should only be discussed once a ceasefire is agreed. Neither Zelensky nor Russian President Vladimir Putin have publicly responded to Trump’s latest comments. Earlier on Sunday, German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius warned Ukraine not to agree to a deal which involves sweeping territorial concessions in return for a ceasefire. He told German public broadcaster ARD that Kyiv “should not go as far as the latest proposal by the American president”, which he said would amount to a “capitulation”. The German minister said that Ukraine knew it might have to part with some territory to secure a truce. “But they will certainly not go as far - or should not go as far - as the latest proposal by the American president. “Ukraine could have got a year ago what was included in that proposal, it is akin to a capitulation. I cannot discern any added value,” Pistorius said. Trump said last week that “most of the major points [of the deal] are agreed to”. Reports suggest that Ukraine could be asked to give up large portions of land seized by Russia, including Crimea. The BBC has not seen the exact details of the latest US plan. On Friday, Reuters news agency reported that it had seen proposals from the US that included American legal acceptance of Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea and de facto recognition of Russian control of other occupied areas, including all of Luhansk in the east of the country. Reuters says it has also seen counter-proposals from Europe and Ukraine, which reportedly say the sides will only discuss what happens to occupied Ukrainian territory once a ceasefire has come into effect. The US plan also rules out Ukraine’s membership in the Nato military alliance and sees a UK-France led “coalition of the willing” providing a security guarantee once a ceasefire is in force without the involvement of the US. Meanwhile the Europeans want the US to give “robust” guarantees in the form of a cast-iron Nato-style commitment to come to Ukraine’s aid if it is attacked. The US reportedly further proposes to take control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant - currently occupied by Russia - which would then provide electricity to both Russia and Ukraine. The counter-plan makes no mention of giving Russia power. In an interview with Time magazine this week, Trump once again blamed Kyiv for starting the war, citing its ambitions of joining Nato. The US president also told Time: “Crimea will stay with Russia. ” On Sunday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio urged Russia and Ukraine to move forward to secure a peace deal. “It needs to happen soon,” Rubio told NBC. “We cannot continue to dedicate time and resources to this effort if it’s not going to come to fruition. ” The US has recently warned it would walk away from negotiations if progress was not made. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and Moscow currently controls almost 20% of Ukrainian territory. "

    "title": "Update: How Armenia is trying to build a Silicon Valley in the Caucasus",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - It has been recently reported that In Armenia tech education starts early. In a typical three-storey state school in the suburbs of Yerevan, the Armenian capital, nine-year old Slavik is demonstrating his invention - a box with three LED lights. “He has learned how to control it, and the programming language. You can see the code is written by him,” says Maria, the 21-year-old tech coach leading the class. Next to them, 14-year-old Eric and Narek are showing their smart greenhouse model that monitors temperature and controls fans automatically through a mobile app. Other children are enthusiastically showcasing their inventions: games, robots, apps and smart home projects. Eleven-year-old Arakel is holding his cardboard model of a house with a retractable clothesline. “I have made my mother’s work easy, one part of the device is set on the roof, and another is a motor,” he says. “When it rains the line goes under the roof to keep the clothes dry. ” These young inventors have been attending engineering lab classes where they learn programming, robotics, coding, 3D modelling and more. The programme started in 2014, and is called Armath, which translates into English as “root”. Today there are 650 Armath labs in schools across Armenia. The initiative was established by a business organisation called the Union of Advanced Technology Enterprises (UATE), which represents more than 200 high-tech Armenian companies. “The vision is that we want to see Armenia becoming a tech centre powerhouse that delivers utmost values to Armenia and to the world,” says Sarkis Karapetyan, the chief executive of UATE. In his spacious, open-plan office in Yerevan he says that there are now around 4,000 tech companies in Armenia. Armath is part of the UATE’s education and workforce development programme. Mr Karapetyan says the programme is the most successful public-private partnership in the country. “We raise capital expenditure from the private sector, we go to the schools and establish Armath labs, we donate the equipment,” he says. “And the government, the education ministry gives us a budget of $2m (£1. 5m) annually to pay the salaries of the coaches. ” There are now more than 600 coaches, and 17,000 active students. “The goal is to have 5,000 of the most talented kids decide to become engineers every year,” says Mr Karapetyan. Armenia is a landlocked country of 2. 7 million people, the smallest in the South Caucasus region, and its borders with neighbouring Azerbaijan and Turkey have been shut for decades due to unresolved territorial disputes. Unlike its neighbours, Armenia does not have natural resources or access to the sea. But throughout the Soviet era it had been a centre of mathematics and computer science. In 1956 the Yerevan Scientific Research Institute of Mathematical Machines was established in Armenia and by 1960 it had developed two first generation computers. Today, the country is tapping into its legacy with the ambition to transform itself into the tech powerhouse of the Caucasus. And there has been some success already. Picsart, a AI-powered photo and video editing website and app, was launched in Armenia in 2011. Today the company of the same name, which has dual headquarters in Yerevan and Miami, is valued at $1. 5bn. Krisp, which makes audio-processing software, and Service Titan, which provides business software, are other Armenian success stories. Meanwhile, an annual report says that Armenia is the best country in the Caucuses region in which to launch a company, putting it in 57th place globally. This compares with Georgia in 70th position, and Azerbaijan in 80th. A critical factor in boosting Armenia’s tech development is the nation’s global diaspora – some 75% of the world’s estimated Armenians, and people of Armenian descent, live elsewhere. This worldwide community provides important connections, especially in the US tech industry. In the US there are as many as 1. 6 million people of Armenian ancestry, centred on California. Samvel Khachikyan, is director of programs at SmartGate, a venture capital firm based in both California and Armenia that focuses on tech investments. He says that if you look at the top 500 companies in the US, “for sure you’ll find at least one or two Armenians” in the boardroom or one management level below. Mr Khachikyan explains how his company helps Armenian entrepreneurs set up operations in the US. “Imagine an Armenian start-up, two young people deciding to go to the US to try to operate there, they have no connections, no knowledge about the culture how it works. “It’s gonna be hard, very hard. We are helping them, it’s like the launch of the rocket, the first couple of seconds is the hardest. ” SmartGate takes Armenian founders to Silicon Valley and Los Angeles for intensive networking with top US companies and investors. But many Armenian start-ups first test their products in their home market. Irina Ghazaryan, is the founder of an app called Dr Yan that is changing how Armenians access healthcare by enabling them to more easily book appointments with doctors. Ms Ghazaryan was previously working in product and web design when, helped by the fact she comes from a family of doctors, she identified a gap in the market. “Patients couldn’t find the right doctors, and doctors were suffering from endless calls. ” The app operates on a subscription model, with doctors paying to be listed on the platform, and there are plans to expand. “We are growing at least 25% revenue month by month,” adds Ms Ghazaryan. “We are almost break-even in Armenia and that gives us strength to start expanding to other markets, like Uzbekistan. ” Armenia’s tech ecosystem received an unexpected boost in 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Thousands of Russian IT specialists left their country, and many chose to settle in Armenia. Meanwhile, US chipmaking giant Nvidia moved its Russian office to Armenia. Vasily is a Russian IT consultant who relocated to Armenia in 2023. “Armenia was the most friendly to people from Russia in order to help them move, adapt and so on,” he says. He estimates that that the Russian IT community in Armenia now totals 5,000 to 8,000 people. This influx has said to have filled crucial skill gaps in Armenia’s tech sector, in areas such as data processing, cybersecurity, and financial technologies. Yet Vasily says that Armenia can be expensive and the country needs to reduce the tax burden on IT firms if it wants them to stay in the country. However, overall optimism remains high about Armenia’s tech future. Samvel Khachikyan expects the sector to boom. He points to Service Titan, which floated on the New York Stock Exchange last December, and is now worth more than $10bn. "

Starting the alternate-shot final round five shots off the lead, McIlroy and Lowry shot two-under 34 on the front nine, but stumbled with bogeys at 13, 15 and 17 after play resumed following a 90-minute weather delay. With a birdie on the last, McIlroy and Lowry carded a closing even-par 72 to finish in a tie for 12th. As McIlroy, playing for the first time since winning the Masters, and Lowry faded on the back nine, a three-way battle emerged in the closing stages. Novak and Griffin, who held a three-shot lead after three rounds, finished strongly to clinch a one-shot win over Danish twins Nicolai and Rasmus Hojgaard. The overnight leaders were tied at -27 with another American pair in Jake Knapp and Frankie Capan III before a decisive two-shot swing on the par-three 17th. While Knapp and Capan III made bogey after finding water, Griffin holed a superb birdie putt from the back of the green to establish a two-stroke cushion with one hole left. The Hojgaard brothers birdied the par-five 18th to card a four-under 68, but finished one shot shy as Novak and Griffin made par for a winning 71. It was a particularly satisfying victory for Novak, who lost to Justin Thomas in a play-off at last week’s RBC Heritage. "

    "title": "New: The rapid remaking of a nation, in 100 days",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - It has been recently reported that During last year’s presidential campaign, Donald Trump constantly repeated his intention to bring about dramatic change as soon as he returned to the White House. But few expected it to come at such breakneck speed. In the three months since he took the oath of office, the 47th president has deployed his power in a way that compares to few predecessors. In stacks of bound documents signed off with a presidential pen and policy announcements made in all caps on social media, his blizzard of executive actions has reached into every corner of American life. To his supporters, the shock-and-awe approach has been a tangible demonstration of an all-action president, delivering on his promises and enacting long-awaited reforms. But his critics fear he is doing irreparable harm to the country and overstepping his powers - crippling important government functions and perhaps permanently reshaping the presidency in the process. Here are six turning points from the first 100 days. For once, it wasn’t a Trump social media post that sparked an outcry. Three weeks into the new term, at 10. 13am on a Sunday morning, Vice-President JD Vance wrote nine words that signalled a strategy which has since shaped the Trump administration’s second term. “Judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s legitimate power,” he declared on X. In the media frenzy that followed, legal experts lined up to challenge that assertion, pointing to a 220-year-old principle which lies at the heart of American democracy. Courts have the power to check and strike down any government action - laws, regulations and executive orders - they think violates the US Constitution. Vance’s words represented a brazen challenge to judicial authority and, more broadly, the system of three co-equal branches of government crafted by America’s founders. But Trump and his team remain unapologetic in extending the reach of the executive branch into the two other domains - Congress and the courts. The White House has moved aggressively to wrest control of spending from Congress, unilaterally defunding programmes and entire agencies. This erosion of its power has been largely met by silence on Capitol Hill, where Trump’s Republicans hold slim majorities in both chambers. The courts have been more resistant, with well over 100 rulings so far halting presidential actions they deem to be unconstitutional, according to a tally by the New York Times. Some of the biggest clashes have been over Trump’s immigration crackdown. In March, more than 200 Venezuelans deemed a danger to the US, were deported to El Salvador, many under sweeping wartime powers and without the usual process of evidence being presented in court. A Republican-appointed judge on a federal appeals court said he was “shocked” by how the White House had acted. “Now the branches come too close to grinding irrevocably against one another in a conflict that promises to diminish both,” Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson wrote. Trump and White House officials have said they will obey court rulings, even as the president lambasts many of the judges who issue them and the administration at times moves slowly to fully comply. It all amounts to a unique test of a constitutional system that for centuries has operated under a certain amount of good faith. While Trump has been at the centre of this push, one of his principle agents of chaos is a man who wasn’t born in the US, but who built a business empire there. Elon Musk, dressed in black from head to toe and wearing sunglasses, stood centre stage and basked in the adulation of the Conservative Political Action Conference crowd. The richest man in the world, who wants to cut trillions of dollars from the federal government, said he had a special surprise. Argentinian President Javier Milei, known for his own budget-slashing, emerged from backstage and handed him a shiny gold chainsaw. “This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy,” Musk exclaimed. “CHAINSAW!!” It was a dramatic illustration not only of Musk’s enthusiasm for his “Department of Government Efficiency” (Doge) assignment, but also of the near rock-star status that the South African-born technologist has developed among the Trump faithful. Since that appearance, Musk has dispatched his operatives across the federal government, pushing to access sensitive government databases and identify programmes to slash. Although he has not come anywhere near to finding the trillions of dollars of waste he once promised, his cuts have drastically reduced dozens of agencies and departments - essentially shutting down the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and attempting to dismantle the Department of Education. While pledges to cut “waste, fraud and abuse” in government and trim the ballooning federal deficit typically have broad appeal, the manner in which Musk has used his metaphorical chainsaw has led to conflict with senior government officials and stoked anger among some of the American public. Some Trump supporters may approve of the administration’s aggressive budget-cutting but other constituents have berated Republican legislators at town hall events. Hecklers have expressed fear that the cuts will adversely affect popular government programmes like Social Security retirement plans, veterans benefits, and health insurance coverage for the poor and elderly. Their concerns may not be entirely misplaced, given that these schemes make up the bulk of federal spending. If these programmes are not cut back, sweeping tax cuts that Trump has promised would further increase the scale of US government debt and put at risk arguably his biggest election promise - economic prosperity. When trader Richard McDonald saw Trump hold up his charts in the White House Rose Garden showing a list of countries targeted by US tariffs, he knew he had to act fast. “I jumped to my feet because I wasn’t expecting a board [of charts] - I was expecting an announcement,” he says. McDonald expected tariff cuts of 10% or 20%, but says “nobody expected these huge numbers”. He raced to understand which companies might be worst hit. Then he sold. “There are billions being wiped off share prices every second, so it’s really ‘fastest finger first’. ” He is one of the many traders who were at the coal face of global markets when share prices plunged everywhere following Trump’s so-called “Liberation Day” tariff announcement. The S&amp;P 500 index of the largest firms listed in the US was hit particularly hard - and even though the White House has reversed course on some of the highest tariffs, it hasn’t fully recovered since. The economy was the biggest concern for US voters in November’s election, and Trump rode a tide of deep unhappiness over Biden’s handling of inflation all the way to victory. His pledge to cut prices, pare back government regulation and boost homegrown industry was a pro-business message warmly welcomed on Wall Street and by many working Americans. But as Trump tries to follow through on his promise of new tariffs, the economic costs, at least in the short term, have become painfully apparent. The stock market is sinking, interest rates - including for home mortgages - are rising, and consumer confidence is down. Unemployment is also ticking up, in part due to the growing number of federal employees forced out of their jobs. The Federal Reserve Bank, along with economic experts, warn Trump’s plan will shrink economic growth and possibly lead to a recession. While the president’s approval ratings on his handling of the economy have tumbled, many of his supporters are sticking with him. And in former industrial areas hollowed out by the loss of manufacturing jobs, there are hopes that tariffs could even the global playing field. “Trump has earned back the respect,” says truck driver Ben Maurer in Pennsylvania, referring to tariffs on China. “We are still the force to be reckoned with. ” Economic concerns have contributed to Trump’s overall decline in the polls, but in one key area, he is still largely on solid ground in the public’s eye - immigration. “It’s him! It’s him! I recognise his features,” says Myrelis Casique Lopez, pointing at a photo of men shackled and cuffed on the floor of one of the most infamous prisons in the world. She had spotted her son in the image, taken from above, of a sea of shaven heads belonging to men in white T-shirts sat in long, straight rows. At home in Maracay, Venezuela, Ms Casique was shown the photograph, first shared online by the El Salvador authorities, by a BBC reporter. When she last had contact with her son, he was in the US and facing deportation to Venezuela but now he was 1,430 miles (2,300 km) away from her, one of 238 men sent by US authorities to a notorious mega-jail in El Salvador. The Trump administration says they are members of the Tren de Aragua gang - a powerful, multi-national crime operation - but Ms Casique insists her son is innocent. A tough stance on immigration was a central plank of Trump’s re-election campaign, and the president has used his broad powers of enforcement to deliver that pledge. Illegal border crossings were falling at the end of the Biden presidency, but are now at their lowest monthly total for more than four years. A majority of the US public still backs the crackdown, but it has had a chilling effect on communities of foreign students who have found themselves caught up in the blitz. Some, including permanent residents, have been detained and face deportation because of their role in pro-Palestinian campus protests. They have rejected accusations that they support Hamas. Civil rights lawyers warn that some migrants are being deported without due process, sweeping up the innocent among the “killers and thugs” that Trump says are being targeted. While so far there haven’t been the level of mass deportations that some hoped for and others feared, newly empowered immigration enforcement agents have taken action across the US in businesses, homes and churches. They have been active in universities too, which have become a prominent target of President Trump in several other ways. On 21 April, Harvard University’s president, Alan Garber, decided to confront the White House head-on. In a letter to the university community, he announced a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s move to freeze billions of dollars in federal grants. It was, he said, an illegal attempt to “impose unprecedented and improper control” over Harvard’s operations. The White House said it had to take action because Harvard had not tackled antisemitism on campus - an issue that Garber said the university was taking steps to address. But the Ivy League college’s move was the most prominent display of resistance against Trump’s use of presidential power to target American higher education, a longstanding goal energised by pro-Palestinian protests that engulfed campuses in 2024. The president and his officials have since impounded or threatened to withhold billions of dollars in federal spending to reshape elite institutions like Harvard, which the president and many of his supporters think push a liberal ideology on students and researchers. Earlier in the month, Columbia University in New York City had agreed to a number of White House demands, including changes to its protest policies, campus security practices and Middle Eastern studies department. A similar dynamic has played out in the corporate and media worlds. Trump has used the withholding of federal contracts as a way to pressure law firms to recruit and represent more conservatives. Some of the firms have responded by offering the Trump administration millions of dollars in free legal services, while two firms have filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the administration’s punishments. A defamation lawsuit Trump brought against ABC News has led to the media company contributing $15m (£11m) to Trump’s presidential foundation. CBS is also in talks to settle a separate lawsuit over a Kamala Harris interview, as its parent company Paramount seeks federal approval for a merger with Skydance Media. The Associated Press, by contrast, has resisted administration pressure to accept Trump’s “Gulf of America” name change despite the White House’s efforts to block the news agency from coverage of the president. On the campaign trail, Trump warned about the runaway power of the federal government. Now in office, he is wielding that power in a way no previous modern president has attempted. Nowhere, however, have the impacts of his efforts been more visible than within the federal government agencies and departments that he now controls. The press conference at the White House began with a moment’s silence for the victims of an aircraft collision over the Potomac River. Within seconds of the pause coming to an end, however, Trump was on the attack. A diversity and inclusion initiative at the Federal Aviation Agency was partly to blame for the tragedy, the president claimed, because it hired people with severe intellectual disabilities as air traffic controllers. He did not provide any evidence. It was a startling moment that was emblematic of the attack his presidency has launched against inclusivity programmes that have proliferated in recent years across the US government and corporate world. Trump has directed the federal government to end its diversity and equity (DEI) programmes and investigate private companies and academic institutions thought to be engaged in “illegal DEI”. His directive has accelerated moves among leading global companies like Meta and Goldman to cut back or eliminate these programmes. First introduced in the 1960s in the wake of civil rights victories, early forms of DEI were an attempt to expand opportunities for black Americans. They later expanded to take in women, LGBT rights and other racial groups. Efforts were stepped up and embraced by much of corporate America in the wake of the 2020 Black Lives Matters protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis Police officers. But to its critics, DEI was putting politics and race above talent, creating division and was no longer needed in modern America. While Trump’s directive seems to have support from a narrow majority of voters, some of the unexpected consequences have raised eyebrows. Arlington National Cemetery scrubbed from its website all mentions of the history of black and female service members. And the Enola Gay aircraft that dropped an atomic bomb on Japan was initially flagged for removal from Pentagon documents, apparently due to the word “gay”. Donald Trump’s first 100 days have been an unprecedented display of unilateral power exercised by a modern American president. His efforts to dismantle large swaths of the federal government will take years, if not decades, for subsequent presidents to restore - if they so desire. In other ways, however, Trump’s efforts so far may end up being less permanent. Without the support of new laws passed by Congress, many of his sweeping reforms could be wiped away by a future president. And so to what extent this whirlwind start leads to lasting change remains an open question. Later this year, the narrow Republican majorities in Congress will attempt to provide the legislative backing for Trump’s agenda, but their success is far from guaranteed. And in next year’s mid-term congressional elections, those majorities could be replaced by hostile Democrats bent on investigating the administration and curtailing his authority. Meanwhile, more court battles loom - and while the US Supreme Court has a conservative tilt, its decisions on a number of key cases could ultimately cut against Trump’s efforts. The first 100 days of Trump’s second term have been a dramatic show of political force, but the next 1,361 will be the real test of whether he can carve an enduring legacy.

    "title": "Update: Faisal Islam - There are signs Trump could be ready to retreat on tariffs",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - According to new developments, Over the past week I have crossed a radically changing North America, from Arizona to Washington DC in the US and then on to Saskatchewan in Canada, witnessing clear evidence of the consequences of historic change in the way the world economy is run. Huge uncertainty means nobody really knows where it is headed. The walk from the White House Rose Garden to the HQ of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) takes just 9 minutes. In the past few days, in this very short stroll, two very different worlds collided with each other. The former is the place where at the start of this month, with an extraordinary chart and questionable equation, President Trump took on the world with his so-called “reciprocal tariffs”. The latter is the place where just three weeks on from that, after rowback, market tumult, and confusion, the finance ministers of the entire world gathered to try to pick up the pieces, even as they were still rebounding off the ground. At the IMF meetings that included gatherings of G7 and G20 members, something unique happened. The US representatives faced not open hostility, but exasperation, bewilderment and deep concern, from almost the entire rest of the world, for having sent the global economy back towards a crisis, just as it had finally emerged from four years of pandemic, war and energy shocks. The concern was most acutely expressed by the East Asian countries, who had in early April been classed as “looters and pillagers” of American jobs because of the fact that these economies, many of them key allies of the US, export more goods to the US than the other way around. The talk of the G7 was the quiet determined fury of the Japanese, who were said to feel betrayed by the US turn on trade, and whose confusion over what US trade negotiators actually wanted recently sparked a sell off of US government bonds. The finance minister Katsunobu Kato told the roundtable the US tariffs were “highly disappointing”, hurting growth and destabilising markets. I was reminded of the time at the IMF in 2022 when developing country finance ministers asked me if everything was OK in Britain during the mini budget crisis of Liz Truss’ government. Then the UK was the source of fragility, trading like an emerging market, when its normal role was solving crises in those markets. In the face of febrile bond markets, this week the faint sound of the bugle of retreat on the US trade war got louder. A forest of olive branches seemed to be on offer from the US to get the Chinese to come back to the table to negotiate, from respect for their economic achievements to the offer of a deal to do a “beautiful rebalancing” of the world economy. It was a far cry from the claims of “looting and pillaging”. Yet a much hoped for meeting between US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Chinese counterpart did not materialise. Most of the rest of the world leaving their meetings with Bessent are reporting back an assumption that the US is edging away from what it cannot acknowledge was overreach. And there is a widespread view that there is no need for countries to retaliate, when the CEOs of Walmart and Target are telling the President privately that there will be empty shelves from early May. The collapse in container traffic from China to the port of Los Angeles - the main artery of the world economy for the first quarter of the 21st century - is the one to watch. The IMF’s boffins say they can start to see the impact from space as satellites track fewer, increasingly empty ships leaving China’s ports. Of course this will be denied by the US. It is true that there was far more relative calm at the end of the IMF Meetings compared to the beginning. Why? Because the US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has seized control of the tariff agenda and has almost single-handedly calmed markets and the rest of the world. Financial diplomats put down the Bessent ascendancy and the critical 90 day pause in the so-called “reciprocal” tariffs to some farcical West Wing antics. The story goes Bessent was able to get the ear of Trump regarding the bond market damage from his tariffs, only after a separate White House economic adviser managed to use the bait of a fake meeting to lure away the hardline tariff hawk and author of the infamous reciprocal tariff equation Pete Navarro from patrolling the Oval Office. Wall Street bosses are thought to have suggested that only by firing Navarro, can some semblance of normality return. Insiders suggest that Trump will never get rid of his trade adviser, as he served time in jail after the January 6 riots in support of the President. At best this sounds like the future of the world economy and all our livelihoods played out like a real time Hilary Mantel novel about the court of Trump. At worst it is leading to financiers and Governments starting to think the unthinkable about how much further the US or the rest of the world might go and currently, the uncertainty about everything is more concerning than the direct impact of the tariffs. And that uncertainty is prompting some fairly wild theories about what might come next. At times of acute global financial stress, “swap lines” between central banks exist to preserve financial stability, making sure there is a constant supply of US dollars. But now some of the world’s central banks have started to game out what might happen if the US chose to use its dollar “swap lines” to the rest of the world as a form of diplomatic leverage or even a weapon. Is it inconceivable that the US might deny them or veto the Federal Reserve handing them out? One just has to assume it is inconceivable, because in many instances there is no way to mitigate it. But the nightmarish scenario for the world financial system, however unlikely, is now not wholly implausible. A little less unlikely perhaps is the idea that those countries with a trade surplus with the US could help fund the US with an effective tax on their holdings of US government debt. Some of these ideas have been floated in speeches and papers by US government advisers. In this atmosphere, worrying but incorrect ideas can start to infect confidence. For example, there was a “whodunnit” about significant selling of US Government debt just after the original tariff reveal. Some speculated it was China. But Tokyo currently happens to be the biggest overall creditor to the US. Was this Japanese selling that helped make the case to Trump for the tariff pause, an almost deliberate diplomatic tactic? Two very well connected officials suggested this scenario to me, which shows the febrility right now, even though it seems implausible. While Bessent commanded the weekend airwaves in the US having assumed control of this process, it was still quite something to see him sending the message that “Investors need to know that the U. S. government bond market is the safest and soundest in the world”. If you have to say it… Another significant finance minister told me of his global counterparts that “no one was crawling to the Americans” given the unbeatable effectiveness of the US having to negotiate with its own bond market. Amid the uncertainty, no one seems to know if the “baseline” universal tariff of 10% is even negotiable. President Trump’s message that tariff revenue could be sufficient to “completely eliminate” income taxes for “many people” would rather suggest that it will stay. “It depends on who you talk to on which day of week… I’ve heard three different positions articulated on the baseline, one by the White House, one by the Commerce Dept, and one by a US Trade representative,” said one senior G7 official. “Do you know what the final outcome will be? Whatever the president wants at that moment, shaped by industrial, market and political issues,” I was told. This is of particular interest to the UK, because the baseline bites the UK hard. Alongside big tariffs on cars which are our biggest goods export and likely further ones on pharmaceuticals, our second most important export, the US hit to the UK appears inexplicable when by the White House’s own creative definition of “trade cheating” - running a goods surplus - the US is actually slightly “cheating” the UK. I put this point to the Chancellor several times over two interviews in Washington. She diplomatically rejected that suggestion. But eventually right at the end of our last interview, strolling around the famous reflecting pool in between the Lincoln Memorial and the National Monument, she volunteered something rather telling of the changing world. “I understand why there’s so much focus on our trading relationship with the US but actually our trading relationship with Europe is arguably even more important, because they’re our nearest neighbours and trading partners,” she told me. It caused a bit of a fuss back home, but it was not an off the cuff gaffe. That’s because concessions to the US on food standards are off limits for domestic political reasons. This appears to have been accepted by the Americans after consistent UK diplomacy, as the focus remains on a technology prosperity deal. It seems pretty clear now that the UK is going to push ahead with a “high ambition high alignment” deal with the European Union. And word had got out here among finance ministers. A very senior international official used the example of the UK-EU rapprochement as an example of the rest of the world coordinating and “doing its homework” as a response to US unreliability. “Brexit was a bitter divorce, but now I see you are dating again,” I was told privately. There was also some relief that the US remained engaged with the World Bank and IMF. The Project 2025 plan that was published in April 2023 by the think tank The Heritage Foundation in anticipation of a second Trump presidency envisaged the US leaving those international organisations, and the Governor of the Bank of England recently expressed his concerns to me. Bessent used the meetings to confirm US commitment to the Bank and the Fund, albeit with a return to their core functions and away from considerations of social issues and the environment. The Europeans counted that as a win. But a bigger canvas remains. Will the US use this trade war in order to try to corral the rest of the world on to its side in a grand battle with China? It seems astonishing to have annoyed allies so significantly and fundamentally if this was the strategic point of all this. A test case here is Spain, which faces 20% tariffs as an EU member state. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez met President Xi in Beijing a fortnight ago. Spain’s booming economy (the fastest growing advanced economy last year - and forecast to be again this year) is the only one to be upgraded by the IMF. It is built on green energy, access to foreign labour, tourism and significant investment and technology transfer from China. The US took a dim view of the visit and held a “frank” discussion with its finance minister Carlos Cuerpo. He appeared rather unmoved by all this, telling me at the Semafor World Economy Summit in DC: “There’s a huge trade deficit with China, and we need to correct that by opening up to China, by also attracting Chinese investment, of course, within an overall economic security umbrella. And that can only be done by engaging and actually talking to the Chinese authorities”. Spain has secured notable Chinese electric vehicle factory investment and technology transfer. The US doesn’t like it. But if the US wanted to persuade the Spanish and EU of its reliable long term allyship against China, it is difficult to see the strategy in the past month’s tariff accusations and chaos. Whoever wins in Canada’s election will bring that G7 economy firmly back into this globally transformative debate. Could the newly elected Canadian PM start a full fat negotiation with the UK too? And then he will chair the G7 Summit in Canada in June as President Trump’s 90 day deadline expires. It is presumed Donald Trump will travel to Alberta, to the country he claims should be part of his own. There is a path to trade peace, calm and deescalation. But it could get much worse too. This is a critical few weeks for the world economy.

    "title": "New: Urgent care in England performing 'far worse' than pre-pandemic, think tank says",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - It has been recently reported that A leading health think tank says urgent and emergency care in England is performing “far worse” than before the pandemic. The Health Foundation argues that the NHS was “in distress” this winter with A&amp;E waiting times reaching a record high. The group says it would be wrong just to blame relatively high levels of flu. The government is due to publish an urgent and emergency care plan soon. The Department for Health and Social Care said that hospitals were “feeling the strain” but that it was taking “decisive action” to prevent winter crises. The Health Foundation report on the recent winter says that the number of people waiting 12 hours or more in A&amp;E after a decision to admit to a ward was the highest since modern records began. It topped 60,000 in January, or 11% of emergency admissions. The report says that a familiar problem remains as acute as ever – delays discharging patients from hospital who are fit to leave. This, it says, made bottlenecks worse in A&amp;E and for ambulances trying to hand over patients and that delays for those handovers were worse than in previous winters. The authors acknowledge that flu cases in hospitals were higher than usual but no worse than in the winter of 2022-23 – though the number took longer to fall than in that year. Hospital patients with the winter vomiting bug norovirus were also more numerous than in many winters. But hospital admissions for the respiratory virus RSV were similar to previous winters, and Covid admissions remained relatively low. Overall emergency hospital admissions fell slightly compared to the previous winter, as did the number of people going into major A&amp;E units. The authors argue that the NHS should be prepared for winters like this one and that blaming external factors such as winter bugs risked offering “false comfort” about the state of the health service. Tim Gardner, assistant director at the Health Foundation, said an annual winter crisis did not have to be inevitable and the analysis should be a “wake up call to the government to focus on the underlying issues”. A Department for Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Despite our actions to protect patients during the colder months, including vaccinating more people than last winter, we know hospitals are feeling the strain. “Annual winter pressures should not automatically lead to an annual winter crisis. ” It says its “decisive action” included ending the junior doctors’ strikes and rolling out the country’s first RSV vaccine. The Royal College of Emergency Medicine said in response to the report there was a “clear roadmap” and that the urgent and emergency care plan and a 10-year plan for the NHS, which are both due soon, offered “an unmissable opportunity to implement changes that are so desperately needed”. In a separate move the Department of Health and Social Care said a target for increasing the number of hospitals in England allowing patients to view appointments through the NHS app had been exceeded. The target was 85% by March and the outcome was 87%, up from 68% last July, it said. The department also said because more patients could get access to correspondence via the app, 12 million fewer letters had been sent since July. There were 1. 5 million fewer missed appointments, it said. Ministers said this was helping cut waiting lists and saving taxpayers money. "

    "title": "Breaking: Burnley's Parker and Blades' Hamer win EFL awards",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - Let’s dive into the details: Gustavo Hamer has contributed to 16 goals for Sheffield United from midfield this season Burnley boss Scott Parker and Sheffield United midfielder Gustavo Hamer have been named the Championship manager and player of the year. Parker has guided the Clarets back to the Premier League, breaking multiple records along the way, including the most clean sheets (30) and fewest goals conceded (15) - while they could yet still match Reading’s 33-game unbeaten record set in 2005-06. Hamer has produced one of the best seasons of his career with nine goals and seven assists to help the Blades to a third-place finish, missing out on automatic promotion despite amassing 89 points with a game to spare. Birmingham City’s Chris Davies won the League One manager of the year award after leading the Blues to the title and an instant return to the Championship, while Wycombe’s 18-goal striker Richard Kone picked up the player and young player awards. Bradford City boss Graham Alexander and Bromley forward Michael Cheek, who has netted a division-high 23 goals in the club’s debut EFL season, scooped League Two’s manager and player of the year prizes. The 97 points Burnley have already achieved is the highest Parker has managed as a head coach, exceeding his tally when he took Fulham (81) up via the play-offs in 2019-20, and when he won automatic promotion with Bournemouth (88) in 2021-22. Scott Parker has won promotion to the Premier League three times as a manager “I am really proud of that [the points tally],” Parker told BBC Sport. “To think that we’re on target if we can go and win at the weekend, a 100-point tally is a huge achievement. “That, along with everything else that comes with it in terms of the unbeaten record now of 32 games, the clean sheets, the goals conceded. “This [promotion] is right up there because of the journey we’ve been on. This is a team that was practically put together in the last week of the transfer window and to come together like they have makes me immensely proud of them. ” Parker, 44, took over at Turf Moor at the beginning of the season and edged out Daniel Farke of title rivals Leeds United, Sheffield United’s Chris Wilder and Sunderland head coach Regis Le Bris to win the award. Burnley’s astonishing defensive record meant goalkeeper James Trafford and centre-back pair Maxime Esteve and CJ Egan-Riley were named in the Championship team of the year, which also featured Leeds full-back Jayden Bogle, midfielder Ao Tanaka and winger Dan James. Brazil-born Dutchman Hamer has been the orchestrator of a Sheffield United team that have won 28 games - more than any other side in the Championship - as he saw off Trafford and James to win the award. “I feel delighted, I’m buzzing,” Hamer, 27, said. “Except from promotion as a team, this is the best reward you can get as a player. “You can’t do it without your team, we need each other. I can’t thank my team-mates enough to get this prize. “I speak a lot with our captain Jack Robinson and he said to me last week ‘we need you more than ever at the moment’. That gives you a boost as player that the captain is giving you responsibility. “I can be really happy with how I’ve done so far but we’re not done yet. ” Sunderland midfielders Chris Rigg and Jobe Bellingham have 12 goal contributions between them this season Sunderland duo Jobe Bellingham and Chris Rigg won the young player and apprentice of the season awards for the Championship, having helped the Black Cats into the play-offs. Birmingham boss Davies has overseen a dominant season, racking up 105 points with two games still to play - a third-tier record since the introduction of three points for a win. Blues defenders Christoph Klarer and Alex Cochrane and midfielder Tomoki Iwata also made the League One team of the year. Davies beat Phil Parkinson, who has led runners-up Wrexham to three successive promotions, Charlton boss Nathan Jones and Leyton Orient’s Richie Wellens to the award. “My first season as a manager couldn’t have gone any better but for the club, I’m really pleased we bounced back into the Championship and we’ve won it in style,” Davies said. “It’s been a fantastic season, capped off by getting the points record. ” Double award winner Kone, who was playing in the ninth tier of English football only 13 months ago, said: “It’s an unbelievable achievement. I wouldn’t have thought of this a few years ago. “To be standing there with not one but two awards and in the team of the year is well is just an amazing achievement. I am really proud of myself and enjoying the moment. ” The EFL goal of the season went to Notts County’s on-loan Tottenham midfielder George Abbott for his phenomenal volley into the top corner at Accrington in League Two in January.

    "title": "Big News: Kneecap 'kill MP' footage being assessed by police",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - It has been recently reported that Footage of rap group Kneecap allegedly calling for the death of British MPs is being assessed by counter-terrorism police. A video has emerged of the west Belfast trio at a November 2023 gig appearing to show one person from the band saying: “The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP. ” The Metropolitan Police also said that another video, from November last year, is being assessed. The footage appeared to show a band member shouting “up Hamas, up Hezbollah” at a performance in London. Kneecap have said on social media that they have “faced a co-ordinated smear campaign”. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them. A Met Police spokesperson said: “We were made aware of a video on 22 April, believed to be from an event in November 2024, and it has been referred to the Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit (CTIRU) for assessment and to determine whether any further police investigation may be required. “We have also been made aware of another video believed to be from an event in November 2023. ” A UK government spokesman said: “We unequivocally condemn threatening remarks made towards any individual. “Political intimidation and abuse must have no place in our society. We recognise the chilling effect that harassment and intimidation of elected representatives can have on our democracy. “All reports of intimidation, harassment and threats are taken extremely seriously. We work with the police and Parliament to do everything in our power to crack down on threats to elected officials. ” Democratic Unionist Party leader Gavin Robinson called for Kneecap to be investigated. “Promoting sectarianism, glorifying violence and spreading division under the guise of “art” is still hate,” the Belfast East MP said in a post on X. None of the members of the group have been charged with any offences. The group has faced recent criticism after they displayed messages about the war in Gaza during their set at US music festival Coachella earlier this month. Following former X Factor judge Sharon Osbourne calling for Kneecap’s US work visas to be revoked, the band was dropped by its now-former sponsor and booking agent Independent Artist Group (IAG). The agency confirmed the split to The Hollywood Reporter. Kneecap hit back at the visa call, and when asked by BBC News NI for a response, the band replied: “Statements aren’t aggressive, murdering 20,000 children is though. ” The visas held by the band members are understood to no longer be valid and they are in the process of securing a new sponsor ahead of its sellout October tour in North America. Kneecap, made up of Liam Og Ó Hannaidh, Naoise Ó Caireallain and JJ Ó Dochartaigh, alleged on social media they have “faced a co-ordinated smear campaign”, saying their shows have previously “called out” the conflict in Gaza. They also appeared to suggest they would be taking legal action against the “malicious efforts”. Earlier in the week, Kneecap’s manager Daniel Lambert said the band had received “severe” death threats after Coachella. "

    "body": "2025/04/27 - Let’s dive into the details: This video can not be played Trump makes 100th century of the season World number one Judd Trump has pocketed a Â£100,000 bonus after he reached the 100-century mark this season during his World Snooker Championship last-16 tie with Shaun Murphy. Trump had started Sunday’s match on 98 and was the only player in contention to get to the landmark. He came agonisingly close to a century on three separate occasions as he made 98 in frame eight, 89 in frame 10 and 97 in frame 12. But successive centuries, 106 in frame 14 and 132 in frame 15, with what BBC commentator John Virgo called “a masterclass in break building”, took Trump to the feat, much to the delight of a packed Crucible crowd. He marked the achievement with a fist pump and a smile after initial relief, while he got a standing ovation from the fans with Murphy joining in the applause. Australian Neil Robertson made 103 centuries in 2013-14, while Trump is the only other person to get to 100 with his 102 in 2019-20. If Judd Trump beats Shaun Murphy in the last 16, he will play either Luca Brecel or Ding Junhui in the quarter-finals After his 10-4 win over Zhou Yuelong in the first round, Trump - then on 98 centuries - was asked what an achievement it would be to get to 100. He said: “It would be way better than the achievement last time because I played far more tournaments and far more games [in 2019-20]. “I don’t know how many games I played this season, but it would have to be a record as I’ve missed three or four tournaments. “I didn’t target it at all, I didn’t think it was a possibility. I didn’t want to be in contention but after the Championship League, I didn’t expect the pockets to be so big, and the centuries were flying in for everyone. ” Trump, the 2019 world champion, leads 10-6 over Murphy and needs three more frames to move into the quarter-finals when the match is played to a finish from 13:00 BST on Monday. The overall champion will get Â£500,000 in prize money. O’Sullivan &amp; Brecel one frame each from last eight All the updates from day nine of the World Championship World Championship: Schedule, results &amp; BBC coverage Referee Rob Spencer congratulated Judd Trump after the achievement John Parrott, the 1991 world champion, called Trump’s performance “snooker from the gods” and added: “That is some achievement. You can’t play better than this. Those two frames were of the highest order. ” Seven-time world champion Stephen Hendry agreed and added: “Judd Trump is world number one, he’s had seasons where he’s won six ranking tournaments, but I think he’s playing better than he’s ever played at the moment. “He came into the World Championship having lost a final to Kyren Wilson at the Players Championship and lost in the first round of the Tour Championship, so he came into it with not the success he’s been having. “But he was obviously able to go away for three or four weeks, put in some practice, recharge and he’s come back - he’s just getting better and it’s the best I’ve seen him playing. ” Most century breaks in one season Neil Robertson (2013-14) 103 Judd Trump (2019-20) 102 Judd Trump (2024-25) 100 Judd Trump (2020-21) 90 Neil Robertson (2018-19) 84 Judd Trump (2018-19) 83 Judd Trump (2014-15) 82 Judd Trump (2023-24) 79 Ronnie O’Sullivan (2017-18) and Kyren Wilson (2020-21) both 74 Trump’s opponent Shaun Murphy joined in with the applause Alistair: What a special player. Congrats on 100. James: Great stuff Judd Trump. 100 tons for Â£100k! Joseph: Take a bow, Judd Trump. Wonderful break building. A century of century breaks in a single season. And he makes the 100th at the Crucible. Connor: Criminal that Judd Trump has only ever won a single World Championship. A man of his quality should have three or four to his name at the very least. Exceptional player. Patrick: A century of centuries for Judd Trump in a season, a Â£100,000 bonus and to complete it at the Theatre of Dreams makes it that extra special. "

    "title": "Big News: 'Euphoria' as Arsenal reach first European final in 18 years",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - It has been recently reported that Slegers was appointed permanent Arsenal boss in January Arsenal’s exuberant and emotional celebrations at the full-time whistle in Lyon were 18 years in the making. That is how long it has been since the Gunners last contested a Champions League final and just six months ago doing so again looked like a pipe dream. But following what has often been a tumultuous campaign, with poor results and a change of manager, all is well again in North London. Arsenal produced a magnificent comeback to win 4-1 against eight-time champions Lyon in France, overturning a 2-1 first-leg deficit to reach the Champions League final where they will face holders Barcelona. It was an uncharacteristically poor performance from hosts Lyon, with an own goal in the opening five minutes setting the tone for a tough night. But Mariona Caldentey’s superb strike was followed by goals from Alessia Russo and Caitlin Foord, securing an impressive and deserved victory for the Gunners. “We were unbelievable in a high-pressure moment against a top opponent,” said boss Renee Slegers. “How calm we were - there’s so much work put into this game, I’m so happy. “Delighted for everyone. Its euphoria, such a special moment. So happy and we need to celebrate these special moments but also stay humble and we get ready for the next one. ” Some 500 Arsenal fans made the trip to Lyon for the semi-final It has been a long journey to the final for Arsenal. From round one of qualifying against Rangers back in September to now, they have played in 14 Champions League matches this season. No team has ever done so in this format. With Chelsea looking set to lift the Women’s Super League title for a sixth consecutive year, Arsenal seemed in danger of fizzling out. Instead, they have managed to do what Chelsea could not - overturn a first-leg deficit against top European opposition to reach the Champions League final. Granted, Lyon were not at their best in what boss Joe Montemurro called a “perplexing” and “inexplicable” performance. But Arsenal capitalised on that and were able to assert some dominance to win a two-legged European semi-final away from home for the first time. The outpouring of emotion at full-time from Arsenal’s veteran player Kim Little, who turns 35 in June, said it all. Alongside Spaniard Caldentey in midfield, Little dominated - controlling the game in attack and defence with her silky passes and tricky footwork. “I can’t believe she’s still playing at this level and getting better and better. It’s because of her attitude and application,” former Chelsea forward Karen Carney said on TNT Sports. “Her and Caldentey’s relationship - having the licence to go and attack, using her body, her calmness keeping the ball. “When she got emotional at the end, I’ve never seen that. She’s a classy player and person. ” Spurred on by their 500 or so travelling fans, who had been allocated a section on their own high up in the top tier of the 60,000-capacity stadium, Arsenal were clinical, scoring four goals from their six shots on target. “I think we played really well and created the momentum,” said Foord, who scored their fourth goal. “We finished our chances, which is so important. We won the ball higher up in crucial areas and I think we rattled them a bit. We got them in good areas and finished our chances. ” England duo Chloe Kelly and Alessia Russo have looked rejuvenated under Renee Slegers The last time Arsenal reached the Champions League final, Slegers was playing in the Gunners’ academy. Eighteen years later, the former midfielder will become just the second Arsenal women boss to lead out the team in the final of Europe’s top competition. The 36-year-old says she can’t remember much about the 2006-07 campaign which saw Arsenal win a historic quadruple, but recalls watching the final on television. “I remember back then there were very few role models, I couldn’t watch much on football on TV in the Netherlands. I came to England and saw them training and seeing them perform in the Champions League was very inspiring,” she said. Just seven months on from replacing Jonas Eidevall, then as interim boss, and four months on from being appointed permanently, Slegers has completely turned Arsenal’s fortunes around. In a season of change and at times turmoil, she has managed to not only steady the ship but also do what Eidevall could not: get the best out of a squad that, on paper, has long looked ready-made for success. “If you look back at the early parts of the season, Arsenal had some really difficult moments, certainly when Eidevall was in charge,” said former England midfielder Fara Williams on TNT Sports. “Slegers has given them something different. You’ve seen a real shift in the players. “They’ve been the strongest WSL team of late. They were phenomenal today. ” Russo had scored just one goal and registered one assist in the first nine games of this season but is now Arsenal’s top scorer with 19 goals in all competitions. Chloe Kelly has also proved a revelation. Struggling for minutes at Manchester City she had looked almost down and out, but a January move to the Gunners has reinvigorated her and she looks back to her best. “The manager has been a revelation,” said Carney. “I’m thrilled for them. Arsenal are back now. I really hope they win it. ” Mariona Caldentey (left) joined Arsenal last summer from Barcelona Arsenal may have twice come back from first-leg defeats to win ties against Real Madrid and now Lyon, getting their tactics right at the second time of asking, but their toughest task - against Barcelona in the final - awaits. They know they will have to get it right first time. The holders have contested five of the past six Champions League finals, winning three of them, while their two defeats came against Lyon. “It’s going to be a tough game, a final, anything can happen,” said Foord. “We look forward to it. It’s an exciting moment for us, so just can’t wait to take them on. ” A big challenge but one that could be made easier by Arsenal’s former Barca player Caldentey, who has lifted the trophy three times with her former club. The 29-year-old’s experience and know-how shone through against Lyon and she could be seen directing her team-mates throughout the match, dictating where the ball should go. She has popped up with key goals in key moments, scoring the goal that put Arsenal ahead in the tie in France, her eighth goal in her past 11 Champions League appearances for Arsenal. Carney said Caldentey is currently “the best player in the WSL” but Arsenal know they will need more than just one world-class performance to get past world-beaters Barcelona.

    "title": "Update: Myanmar's army vowed a ceasefire after the earthquake. I saw them break it repeatedly",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - Let’s dive into the details: Days after a 7. 7-magnitude earthquake shook Myanmar at the end of March, killing at least 3,700 people, the country’s ruling junta agreed to a halt in its devastating military campaign. It then violated that ceasefire, again and again. I went inside rebel-held territory in the eastern Karenni state for 10 days from mid-April. I witnessed daily violations by the junta, including rocket and mortar attacks which killed and injured civilians and resistance fighters. One of those was Khala, a 45-year-old father killed in a strike by military warplanes, in a place his wife Mala said should have been safe. When the ceasefire was announced, on 2 April, Mala and Khala sensed an opportunity to return to their home for the first time in years. With their four-year-old child, they headed from the camp where they’d taken refuge to their village, Pekin Coco. They found it abandoned, with buildings shattered from drawn-out fighting. Almost everyone there had moved to farmland further away from the junta’s weapons. But as the young family was about to leave Pekin Coco again, their car loaded with their possessions, the shelling started. “We were all at the front of the house. Then, shells landed near us. We hid at the back of the house. But he [Khala] stayed where he was,” said Mala. “The artillery shell landed and exploded near him. He died in the place where he thought he was safe. “He was a good man,” she said and began to cry. Later that afternoon, the junta’s warplanes attacked a house on the same street, killing four more men. “I hate them,” Mala said. “They always attack people without reason. I don’t feel safe here. Jet fighters are flying over the sky often but there is no place to hide. ” Mala is 31 and seven months pregnant. When we spoke she was back in a displaced people’s camp, grieving. Her son Zoe, missing his father, wouldn’t leave her side. Before the earthquake, Myanmar was in the midst of a nationwide civil war. After decades of military rule and brutal repression, ethnic groups, along with a new army of young insurgents, brought the dictatorship to crisis point. As much as two-thirds of the country has fallen to the resistance. Tens of thousands of people have been killed, including many children, since the military seized power in a coup in 2021. The UN says the earthquake has pushed a further two million people into need, some 2. 5 million were already displaced before the quake. Karenni, or Kayah, state is far from the earthquake’s epicentre. Its remoteness is both a blessing and a curse. Its thick jungle provides cover for those who oppose military rule, but it is difficult to get around, the roads are poor and main highways remain in range of the army’s guns. Most of the state is now controlled by rebel and armed ethnic groups. On 28 March when the quake hit, there were no reported deaths in Karenni - but the hospitals still filled quickly with people suffering spinal and crush injuries. A 30m (100ft) sinkhole had appeared in the forests around the town of Demoso. Locals who heard the ground open up thought it was another air strike. For many weeks, the sinkhole continued to expand with the aftershocks. The UN noted that the Myanmar military continued operations after the earthquake and beyond the ceasefire, and called for them to end. The State Administration Council, the ruling junta, has not commented on the alleged violations but has claimed that it was attacked by resistance groups. During the ceasefire all sides in the conflict have reserved the right to respond if attacked. During my 10 days in Mobeye, Karenni, I witnessed daily attacks by the junta. I met Stefano there, a 23-year-old fighting the military dictatorship with the Karenni Nationalities Defence Force (KNDF). He leads a platoon of young fighters who have set up trenches around the base. From a dugout just 100m (330ft) from the junta’s positions, he explained the army had continued attacks “using all means” during the ceasefire - soldiers on the ground, drones and jets. “They usually attack with drones and heavy artillery on this side. When it rains, they advance by taking advantage of the weather. ” He called the ceasefire a “joke”. “We did not believe the military council from the beginning. We don’t believe it now, and we won’t believe it in the future. ” The day after we spoke, the military launched a full-scale assault with heavy weapons and men, attacking rebel lines. As we made our way to the front lines, small-arms fire could be heard nearby, along with mortar strikes. The ground was pitted with fresh hits from armed drones. Nearby lay the corpse of a junta fighter who had tried to breach the rebel positions. The resistance forces say they have suspended all offensive activities during the ceasefire, but they have said they will respond if attacked. Yi Shui, the commander of another resistance group, the Karenni National Army, showed me pictures on his phone. “When we saw them, we shot them. One of them got hit” and another ran away, he said. And again, the military wasn’t just targeting the resistance forces. Its rockets hit farmland beyond, killing a 60-year-old woman. We arrived at fields where four rockets had landed, children were playing with the bent metal and shrapnel from the strikes. The injured were taken to local hospitals, which are hidden deep in the jungle to avoid air strikes from junta warplanes. In one, a young fighter was being treated in a wooden ward with a dirt floor. He had a shrapnel wound to his shoulder and was losing a lot of blood. The doctor in charge, 32-year-old Thi Ha Tun, said he’d treated around a dozen patients for war-related injuries since the ceasefire was declared. Two of the patients, resistance fighters, died. He dismissed what he called the junta’s lies. “They only care about their own interests,” he said. “They will only care about their own organisation. They will not care about the rest of this country, their own generation, the youth, the children, the elderly, anything. ” The only solution is to keep fighting, he said. High on a hilltop in the rebel-controlled areas is the church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The earthquake brought down the church steeple and part of the roof. The bell from Rome now sits in a temporary cradle. Repairs have been made, but the church will probably need to be rebuilt. They are still feeling the aftershocks here weeks later. But for Father Philip, the local priest, the greatest threat to his congregation, many of whom are the war displaced, comes from above, not below. “No place is safe. When we have jet fighters flying in the sky… you never know what will come falling from the sky. ” Back at the Mobeye front, Stefano and his men pass the hours between attacks, cleaning their weapons and singing songs. “I can hear the people’s prayers, cries, and cries. We will overthrow the dictatorship,” they sing in unison. They say the only ceasefire they will trust will come with the junta’s defeat. The truce will finish at the end of the month, but for most of the people here, it’s as if it never existed at all. "

    "title": "New: Villa object to Spurs request for fixture change",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - Experts revealed that Aston Villa are chasing a Champions League qualification spot in the Premier League Aston Villa have objected to Tottenham Hotspur’s request to move their Premier League game in May to aid the London club’s chances of possible success in Europe. Spurs are in the Europa League semi-finals and, should they reach the showpiece, they will be required to play in Bilbao on 21 May - just three days after their Villa Park meeting. In a statement released on Sunday, the club said: “We should like to inform supporters that we are in discussions with the Premier League regarding a change in date to our away Premier League match against Aston Villa, currently scheduled for Sunday, 18 May. ” BBC Sport understands Spurs wanted to bring the game forward to Thursday, 15 May, however, the request has been rebuffed by Villa. Sources close to the matter have indicated there is no precedent set for the Premier League to move fixtures to help clubs in European competition. It has been pointed out to BBC Sport that Villa have played every three to four days during April due to their participation in the Champions League and FA Cup. Another reason for the refusal is the game against Tottenham, Villa’s final home game of the season, will include a number of pre-organised family activation activities which would not be possible to complete if the match was held in the evening. Tottenham face Norwegian side Bodo/Glimt in their semi-final, with the first leg on Thursday at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, while Manchester United visit Athletic Club in the other last-four tie.

    "body": "2025/04/27 - It has been recently reported that Liverpool’s players celebrate clinching the Premier League title Liverpool’s long wait ended as the giant red and white clock in the corner of the Kop flicked over to 18:24 BST on the day that was Anfield’s destiny. The small detail was Tottenham Hotspur had been swept aside. The big picture was Liverpool were now officially Premier League champions and, with great significance, had equalled Manchester United’s total of 20 titles.

Jurgen Klopp led them to the Premier League title in 2020, but the celebrations were played out in the genteel surroundings of Formby Golf Club, and the trophy lift in front of invited family and friends at a deserted Anfield amid the Covid-19 pandemic. This explained the release of emotion at the final whistle, which had been building up hours before kick-off. It was finally unleashed in a wall of sound - fireworks exploded behind the Kop, another fog of red smoke swept around Anfield accompanied by an outpouring of tears from players and fans alike. At the heart of it all was head coach Arne Slot, the modest Dutchman who has made the so-called impossible task of succeeding Jurgen Klopp look so easy. It had been 343 days since Klopp said his Anfield farewell, attempting to ease the air of uncertainty about his departure swirling around Liverpool by singing a song in honour of his soon-to-be-anointed successor. The tune echoed around Anfield throughout this 5-1 win, and Slot delivered his own version in tribute to Klopp as ecstasy unfolded around him. “To replace Jurgen is a big job and the manager did it in his own way and deserves a lot of credit,” said captain Virgil van Dijk. “I don’t think anyone from the outside world thought we would be Premier League champions. ” Slot thanks Klopp moments after Liverpool win title 20 of the best photos from Liverpool’s momentous day ‘No-one expected this’ - how Slot guided Liverpool to the title Hours before the storm started there was little calm around Anfield.

Liverpool owner John W. Henry made one of his rare Anfield visits for the coronation, while tickets were reportedly selling at Â£3,000 on the black market. Neil Atkinson from the Anfield Wrap told BBC Radio 5 Live he felt like he was on his way to his wedding. Abigail Rudkin, also from the Anfield Wrap, likened the excitement to Christmas morning. “Just to get to be with everyone, for all of us to get to be here and sit together, it does make the difference,” she said. “You can say to yourself ‘just win it’, but for us fans all of us being together, for the players to be there with us, to be at Anfield - that’s what it’s all about. ” This video can not be played Gravenberch best midfielder in the Premier League this season - Murphy In reality, this win against a submissive Spurs was simply a step on the road from Anfield’s anticipation to the glorious realisation that the prize was theirs.

The future, for now, can wait. Slot, the architect of this triumph, told BBC Radio 5 Live: “Looking back I have enjoyed the whole day. You could see looking in their eyes how much it meant to them.

    "title": "New: Who has made Troy's Premier League team of the week?",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - According to new developments, After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the Week. Here are this week’s choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page. Robert Sanchez (Chelsea): He’s been pretty poor all season and the general consensus is that Chelsea are going to have to change their goalkeeper, but he was very good against Everton. He made three or four decent saves and then was in a position where he could command his box much better than he has done for most of the season. Kieran Trippier (Newcastle): He was excellent, assured, calm and quality on the ball. At the ripe old age of 34, he is still showing that it’s necessary to have experience in the side. He helped Newcastle to manage the game when they went 2-0 up. He showed quality for two of the goals - standing a cross up for Dan Burn and also his corner for Newcastle’s third was magnificent. Carlos Baleba (Brighton): Brighton will do well to keep hold of Baleba. There are so many levels to go up in his armoury - he is just frightening. He’s tall and powerful and his celebration after his last-minute winner wasn’t too bad either. Dan Burn (Newcastle): Burn is the magic man of Newcastle, he just keeps on going. Every time you think his story is doing to drop off, he just keeps getting better. Burn had a real ding-dong with Liam Delap but had the Ipswich forward in his back pocket and then also scored a goal. Rayan Ait-Nouri (Wolves): It looks to me like he is playing for a move, he looks focused and has the right mindset. His assist for the goal was fantastic but he just continually gets up and down the field. There are only a couple of games left and he still has that burning desire to have an impact. Alexis Mac Allister (Liverpool): He has been Liverpool’s most consistent midfielder this season. It was a great finish from him, he just looked so calm. The best bit wasn’t the goal but it was that he was the standard-setter throughout. Yasin Ayari (Brighton): He was good and solid but it’s all about his goal. What a hit and what a show of technical ability to use Lucas Paqueta who was running at him and just bend it round him. Matheus Cunha (Wolves): I’m running out of ways to praise him. He is just at home at Wolves - we know he is leaving but he just looks so comfortable in that side. Wolves know the offer is coming and he just wants to sign off on a positive. He is known as a bit of a maverick and has a wild side but at the moment he has his head screwed on. Mohamed Salah (Liverpool): He just continues to score goals and had a very decent celebration - a selfie in front the Kop. It’s at a time when you think he isn’t playing at his full potential too and on a weekend when Liverpool secure the title. Antoine Semenyo (Bournemouth): I’m so impressesed every time I watch him. I played against him at Bristol City and didn’t think he would be able to go on and do what he’s doing in the Premier League, but he is going from strength to strength. Manchester United need to be looking at him - he is powerful and drives, that’s what they need. Alexander Isak (Newcastle): He could have scored four on the day. His movement and link-up play is excellent. This guy is the complete striker in world football. Arne Slot (Liverpool): Could it be anyone else on the weekend that he delivers Liverpool a 20th league title? He has come in and only bought Federico Chiesa and turned Liverpool into a title winning team. He’s excellent as a manager, excellent in every interview and handles any adversity in the right kind of way. Do you agree with Troy’s selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

    "title": "Update: Winless and woeful - Wales' wooden spoon campaign",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - Experts revealed that Sunday’s scenes in Parma were a stark contrast to the celebrations of 2023 Controversial TikTok dances, record-breaking crowds, traffic chaos and fixture disruption surrounding Pope Francis’ funeral â Wales’ Six Nations campaign was very eventful off the pitch. On it, well that was a different story as Wales once again ended their campaign in floods of tears and disappointment. Sunday’s loss to Italy saw them finish bottom of the table with the wooden spoon for the second year running. It was also the first time in the championship that Wales suffered five straight defeats - not the sort of records they want to be breaking in their third year of professionalism. Wales had gone into the tournament with renewed optimism, the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) had a new head of women’s rugby in Belinda Moore, there was no bitter contract dispute hanging over anyone’s heads and players had been giving standout performances in the Premiership Women’s Rugby (PWR). Most significantly the Union had landed three-time PWR winner Sean Lynn as their new head coach, they even had their first ever defence coach with the temporary appointment of Dan Murphy. It seemed everything was in place for Wales to succeed, they were ready to relive the highs of 2023 and cement their status as the ‘best of the rest’. But what followed were dismal performances, some of which Lynn himself described as “unacceptable”. Wales simply didn’t show up, there were plenty of workhorses, but no weapons. And anyone who thought family-oriented Lynn was a soft touch would be proven wrong as he fired a warning shot over selection. He will be taking a look at pathway players before the tour of Australia and this summer’s Rugby World Cup in England. “We will be looking to change, we will be working hard in that pre-season,” Lynn said. “The work-rate from everyone, how much extras we’re doing because at the moment we’re not skilful enough at international level. ” Lynn warns Wales to respond or face World Cup axe WRU to revamp nation’s top women’s teams This video can not be played Scotland triumph in another thriller against Wales Wales opened their tournament steadily enough, there were plenty of green shoots of promise not to be too disappointed in the 24-21 loss against Scotland, especially when considering Lynn only had three training sessions before players took to the pitch in Edinburgh. The encouraging signs were the backline getting on the ball, something we rarely saw under Ioan Cunningham’s reign when Wales were all about the power of the forwards. But Wales’ defence looked poor with 35 missed tackles. It wasn’t Georgia Evans finest moment either after receiving two yellow cards, but she would redeem herself as the tournament progressed, proving a powerhouse at number eight and ending as one of the top tacklers and carriers. Grand Slam champions England followed as the Red Roses helped to draw a record crowd of over 21,186 at Principality Stadium. Wales took an early lead and for 10 minutes we wondered if Wales could mark the 10-year anniversary of their last win over England with a repeat. However, England proved way too strong as they ran in 11 tries in a 67-12 victory, with Wales narrowly spared a record loss. Missed tackles were again a major concern, with another 30 to add to the tally. Despite the scoreline, most Welsh players celebrated the occasion, including Jasmine Joyce-Butchers who came in for some social media stick when she joined England’s Sarah Bern in a live post-match TikTok dance. Some questioned her professionalism after such a humbling defeat while others said the women’s game punches different and it’s important to have personalities. This video can not be played ‘Chicken, Banana’ - Bern gets pundits dancing The tournament then had a fallow week, with Lynn gifted the luxury of time to prepare for another giant of the game in France. But time became the enemy when it came to travelling out for the game in Brive. Despite a lunchtime Saturday kick-off, the team didn’t fly out until Friday. They left Bristol airport in the morning before taking a coach from Bordeaux to Brive, but a road accident and rush-hour traffic meant they did not reach their hotel until late at night. The delay saw Wales miss their stadium team run-through, with the players having 13 hours of travel in their legs. It didn’t show in the first-half performance as Wales were heroic in defence and bagged a couple of tries for their efforts, but French scores either side of the half-time whistle proved decisive. Still, Wales didn’t leave France too disappointed, with the 42-12 scoreline not necessarily a reflection of their display. While England and France were almost free passes, Ireland was a game that Wales had targeted. It was an outing at Rodney Parade, which captain Hannah Jones reflected “wasn’t really home” and would prefer Cardiff Arms Park to be their permanent base. Despite taking an early lead through Carys Cox â one of a few bright sparks in this campaign â Wales were outclassed in every area of the pitch. A usually reliable set-piece crumbled as they conceded 18 penalties and fell off another 28 tackles. It prompted some tough love from Lynn in the review as he called on players to take a look at themselves heading into Sunday’s finale. This video can not be played Italy run riot in the second-half to thrash Wales Wales had an extra day to prepare for Italy due to Pope Francis’ funeral being held on the Saturday, but it made little difference. After a tight first half, it was alarming to see how easily they fell away as the Italians ran riot in a record 44-12 win over Wales. The 2023 celebrations in Parma seem a long-distance memory, while Lynn looked crestfallen after his first campaign in Test rugby. The post-match criticism didn’t end with Lynn as former players also didn’t hold back. Former number eight Sioned Harries said it was “extremely disappointing”. “I’m frustrated watching them, I can’t imagine how frustrated they (the players) are feeling,” she said. “I think individuals must look at themselves. Sean Lynn will have to have difficult and honest conversations. “I ask the question, are some of the players good enough to be professional? These discussions must happen. â Meanwhile former fly-half Elinor Snowsill said fans must show patience. “Sean Lynn doesn’t have a magic wand, he couldn’t turn things around in one campaign,” she said. “This has given him the ammunition to make changes, but this is a long-term development plan. “We just do not have enough depth, there is not enough competition for places. “The second half was really tough to watch. It’s a stark contrast to where Wales were two years ago. ” And former captain Siwan Lillicrap said the Italy loss was a “dark day for Welsh rugby”. “Five consecutive losses in this Six Nations campaign. It’s not the place this squad wants to be,” she said. “There are some tough days ahead and a lot of work to do ahead of the World Cup. ” Sean Lynn Wales’ players and staff will have some time off before reporting back for pre-season in the first week of June. They will then head down under to take on Australia in Brisbane on 26 July and again in Sydney a week later as part of their World Cup preparations. Their tournament opener is once again against Scotland, on 23 August, so Wales have less than four months to transfer themselves from a wooden spoon side to World Cup hopefuls. It’s a tough ask, but Lynn is a man who doesn’t like losing. “I coached the university men [at Gloucester-Hartpury] and it was the third season where we went seven losses on the bounce, but we turned it around and came back and won the championship,” he said. “I have been there and in these adverse moments it’s all about everyone pulling together. “It hurts, it’s hurts me massively, it hurts the players and the staff, but together we will put this right. ” "

Rico Lewis and Josko Gvardiol were on target as City beat Nottingham Forest to book a date with Crystal Palace on Saturday, 17 May. It will be their third straight FA Cup final and the chance of an eighth success in the competition, while Palace have never won a major trophy. The competition is also City’s only chance of major silverware this season, apart from the Community Shield, as their run of four straight Premier League titles ended with Liverpool officially crowned champions on Sunday. With his side fourth in the table, 21 points adrift of Arne Slot’s side, Guardiola warned an FA Cup triumph, and reaching next season’s Champions League with a top-five finish, will not be enough to mask a disappointing campaign. “No,” he said. “The damage would be minimum. It’s not going to confuse [that] the season has been good. The club has to take the decision, the right ones, so next season will be better. “We are a thousand million points behind Liverpool. I said many times the season hasn’t been good because we define if the season is good or not with the Premier League. “This season it could not happen, at the same time we tried to avoid the damage. We have to be calm now and recover. ” Lewis’ second-minute goal put City in control, with the England international impressing in midfield, having been pushed up from his regular full-back role. The 20-year-old believes his side are now moving in the right direction after their faltering mid-season form proved costly in domestic and European competitions. “We can go on about excuses but it wasn’t good enough at the start of the season and now we’re picking ourselves back up and we’ve got momentum,” said Lewis. “We’ve got the chance of a trophy now and hopefully be in the top four to take into next season. “We showed character, this season we showed character. It’s not been smooth sailing but we have picked ourselves up and shown we are a top team. “We have top players and we can get through tough situations. Now we are on the up we can take it into next season. ” This video can not be played Qualifying for the Champions League is the most important thing - Guardiola After starting the season with a 13-game unbeaten run, City won just once in their next 13 in all competitions. They had slipped to seventh place on Boxing Day after a 1-1 draw with Everton, but have managed to climb back into Champions League contention. Guardiola’s side also suffered their earliest exit from the Champions League for 12 years after losing to Real Madrid in the knockout play-offs in February. They continued to stutter, thrashed 5-1 at Arsenal in February while Forest beat them 1-0 at the City Ground in March. But City have won six of their last seven games, including their last-gasp 2-1 success over top-five rivals Aston Villa on Tuesday. Midfielder Mateo Kovacic added: “We found ourselves again. The team is getting stronger, everyone is 100% focused. A lot of players came back very strong. “When we are all back we are a strong team. This season has not been how we wanted, but we are in another FA Cup final and in the top four. ” The only season Pep Guardiola won no trophies with Manchester City was 2016-17 - his first season in charge Lewis’ early opener silenced the 35,000 Forest fans behind the goal and Nuno Espirito Santo’s side failed to land a blow on City before the break. Substitute Anthony Elanga should have made it 1-1, firing wide a minute after coming on at the start of the second half, but Gvardiol’s 51st-minute header put the game beyond reach. Gibbs-White smacked the bar from the edge of the area with an audacious volley, before hitting the post from a tight angle after rounding City keeper Stefan Ortega following Gvardiol’s mistake. Taiwo Awoniyi also hit the woodwork with an instinctive effort following more Forest pressure. “We started really badly again, it makes everything hard. It took time to feel comfortable and adjust,” said Nuno. “The first half was difficult and in the second half the momentum changed a little bit. We had a couple of chances which could put the game in a different story. The boys gave it all, we have to accept we lost. ” Forest next host Brentford in the Premier League on Thursday, sitting sixth in the table but knowing victory will return them to third place and maintain their push for a Champions League spot. “It’s a sad day,” added Nuno. “It’s going to be hard, but when we wake up and the sadness is gone we know we have big things ahead of us to fight for. “It can only bring us more energy for the last moments of the season. ” Midfielder Gibbs-White also looked to lift Forest, who beat relegation on the final day of last season. He said: “We’ve got to put this behind us now and focus on the league. Five big finals, we are going to give it our absolute everything and hope for the best. ” This video can not be played Nuno on FA Cup defeat to Man City "

Guardiola’s side also suffered their earliest exit from the Champions League for 12 years after losing to Real Madrid in the knockout play-offs in February. They continued to stutter, thrashed 5-1 at Arsenal in February while Forest beat them 1-0 at the City Ground in March. But City have won six of their last seven games, including their last-gasp 2-1 success over top-five rivals Aston Villa on Tuesday. Midfielder Mateo Kovacic added: “We found ourselves again. The team is getting stronger, everyone is 100% focused. A lot of players came back very strong. “When we are all back we are a strong team. This season has not been how we wanted, but we are in another FA Cup final and in the top four. ” The only season Pep Guardiola won no trophies with Manchester City was 2016-17 - his first season in charge Lewis’ early opener silenced the 35,000 Forest fans behind the goal and Nuno Espirito Santo’s side failed to land a blow on City before the break. Substitute Anthony Elanga should have made it 1-1, firing wide a minute after coming on at the start of the second half, but Gvardiol’s 51st-minute header put the game beyond reach. Gibbs-White smacked the bar from the edge of the area with an audacious volley, before hitting the post from a tight angle after rounding City keeper Stefan Ortega following Gvardiol’s mistake. Taiwo Awoniyi also hit the woodwork with an instinctive effort following more Forest pressure. “We started really badly again, it makes everything hard. It took time to feel comfortable and adjust,” said Nuno. “The first half was difficult and in the second half the momentum changed a little bit. We had a couple of chances which could put the game in a different story. The boys gave it all, we have to accept we lost. ” Forest next host Brentford in the Premier League on Thursday, sitting sixth in the table but knowing victory will return them to third place and maintain their push for a Champions League spot. “It’s a sad day,” added Nuno. “It’s going to be hard, but when we wake up and the sadness is gone we know we have big things ahead of us to fight for. “It can only bring us more energy for the last moments of the season. ” Midfielder Gibbs-White also looked to lift Forest, who beat relegation on the final day of last season. He said: “We’ve got to put this behind us now and focus on the league. Five big finals, we are going to give it our absolute everything and hope for the best. ” This video can not be played Nuno on FA Cup defeat to Man City "

    "title": "Breaking: 'Twenty times' - but now Man Utd must exit 'Ice Age'",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - Experts revealed that Bruno Fernandes has led Manchester United into the Europa League semi-finals, but they will finish in the bottom half of the Premier League After an hour of Manchester United’s draw at Bournemouth, their travelling support struck up a familiar refrain. “Twenty times, 20 times, Man United. Twenty times, 20 times, I say. Twenty times, 20 times, Man United, playing football the Matt Busby way. ” The song has been a source of both pride and solace since United won the most recent of those championships to ease Sir Alex Ferguson into retirement in 2013. On Sunday, it felt particularly poignant. At the time they sang, those supporters did not know the day would end with Liverpool being crowned champions. But they knew it was coming. That very soon, their fierce rivals would join them on the total that had previously meant they stood alone as the most successful team in English football. And while Rasmus Hojlund’s injury-time equaliser prevented them experiencing yet another defeat in this torturous domestic campaign as they drew 1-1 at the Vitality Stadium, there is no disguising the reality of the situation. “Oh yes, it matters,” said Adam Bell - a long-time United fan, who started following the club in 1973-74, just as they were about to be relegated. “It was really important for us to get to 20. Now they are joining us and you have to say they have a better chance of getting to 21 and 22 than we have. ” His friend Andrew Harris agreed. “But if you look back,” he said, “this kind of thing happens in cycles at Manchester United. “We had the Busby Babes and the 1968 team, then we dropped back in the 1970s and 1980s, then Fergie came. Now we are in the next Ice Age. ” After David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Erik ten Hag tried, it is Ruben Amorim’s turn to attempt to prise United out of the deep freeze. His results since replacing Ten Hag in November have been patchy. The draw at Bournemouth means United have collected two points from their past five games. It lifted them a place to 14th but they are still heading for their worst finish since the relegation season over half a century ago. The nadir since then was 13th place in 1989-90, when Liverpool won their 18th league crown. What Amorim has done is to understand the history around Old Trafford. To his credit, he also refuses to dodge a question. Liverpool and their achievements, he said, were not his concern. What he thinks about Manchester United is another matter. “The first thing is to focus on ourselves and not on the other teams,” he said. “The next thing is to be really honest. “We are in different levels [to Liverpool] in this moment. But I remember when I start seeing Premier League, was the opposite. So, everything can change. ” Amorim said United must not try to think too far ahead. “We have an ultimate goal that is winning the Premier League,” he said. “I’m not crazy, I know it’s not going to be next year. But we are trying to build something and the small things we did during this year are really important. “We need to improve next year, we know that. ” This video can not be played Man Utd deserved late draw at Bournemouth - Amorim There is support for Amorim in the fanbase, even if they don’t all feel the salvation that would come from a Europa League triumph this season is realistic. In an ordinary season, a two-legged semi-final with Athletic Bilbao - fourth in La Liga - would be regarded as tricky. Ferguson’s team couldn’t beat them in a 2011-12 Europa League last-16 tie when Andoni Iraola - now Bournemouth manager - played for them. This season, many fans will have hope rather than expectation. Victory in the final in Bilbao - which, of course, offers United’s opponents even more incentive - not only provides Champions League riches but is also their only route back into Europe full stop. “I hope the project to rebuild works but it is going to take a few years,” said Bell. “Even winning the Europa League is a long shot. “I like Amorim. I am positive about him, but we need patience. It takes time to build a team and make them successful. It took Sir Alex Ferguson a long time. ” Ferguson was three and three-quarter seasons into his tenure before he delivered the trophy that changed United’s history for the better. The parallels with that season and this are impossible to ignore given the respective league positions. There was no social media then, no 24-hour rolling news cycle and endless talk on infinite platforms for opinion to be expressed on the club’s dysfunctional results. “Two to three years” was Bell’s assessment on the time Amorim will need. His friend is not so sure. “Ten,” he said, referring back to his Ice Age comment, “using the same Glacial calendar. “It is not going to be instant, that’s for sure. ” Latest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views Get Man Utd news notifications "

    "title": "New: Beijing seizes tiny sandbank in South China Sea",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - Let’s dive into the details: The Chinese coastguard has seized a tiny sandbank in the South China Sea, state media has reported, in an escalation of a regional dispute with the Philippines. State broadcaster CCTV released images of four officers, wearing all black and holding the Chinese flag, standing on the disputed reef of Sandy Cay in the Spratly Islands. CCTV said China had “implemented maritime control and exercised sovereign jurisdiction” on the reef earlier in April. Both China and the Philippines have staked claims on various islands. The Philippines said later on Sunday that it had landed on three sandbanks, releasing an image of officers holding up their national flag in a pose that mimicked the Chinese photo. It is unclear whether one of the sandbanks the Philippines security forces landed on was also Sandy Cay. In a statement, the National Task Force West Philippine Sea (NTF-WPS) said it witnessed “the illegal presence” of a Chinese Coastguard vessel 1,000 yards (914 metres) from one of the sandbanks, as well as seven Chinese militia vessels. “This operation reflects the unwavering dedication and commitment of the Philippine Government to uphold the country’s sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction in the West Philippine Sea,” the statement said. The dispute between the two nations has been escalating, with frequent confrontations including vessels colliding and scuffles. Sandy Cay is near a Philippine military outpost on Thitu Island, also known as Pag-asa, which Manila reportedly uses to track Chinese movements in the area. There is no sign that China is permanently occupying the 200 sq metre island and the coastguard is reported to have left. The White House said reports of China seizing the reef were “deeply concerning if true”. In comments reported by the Financial Times, James Hewitt, US National Security Council spokesperson, warned that “actions like these threaten regional stability and violate international law”, adding that the White House was “consulting closely with our own partners”. The Chinese move comes as US and Philippine forces are carrying out their annual war scenario drills - called the Balikatan exercises. China has criticised the drills as provocative. As many as 17,000 personnel are taking part in the coming days. Missiles from the US Marine Air Defense Integrated System were fired off the coast of the northern Philippines on Sunday, the system’s second live fire test and its first deployment to the Philippines. The drills are also set to feature the US anti-ship missile system NMESIS. The Philippines military says the drills are a rehearsal for national defence but insists they are not directed at any particular country. “This type of training is absolutely invaluable to us,” said Third Marine Littoral Regiment Officer John Lehane. The exercise has helped allay fears among some US allies that Donald Trump may upend the years-long military support it has provided in the region. On a visit to Manila last month, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said Washington was “doubling down” on its alliance with the country and was determined to “re-establish deterrence” against China. There have been wrangles over territory in the South China Sea for centuries, but tension has grown in recent years. China claims by far the largest portion of territory in an area demarcated by its so-called “nine-dash line”. The line comprises nine dashes which extends hundreds of miles south and east from its most southerly province of Hainan. Beijing has backed its expansive claims with island-building and naval patrols. Competing claimants such as Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei have staked claims on islands and various zones in the sea. "

Sam Ruddock from Rugby in Warwickshire, who has competed in shot put, cycling and sprinting, had travelled to the United States to watch a WrestleMania event and was last heard from on 16 April. His close friend Lucy Hatton said his disappearance was “really, really out of character” but that he had not “been in quite the right head space” recently. She said Las Vegas police were aware and were treating him as a missing person. Ms Hatton said her friend, who has cerebral palsy, was a “fantastic human being” who enjoyed going into schools to “inspire the next generation”. She said she drove him to the airport on 13 April and knew he had been staying at a hostel in Las Vegas before the big wrestling event. Mr Ruddock was “very active on social media”, she said, so when all contact stopped on 16 April, she said “it started to raise flags”. His mother, Fran Ruddock from Lincoln, said he normally spoke to her every day and was usually “very sociable”. She asked anyone who might know him, in the UK or United States, to get in touch if they had information. “Anything at all to piece together the gaps,” she said. Along with his mother, Ms Hatton said she alerted the police in the UK and they raised the case with police in the United States and with Interpol. She said she had also spoken to the hostel where he had been staying and was told he had not checked out, but his possessions had been left in his room. British Cycling said it understood he had been reported missing to police in the United States and the UK. A spokesperson added: “We urge anyone who has been in contact with Sam since 16 April or may have any information of his whereabouts to contact their local police department as soon as possible. ” Lincolnshire Police confirmed there was an active missing persons investigation.

    "body": "2025/04/27 - Experts revealed that Daniel Dubois (left) has claimed 21 of his 22 victories by knockout Daniel Dubois and Oleksandr Usyk will fight to become the undisputed world heavyweight champion at Wembley Stadium on 19 July. Briton Dubois is the IBF champion, with Usyk holding the WBA (Super), WBO and WBC belts. Usyk is undefeated in 23 fights and beat Dubois, 27, via a ninth-round stoppage in August 2023. The 38-year-old Ukrainian made history in May 2024 when he beat Tyson Fury to become the first undisputed heavyweight champion of the four-belt era. Usyk, who was also undisputed at cruiserweight, vacated the IBF belt prior to his rematch with Fury in December. Dubois was upgraded to IBF champion as a result and successfully defended the belt against Anthony Joshua last September. He was set to make a second defence against Joseph Parker in February but illness forced him to withdraw from the bout in fight week. “This is the fight I wanted and demanded and now I get my chance for revenge,” said Dubois. “I should have won the first fight and was denied by the judgement of the referee, so I will make no mistake this time around in front of my people at the national stadium in my home city. “I am a superior and more dangerous fighter now and Usyk will find this out for himself. ” No British boxer has held the undisputed heavyweight title in the four-belt era, and the last Briton to be undisputed heavyweight champion was Lennox Lewis in 1999. Usyk last competed in December when he earned a second win against Fury. “I’m grateful to God for the opportunity to once again fight for the undisputed championship,” said Usyk. “Thank you, Daniel, for taking care of my IBF belt - now I want it back. ” By Coral Barry - senior combat sports journalist Dubois fired himself into superstar status when he stopped Joshua at Wembley Stadium. The Londoner has risen from defeats to mould himself into a world champion with a seemingly unshakeable confidence. Usyk, on the other hand, has made a career of breaking British hearts and will aim to do it again when he meets Dubois. Having swept two-time heavyweight world champion Joshua aside, Dubois now has his sights on felling another of the old guard in the Ukrainian. But were it any other fighter, an 11-year age gap would prompt discussions about a passing-of-the-torch moment, but such is Usyk’s pedigree he will be clear favourite. The fight will represent a full-circle moment for Dubois, whose mental fortitude was called into question after his loss to Usyk almost three years ago in Poland. There was also the small matter of the controversy of the low blow as Dubois was mere centimetres away from knocking down Usyk and perhaps finishing the fight. There are not many who would have predicted Dubois would be the one to knock Usyk off his perch - that was supposed to be Fury - but in July, on home turf, Dubois will have the chance to banish demons and claim his spot at the top of the heavyweight mountain.

    "body": "2025/04/27 - Experts revealed that Nunavut is Canada’s largest federal district. The entire territory - all 1. 8 million sq km (695,000 sq miles) and its 40,000 people - will be represented by one person in parliament. “Nunavut is at least three times the size of France. If it was its own country, it would be the 13th largest behind Greenland,” Kathy Kettler, the campaign manager for local Liberal candidate Kilikvak Kabloona, told the BBC. Located in the Arctic, where average temperatures in the capital city Iqaluit are below freezing for eight months of the year, it is so vast and inaccessible that the only way to travel between its 25 communities is by air. “Yesterday, in 24 hours, we travelled 1,700 km (1,050 miles) by air and campaigned in Pangnirtung, Iqaluit, Rankin Inlet, and Arviat,” said Ms Kettler. “There are not very many people who understand the reality of the north,” Ms Kettler said, describing the challenges of running a campaign where so much is different from southern Canada. She recalled knocking on doors earlier this month as she campaigned for her candidate in -24C (-11F) temperatures. She said it’s rare in northern communities for people to knock before entering someone’s home. Instead, the tight-knit culture permits visitors to simply “walk in and say hello” - almost unthinkable in other parts of the country. As an Inuk from northern Quebec, she said it “feels weird” even for her to knock and wait for a response. In Nunavut, one of Canada’s three northern territories, the majority-Inuit population speak Inuktitut. Ms Kettler said one of the biggest expenses was translating campaign signs and hiring an interpreter for Kabloona, the candidate. Election issues for northerners too are unique. “The national campaign is really focused on Arctic security and sovereignty, whereas our campaign here is focused on food security and people being able to survive,” Ms Kettler said. Food can be prohibitively expensive and there are infrastructure challenges to accessing clean water for a number of Indigenous and northern communities. She was boiling water to drink while campaigning in Arviat, she said, and described being unable to rely on calling voters as she canvasses because a phone plan is the first thing they sacrifice to afford food. The seat is currently held by the New Democratic Party (NDP), with incumbent Lori Idlout running for re-election. James Arreak is the Conservative candidate. Jean-Claude Nguyen, the returning officer in Nunavut, is responsible for conducting the election in the district. He described how difficult it is to ensure ballots and voter lists get to every community - including to workers at remote gold mines. “[Elections Canada] sent a team from our Ottawa headquarters via Edmonton and Yellowknife to the mine where they work, gave them sufficient time to vote, and then they brought the ballots back,” he said. Mr Nguyen also spoke about security considerations. Once polls close, the ballots are counted at the polling station and then stored safely either with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), or a local hamlet - a small community that provides municipal services to its residents. The ballot boxes are then flown to Iqaluit, and then to Ottawa. Mr Nguyen recalled how in the 2019 election, a ballot box arrived with a big hole. “When we asked the charter flight company what happened, they said it was eaten by a raven,” he said laughing. “That’s part of the reality here in the territories, you have wild animals eating the ballot boxes. ” No ballots were damaged by the bird. Beyond all the challenges, Kathy Kettler said she is most drawn to the spirit of the people. “The generosity, love, and care that people have for each other in every community shines through,” she said. “That’s what keeps me going, and it’s what makes campaigning across Nunavut so meaningful. ” "

It was a seventh victory out of seven for Pulse but they were made work hard by the winless Dragons in the opening half and only led 32-25 at the break before pulling away after the interval. Liv Tchine once again led the Pulse scoring with 25 goals but there was a strong display by Sophie Kelly who finished with eight goals and her all-round efforts earned her the player of the match award.

Fresh from their first win of the season last week, Panthers were brimming with confidence at Sir David Wallace Arena and made it difficult for the hosts. But the defending champions kept their composure as experienced Lightning shooter Samantha Wallace-Joseph scored 34 goals, while England goal attack Berri Neil added 16. But Panthers had their opportunities and will consider themselves unlucky not to come away with more than the one point they will receive for keeping the deficit to less than five goals. Shooter Sigi Burger was clinical under the post, scoring 37 goals, while Betsy Creak added 10 and the defence worked tirelessly to gain possession of the ball 16 times to 10 from their opponents.

    "title": "New: 'Grandpa robbers' held Kim Kardashian at gunpoint - but didn't know who she was",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - It has been recently reported that The morning after the heist, burglar Yunice Abbas went home to catch up on some sleep. When he woke up, his wife was glued to the TV. The headline news of the day was that American reality TV star Kim Kardashian, 35, had been tied up and robbed at gunpoint in a luxury Paris apartment. All her jewellery had been taken for a sum of about $10m (£7. 5m) – including the engagement ring her then-husband and rapper Kanye West gifted her, which alone was worth $4m (£3m). Yunice Abbas’ wife glared at him. “This has you written all over it,” she grumbled. She was right. The 62-year-old had dabbled in crime his whole life, from petty offences to bank heists. The Kardashian robbery, he later wrote in a memoir, was going to be his last job before retirement. But a series of blunders meant the heist was doomed from the start and in early 2017 - three months after the robbery - Abbas and several of his alleged accomplices were arrested. Ten of them will now be appearing in court in Paris in a trial set to last just under three weeks. Out of those, five are accused of taking part in the heist, and six are accused of being accessories to the crime. Most of them were born in the 1950s, leading French media to dub them the “grandpa robbers”. Abbas and a 68-year-old man, Aomar Ait Khedache, have confessed; the others have not. One has since passed away, and another, aged 81, will be excused as he is suffering from advanced dementia. By the time the trial starts, almost nine years will have gone by since the heist. On the night between 2 and 3 October 2016, Abbas and four accomplices allegedly staked out Kardashian’s discreet suite in Hotel de Pourtalès, in the glitzy Madeleine neighbourhood in Paris, not far from the Opéra and Place Vendome. At around 03:00 local time, they burst into the hotel’s entrance hall, dressed as policemen and wielding a gun. They threatened and handcuffed Abderrahmane Ouatiki, an Algerian PhD student who regularly took up shifts as night receptionist, and marched him up to Kardashian’s room. She was resting on her bed, tired from days of attending Paris Fashion Week events, when she heard stomping up the stairs. She called out for her sister Kourtney and her stylist Stephanie, but when they didn’t answer she panicked. “I knew someone was there to get me,” she recalled in an interview with US interviewer David Letterman years later. “You just feel it. ” Kim dialled 911 but the number, of course, didn’t work outside of the US. As she was calling her then-security guard Pascal Duvier - who had accompanied her sister to a club - the men burst in, pushed her on the bed and started shouting. “They kept on saying: the ring, the ring! And I was so startled that it didn’t compute for a minute,” she told Letterman. The language barrier meant Ouatiki had to act as an interpreter. They grabbed the ring and several other jewels, as well as 1000 euros in cash. One of the men grabbed her and pulled her towards him. Because she was wearing a robe with nothing underneath, she thought he was going to assault her, Kim later told Letterman, wiping tears away. But instead – using the technique of saucissonnage, or the practice of tying them up like a saucisson, a salami - the man bound her with zip ties and duct tape, and left her in the bathroom. Then, he and the rest of the burglars fled on bikes and on foot. Kim freed herself of her restraints, and shortly after her security guard turned up. Traumatised, Kim gave a statement to French police in the early hours of the morning and flew back to the US by dawn. It wasn’t until the next morning, when Abbas caught a glimpse of the TV screen his wife was watching, that he understood who their victim was. “There were breaking news alerts saying Kim Kardashian had been robbed at gunpoint – that’s how important it was,” says LA-based entertainment journalist KJ Matthews. “We were so fascinated with her and her family and their rise to fame… When the heist happened we were so surprised. How could burglars have gotten so close to her?” Matthews says. But while mistakes were made in terms of Kardashian’s security, serious errors were made on the burglars’ side, too. “They didn’t take into account the progress made by police techniques, which can now find micro traces of DNA anywhere,” said Patricia Tourancheau, a crime reporter and the author of “Kim and the grandpa robbers” - a thorough account of the heist and of the lives of its perpetrators. “When they dressed up as police they thought ‘that’s it, nobody will be able to recognise us’,” she adds. But in 2016 Paris was still reeling from the terrorist attacks of the previous year, and there were a huge number of CCTV cameras all round the city, meaning police were able to spot the thieves and see them make off with the jewels. Other details of this story suggest that the thieves’ planning was rather haphazard. When fleeing the scene on a bike, Abbas fell, dropping a bag of jewels. The next day, a passer-by found a diamond-encrusted necklace and wore it all day at the office before watching the news and realising where it had come from. Police arrested Abbas and several other people in January 2017 and later confirmed that they had been under surveillance for several weeks, after DNA traces left at the scene provided a match with Aomar Ait Khedache, also known as “Omar the Old”. French media published a photo from the police stakeout, which shows several of the men having coffee and chatting at a Parisian café that winter, just before their arrest. The question that remains - and which will undoubtedly be explored doing the trial - is just how the gang got wind of Kardashian’s schedule. Court documents seen by the BBC show that both Khedache and Abbas stated that all the information they needed was posted online by Kardashian herself, whose very career was built on sharing details about her life and movements. But how did the gang know that on the night of 2 October Kardashian would be alone in her room, without her security guard? Court documents indicate police believe Gary Madar, whose brother Michael’s firm had provided transportation and taxis to the Kardashians for years, was an accessory to the heist and that he had fed information to the gang about Kim’s whereabouts. Mr Madar was arrested in January 2017. His lawyer Arthur Vercken vehemently pushed back against the accusations, telling the BBC that “since the start the case was built on assumptions, theses, theories - but no proof [of Madar’s involvement] was ever found”. He added that although the Madar brothers exchanged texts about the Kardashians during Fashion Week it was just because they were “bored” and that when the heist took place Gary was asleep. Gary’s brother, Michael, is not a defendant. “Five men did this. You don’t think one of them was keeping an eye on who was coming and going from her hotel?” he said, suggesting that Mr Madar had only been arrested “to prove that the French justice system works”. The trial will also attempt to determine where the jewels ended up. Police tracking of the gang’s phones showed that soon after the heist Omar the Old travelled from Paris to Antwerp in Belgium, where 50% of the world’s polished diamonds and 80% of rough diamonds are sold, according to the Diamond Investment Office. Many jewels were reportedly melted or broken up and sold. Abbas got 75,000 euro (£64,000); others far less. As for Kim Kardashian’s engagement ring, Omar the Old said the gang was too scared to sell it on as it would be too easily traceable. It has never been found. Kim Kardashian was undoubtedly spooked by the event, which marked the start of her social media hiatus. In an episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, she tearfully recalled the night of the heist and said had been scared for her life; later she also said the robbery had made her a “less materialistic person”. Soon after the incident her sister Khloe told The Ellen DeGeneres that, for safety reasons, the Kardashian family were making some changes to how freely they posted on social media. “The biggest change was her security detail,” KJ Matthews told the BBC. Patricia Tourancheau, the author of the book about the heist, said she was “fascinated” by the “clash between these old-style burglars from the Parisian banlieue and this global social media star”. “They fled on bikes and she flies around on private jets,” she laughed. “These are a group of elderly down-and-out thieves, they’re always broke, they’re forever involved in convoluted plans… and they’re facing a huge celebrity and they don’t even know who she is. ” The gang was not “elite” as it was suggested in the early days, she added. “This isn’t the creme de la creme of French banditry. They’re a bit of a bunch of losers, really. They’re the same kind of people who in the 60s and 70s would burglar banks or post offices and who then rebranded to drug trafficking and then moved on to jewels because it was easier,” she said. Around mid-May, Kim will face the suspects for the first time in years when she takes the stand as a witness. Cameras are not allowed in French courts but her arrival to the tribunal on Ile de la Cité alone will inevitably spark the same media frenzy that has accompanied her for over a decade. In his memoir, Abbas expressed the hope the victim’s status and the global resonance of the case would not influence judges unduly. However, he also said that on the last day of the trial he would bring a duffle bag with his belongings, ready to be sent to jail. “The problem with the past,” he wrote, “is that it sticks with you as long as you live”.

    "title": "Breaking: Israel launches air strike on Beirut",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - It has been recently reported that Israel carried out an air strike on Beirut’s southern suburbs on Sunday, after ordering an evacuation of a building that it said was being used by the Iranian-backed group Hezbollah. The attack occurred despite a ceasefire that came into force five months ago which put an end to the conflict between Israel and the military group. Israel said that it had targeted a Hezbollah store of “precision-guided missiles” that “poses a threat to the State of Israel and its civilians”. The Lebanese presidency condemned the strike and called on the US and France - who brokered the ceasefire in November - to press Israel to cease its attacks on the country. The attack marks the first time in almost a month that Israel has struck Beirut’s southern suburbs - called Dahieh - where Hezbollah is based. This will put further pressure on the ceasefire. Despite the deal, Israel has struck targets it says are linked to Hezbollah almost every day. The Israeli government has said that it will respond to any perceived threats from Hezbollah. Western officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have told the BBC that the militant group has been largely compliant with the truce, while accusing Israel of multiple violations that include air strikes and drone surveillance. Live footage streamed by Reuters showed a giant plume of smoke billowing from the targeted building an hour after the Israeli army issued an evacuation order to residents of the Hadath neighbourhood. Lebanon’s Civil Defence later said that no casualties had been recorded and rescue crews had extinguished the fire. In a statement on X following the strike, the Lebanese Presidency said that President Joseph Aoun condemned the attack. “The United States and France, as guarantors of the cessation of hostilities agreement, must assume their responsibilities and compel Israel to immediately cease its attacks,” it wrote. “Israel’s continued undermining of stability will exacerbate tensions and expose the region to real threats to its security and stability. ” Israel’s government said that it had targeted a Hezbollah store of “precision-guided missiles”. “The storage of missiles in this infrastructure site constitutes a blatant violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon, and poses a threat to the State of Israel and its civilians,” the Israeli military said in a statement. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said that Israel “will not allow Hezbollah to grow stronger”. “The Dahiyeh neighbourhood in Beirut will not serve as a safe haven for the terrorist organisation Hezbollah,” it added. UN Special Coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, wrote on X that the strike “generated panic and fear of renewed violence among those desperate for a return to normalcy”. “We urge all sides to halt any actions that could further undermine the cessation of hostilities understanding,” she added. Earlier this month an Israeli airstrike in Beirut’s southern suburbs killed four people, including a Hezbollah official. "

The Reds defeated Tottenham Hotspur 5-1 at Anfield on Sunday to clinch a record-equalling 20th top-flight title, with Slot becoming the first Dutch coach to win the Premier League. “It feels great. I don’t think I want to say a lot. The only thing now is to send my appreciation to Jurgen Klopp,” Slot, who replaced Klopp as Liverpool manager last summer, told LFCTV. The 46-year-old immediately launched into a rendition of the song Klopp asked Liverpool fans to sing after his final game last May, but replaced the lyrics ‘Arne Slot’ with ‘Jurgen Klopp’. “I am 99. 9% sure that if I pick up my phone there will be a message from Jurgen,” he told BBC Match of the Day. “So many moments in the season the two of us have had contact. I think he showed last season what a wonderful human being he is by introducing me. “But what mattered most is the team he left behind that was able to win the trophy. ” Slot, speaking to Sky Sports, added: “The work Jurgen and Pep [Lijnders] did - the culture, work-rate, quality - was outstanding,” This video can not be played Commentary cam scenes as Liverpool win title Few expected Slot to oversee a successful title charge in his first season at Anfield, not least the man himself. “We started really well and maybe it helped that [Manchester] City had a difficult spell that they have not had in five years,” he said. “When the season started, we would have been happy with top four. But I don’t think that is fair on the players as they are much better than that and they have shown it this season. ” Dominic Solanke gave Spurs a surprise lead at Anfield, but Slot had no doubts his side would turn things around. “I think from the moment we arrived on the bus everyone could feel that we were never going to lose this game,” he told BBC Match of the Day. “The fans were so supportive before and during the game. Even at 1-0 down you felt this team and the fans could get it over the line. ” He told LFCTV: “They always find a way to win. I’m incredibly proud, not only of the players but the people standing here, sport directors, my staff members, we should give them a big round of applause. “Let’s forget it’s the second title in 35 years… it’s the second in five years. ” Liverpool crowned Premier League champions with thumping win over Tottenham - reaction ‘No-one expected this’ - how Slot guided Liverpool to the title Liverpool rejoin Man Utd on ‘perch’ with 20th title Liverpool last won the Premier League five years ago, but the Coronavirus pandemic meant there were no fans inside Anfield to witness it.

The feeling is unbelievable. The first time was lockdown and the pandemic, but to be here five years later is incredible. ” Salah told Sky Sports: “This is 100% better than last time. ” Virgil van Dijk - the first non-British captain to lead Liverpool to a top flight title - dedicated the triumph to the club’s supporters. “I was desperate to win it for them [the fans] and all the fans around the world, and for us as well,” Van Dijk told Sky Sports. “This is the most beautiful club in the world.

We enjoyed it of course but you cannot beat what we experienced today. Nothing compares to that. “It is special. For me, when I came to this club I quickly realised how good Scottish players have been here. There is a bit of pressure with that. I am glad I managed to continue that and hopefully can carry that forward. ” It has been a remarkable few years for midfielder Alexis Mac Allister, who won the 2022 World Cup with Argentina before joining Liverpool in 2023. “To win a World Cup and now a Premier League is really special,” he said. “But it would not be possible without my team-mates. I am just one part of the puzzle. This team has been really good the last two years. “It wasn’t enough last year but this year we made a big difference. Hopefully we can enjoy this week. ” 20 of the best photos from Liverpool’s momentous day ‘A moment 35 years in the making, this was Anfield’s day of destiny’ Despite uncertainty regarding his future hanging over him for much of this season, Salah has been sensational. His 63rd-minute goal on Sunday was his 28th of the season, while he has set up another 18 for his team-mates. “It’s incredible.

Jurgen [Klopp] is not here and other players I respect a lot are not here, but to do it with a new manager and a new team shows what I’m capable of. ” Defending their title will not be easy, but having committed his immediate future to the club with a new two-year contract earlier this month, Salah is confident. “People think it’s going to get easier, but now it’s going to be difficult because other teams will catch us and it’s going to be harder for him [Slot],” he said. “Even in my time here, the second season was way harder. “I believe next season and the year after will be great, for sure. ” Slot shared his star man’s optimism. “That is something we are definitely going to try [to defend the title],” he told BBC Match of the Day. “But first we are going to enjoy the last few games. ” This video can not be played Murphy on phenomenal first season for Slot "

    "body": "2025/04/27 - Here’s what you need to know: One of two women seriously injured in an attack involving a crossbow and a firearm in Leeds has undergone surgery for “life-threatening injuries”. Counter Terrorism Policing North East said the “isolated incident” involving the women aged 19 and 31, happened on Otley Road, in the Headingley area, at about 14:47 BST on Saturday. One of the women was sent home from hospital earlier while the other, who underwent surgery, was now in a stable condition, police said. A 38-year-old man, who officers said was “the key suspect”, remains in hospital in a critical condition, under police guard, after suffering a “self-inflicted injury”. The incident occurred on Otley Road in Headingley while people were taking part in the popular Otley Run pub crawl. Cordons around the scene on Otley Road were removed on Sunday evening. Det Ch Supt James Dunkerley said: “The investigation continues and officers are working at pace to establish the full facts and circumstances of Saturday’s incident. “We are not currently seeking anyone else in connection with this matter, which has caused understandable concern. We believe it was an isolated incident. ” Alison Lowe, deputy mayor of West Yorkshire for policing and crime, said the man was being held under police guard. She said: “The suspect injured themselves and is now in hospital under police guard so the threat has been eliminated. ” Lowe reassured the public and said there would be an increased police presence across Headingley in “the coming days and weeks”. “This is a very, very rare incident and the police know that the public are very frightened, so there is a much bigger police presence. “I would be scared if I had witnessed or been close to an incident of that magnitude. “All I can say to those women and girls is that we’re here for you. We’re increasing those patrols. ” MP for Leeds Central and Headingley, Alex Sobel, said the incident raised concerns about the safety of the Otley Run. He said: “We need to look at the numbers and see what we can do to ensure safety on the Otley Run. “This is really serious and shocking and nobody foresaw that anything like this would happen, but we have had other issues, just because of the huge volume of people who come every Saturday and the growth in it. “Because of this we’re going to have to look really deeply at how Otley Run operates. ” Headingley resident Vasileios Balampanos described seeing the aftermath of the incident. He said he saw paramedics treating someone further up Otley Road and “a couple of distressed individuals, students mostly”. “It was quite scary,” he said. “Generally, this is a quiet area but we have plenty of people doing the Otley Run and going to the pub. It can get busy sometimes. ” Headingley councillor Abdul Hannan said his thoughts were with the victims and said the council was working closely with the police and reassuring the community. “It’s horrific,” he said. “There is a lot of footfall in that area, it is a busy stretch, especially on a Saturday. “It is a tragedy what has taken place. ” Listen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North.

    "body": "2025/04/27 - Let’s dive into the details: Bevan French has scored eight tries in all competitions for Wigan Warriors so far this season Betfred Super League Hull FC (12) 12 Tries: Pryce, Barron Goals: Sezer Wigan (22) 36 Tries: French 2, Field, Nsemba 2, Wardle, Miski Goals: Keighran 4 Wigan Warriors moved up to second in the Super League table courtesy of a classy win against Hull FC at the KCOM Stadium. The visitors raced out the blocks and led inside five minutes through Bevan French, but Will Pryce cut inside to get the hosts on the board. Jai Field weaved his way through to restore Wigan’s lead, with Junior Nsemba and Jake Wardle adding to their tally after Harvey Barron’s reply for Hull. Abbas Miski’s dive to the corner and Bevan French’s cross-field run-in put Wigan out of sight, while Nsemba’s late drive put further polish on a comprehensive performance. Wigan wasted no time in taking the lead as French capitalised on a communication breakdown in the Hull defence to race on to a loose ball and go to ground for his sixth Super League try of 2025. Such was their fervour to maintain that early lead that no sooner did Pryce try to gain ground for the hosts on the wing, he was turfed in to touch by a crowd of opponents. Undeterred, however, Pryce was influential both in the build-up and process of putting them ahead, racing through a gap to get his side in touching distance and then later latching on to a pass to dummy through for his first try since joining the club last month. There was an error from the hosts straight from the restart, however, as Lewis Martin had a foot in touch when he received the kick and Wigan took full advantage of their field position in the aftermath as Field twisted his way into crossing over moments later. Hull kept pace once again, this time as Aidan Sezer’s kick was met by Barron, but Nsemba ducked and dived his way to the line to send Wigan further ahead with a bit of style. Wigan added some sheen to a classy first-half performance as Wardle strolled through with ease at the corner after Hull failed to pick him up. After the break, Miski’s try was given by video referee Ben Thaler after it was judged he did not land over the line in the process of Hull’s attempt to thwart his audacious drive to the corner. French’s lung-busting run from 80 metres put the visitors out of sight and brought up his tally to three tries against the Airlie Birds this season, having also scored in their 46-4 thrashing of their opponents back in February. Nsemba’s late try helped Wigan see out the game in style and remain two points behind leaders Hull KR after nine games. Hull FC boss John Cartwright: “I’m not worried about where the game is to be honest with you. Losing is the concern and how you play. “If you start giving that (Hull’s winless run) air, then you start thinking about it. For me, it’s a great stadium to play at, we’ve just got to find out groove. “We’ve played Wigan twice here, KR twice here â two standouts in the competition and just unfortunate that we’ve had them so early in the season. “I do see brighter times. For us, the honeymoon is probably over, but on the back of last season we’ve had a pretty good start. This middle nine to 10 weeks, that’s where you find out where you’re at. ” Wigan Warriors head coach Matt Peet: “I’m proud of the lads, no doubt.

    "title": "Update: 'No-one expected this' - how Slot guided Liverpool to the title",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - Experts revealed that ‘No-one expected this’ - how Slot guided Liverpool to the title “If you had asked Liverpool fans back in August would their team win the Premier League, most would have said no,” says former Reds goalkeeper Sander Westerveld. Jurgen Klopp was always going to be the hardest of acts to follow as manager. Liverpool supporters were understandably worried about the future when the charismatic German, whose force of personality and success gave him iconic status, announced in January 2024 he was leaving at the end of that season. Who would undertake the seemingly impossible task of replacing Klopp? Would Liverpool tread water or even go backwards for a season or two while his successor settled in? “Klopp was a sort of god who changed the club - not just on the pitch but the whole atmosphere,” says Westerveld. Former Reds midfielder Xabi Alonso, who had taken Bayer Leverkusen to the brink of a first Bundesliga title, was strongly linked with a return before announcing he was staying in Germany. That paved the way for Arne Slot’s appointment. “At that moment I didn’t even think about Arne,” says his fellow Dutchman Westerveld, who has remained friends with Slot since their playing days at Sparta Rotterdam in 2007-08. “Nobody in England knew an awful lot about him. Everybody who knows football said it was going to be a huge task and that this was an unknown coach who comes from the Netherlands. ” Yet the transition from Klopp to Slot has been seamless, culminating in Liverpool winning the title for a record-equalling 20th time. With 25 wins in 34 games and just two defeats, Slot’s side have made top spot their own and have looked down on the rest of the Premier League since 2 November. And now they are champions - with four games to spare - for just the second time since 1989-90. Slot, who ruled himself out of the running to become the next Spurs boss while at Feyenoord in May 2023, has joined an elite band of bosses in the Premier League era to have delivered the title in their first season in charge. Jose Mourinho (2004-05) and Carlo Ancelotti (2009-10) both managed it at Chelsea before Manuel Pellegrini (2013-14) accomplished the feat at Manchester City. The last boss to do so before Slot was Antonio Conte - also at Chelsea - in 2016-17. “Nobody expected this,” says Ian Doyle - chief Liverpool writer for the Liverpool Echo. “In terms of an achievement for a manager in his first season at Liverpool, it has to be right up there. ” Neil Atkinson, presenter and CEO of Liverpool fans’ podcast and website The Anfield Wrap, says: “I don’t think anyone wanted the new manager to come in and try to be a Jurgen Klopp tribute act. “All Liverpool fans wanted was Slot to be himself - and that’s what he has been. ” Liverpool clinch Premier League title with thumping win over Spurs Slot thanks Klopp moments after Liverpool win title Liverpool rejoin Man Utd on ‘perch’ with 20th title In many ways, Slot’s main job has been to build on and improve the outstanding squad left behind by his predecessor, who averaged 80. 33 points in his last three seasons at Anfield. Three more victories would mean Liverpool break the 90-point barrier after Slot tightened the defence and brought more control to the midfield. “They’ve amassed these points by winning when it’s hard, winning when it’s ugly, winning when the opposition have put up a fight,” adds Atkinson. “Liverpool have managed to do that - none of their rivals have. ” While Federico Chiesa was the only addition to Slot’s squad for this season, the Dutch coach has improved players, including Ryan Gravenberch, who has grasped his opportunity at the base of Liverpool’s midfield after the club missed out on signing Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad. With 28 Premier League goals and 18 assists in 34 appearances - compared to 18 goals and 10 assists in 32 appearances in Klopp’s final season - Mohamed Salah’s figures under Slot have been seriously impressive. Gravenberch’s Netherlands team-mate Cody Gakpo has provided 17 goals in all competitions in 2024-25, beating his tally from last season. “In his first meeting with the players, Arne had all the data from the season they were champions in 2019-20 and all the data from the final season under Klopp,” adds Westerveld. “Last season, compared to the title season, there were less sprints, the team was less effective. Instead of saying to the players, ‘come on, work hard’, he was telling them exactly what they had to do and needed to know showing them all the data. ” There have been tweaks off the field too, with Slot implementing a new routine for how his players build up to games. Under Klopp, the day would begin later, but this season players have been at the training ground in Kirkby, about six and a half miles from Anfield, at 9. 15am for breakfast. Slot and his backroom team have introduced a process known as ‘body wake-up’, which involves breathing exercises before both training and matches. Under Klopp, the Liverpool squad would stay together in a hotel before home games. That is no longer the case, with players allowed to remain at their own homes. Training sessions have been longer than before but less intense to reduce injury risk, with fitness issues undermining several campaigns in recent years. In addition, Slot has made key hires behind the scenes. Ruben Peeters, a specialist in periodisation (the science of optimising training loads), followed Slot from Feyenoord, Dr Jonathan Power was promoted to director of medicine and performance, while Amit Pannu joined as a new first-team doctor. 20 of the best photos from Liverpool’s momentous day Liverpool’s tactical tweaks under new boss Sander Westerveld (pictured, right, at Liverpool’s training ground) is a friend and former team-mate of Arne Slot Liverpool fans had plenty of time to get used to Slot before his first Premier League game in charge. There were three months between the Reds announcing him as their new head coach and the match at Ipswich on 17 August. It helped that Klopp, after his final match in charge, urged supporters to sing with him ‘Arne Slot, na na na na na’ to the tune of Opus’ Live Is Life before the German waved goodbye to Anfield - a chant that has become more and more popular at the ground as the season has gone on. “Before his first home game in front of 60,000, I asked Arne if he was nervous,” says Westerveld, who won the FA Cup, League Cup and Uefa Cup at Liverpool in 2000-01 under Gerard Houllier. “He said: ‘Oh well, you know, I was manager of Feyenoord and we had a stadium of 50,000 so I’m used to that. ’ “I said; ‘No, Arnie. No… this is Anfield, this is different. ’ He was downplaying everything. “Then I thought about it afterwards and Liverpool is perfect for him. He’s just a normal guy, down to earth, feet on the floor, very calm. For him everything is the same and he doesn’t change. “He didn’t get carried away when Liverpool won 11 of the first 12 games, and he didn’t panic when they lost the League Cup final five days after going out of the Champions League. ” One banner that has become a regular feature in The Kop this season refers to ‘Arne’s Slot Machine’ - a nod towards his popularity with supporters young and old. He has befriended Isaac Kearney - a Liverpool-obsessed seven-year-old, who was born with a rare condition known as Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, meaning he develops at a slower rate than other children his age. When the club heard about Isaac’s story, they invited him, his mum Melissa and dad Alan, and older sister Florence to the training ground to meet the players. They were told they might not see Slot as he was busy planning for a game. “Isaac was walking past the manager’s office with Mo [Salah] and Virgil [van Dijk] and Isaac being Isaac shouted ‘Arne’ through the window at him,” Melissa recalls. “Arne was in a meeting but came out to chat with Isaac. He was so genuine and down to earth. We sat down for lunch and Arne came over and was fist-bumping Isaac. “Arne asked if he was having a nice day and Isaac told him he was still waiting to see Trent [Alexander-Arnold]. Arne said: ‘I’m going to take you to meet him right now. ’” Before Liverpool’s home game with Southampton in March, Slot also name-checked Isaac in his pre-match news conference. Asked how he would cope with serving a touchline ban, the Reds boss said he would be sitting in the stand close to his friend Isaac. Slot spent time with Isaac Kearney (right), his mum Melissa, dad Alan and sister Florence after Liverpool invited the family to the training ground Slot comes across as likeable, approachable and intelligent in interviews, although there were occasions in his early days when he struggled to grasp the local dialect. Before Liverpool’s Champions League game with Bologna in October, a local reporter asked if preparations for a big European game were any different to a domestic match. “That was a bit of Scouse,” said Slot, struggling to understand the local accent before turning to Tony Barrett - director of first-team communications - for help. “He’s relaxed into the job,” adds Doyle. “Anyone who has seen his press conferences, he doesn’t mind a laugh and a joke. He’s mentioned in the past that his dad reads the newspapers. ” Arend Slot made the headlines in January when Arne revealed his dad was not impressed with the way the Reds performed in the 2-1 Champions League win over Lille. “When I called him after the game he says: ‘Ah, it wasn’t as exciting as other games of Liverpool,’” said Arne at the time. Doyle adds: “I haven’t seen him snap in press conferences but if he doesn’t believe a question is fair he’ll make a point of addressing that fact. “He always says ‘this season we’ve basically got what we deserved’ whether it’s after a win over Real Madrid in the Champions League or defeat by Newcastle in the League Cup final. ” Westerveld was at Goodison Park in February when Slot was shown a red card after a dramatic Merseyside derby ended 2-2, with Everton equalising in the 98th minute. “He looked really angry when he walked off the pitch and then he saw me and straight away he smiled,” he adds. “It’s like I said before… he doesn’t get too down. He’s exactly the same as he was in his first coaching role at Cambuur. ” Away from football in the Netherlands, Slot used to relax by playing golf with Westerveld, but since moving to Liverpool he keeps fit playing racquet sport padel with his backroom staff at the training ground. “Go home, eat, take the computer out, watch the training session back, prepare for the next meeting,” said Slot - whose family have remained in the Netherlands - when asked what he does after training. “He’s clearly a brilliant coach… and a serious minded person,” adds Atkinson. “His reaction to getting knocked out of the Champions League by Paris St-Germain wasn’t to bemoan the referee or blame injuries. “He said it was the best game he had ever coached in. He has shown genuine humility while simultaneously having a real sense of confidence in himself, his coaching staff and players. ” Liverpool fans have taken Slot to their hearts Not since they were champions in the early 1980s have Liverpool won back-to-back league titles. So will they build on this season’s incredible success? While there has been no need for a rebuild in 2024-25, Slot is expected to be active in the transfer market to ensure Liverpool are in a strong position next season. Although Salah has signed a new two-year contract and captain Virgil van Dijk has also committed his future, England international Alexander-Arnold is expected to move to Real Madrid. Reported Liverpool targets include Newcastle’s Sweden forward Alexander Isak and Bournemouth’s Hungary left-back Milos Kerkez. “I refuse to believe Slot will allow standards to slip next season,” adds Atkinson. “I think they’ll break 80 points again - and if you do that you have every chance of being in the conversation for the title. ” Westerveld will be at Anfield on 25 May, when Liverpool host Crystal Palace on the final day of the season, to see his friend and former team-mate show off the Premier League trophy. “To come from coaching in the Netherlands to the Premier League… I didn’t expect it to be so easy for him to adapt,” he admits. “At the start of the season I used to send him a message to congratulate him after a win. Then I sent him a message saying, ‘I’m not going to congratulate anymore because it’s getting boring’. ” This video can not be played I want to keep Liverpool at the top - Slot Latest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views Get Liverpool news sent straight to your phone "

    "title": "Update: Pogacar wins third Liege-Bastogne-Liege title",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - It has been recently reported that Tadej Pogacar now has nine Monument wins - level with Ireland’s Sean Kelly and Italians Costante Girardengo and Fausto Coppi in third most overall World champion Tadej Pogacar won his third Liege-Bastogne-Liege with a dominant showing in the Belgian one-day classic as Mauritian Kim le Court took the biggest win of her career in the women’s race. Slovenian Pogacar attacked on the Cote de la Redoute climb with 35km of the 252km course remaining and expertly stayed clear to defend his title, having also won in 2021. Italy’s Giulio Ciccone edged out Ireland’s Ben Healy to claim second, finishing just over a minute down on Pogacar. Pogacar, 26, is the first rider to finish on the podium in six successive ‘Monuments’ - the five most prestigious one-day races in men’s cycling. After winning Liege and Il Lombardia last year, he finished third at this year’s Milan-San Remo, won the Tour of Flanders and was runner-up at Paris-Roubaix. The three-time Tour de France champion has also finished on the podium in the past eight Monuments he has entered, winning five. This is Pogacar’s ninth Monument win overall. Only Eddy Merckx, widely regarded as the greatest cyclist of all time, with 19, and fellow Belgian great Roger de Vlaeminck (11) have more victories in these famous races. Victory in Belgium caps another stunning spring classics campaign by Pogacar, with the UAE Team Emirates-XRG rider also winning Strade Bianche and Fleche Wallonne, as well as narrowly finishing second in the Amstel Gold Race. Le Court had enjoyed two fifth-place finishes this spring in the Milan-San Remo and Tour of Flanders. But it was still a shock when the 29-year-old AG Insurance-Soudal rider came out on top in a four-way sprint for the line ahead of Dutch duo Puck Pieterse and Demi Vollering, and France’s Cedrine Kerbaol. “I can’t believe it. On the climb to La Roche-aux-Faucons [13 km from the finish line], I was completely out of breath. So to win ahead of the stars of the peloton, I can’t believe it,” said Le Court - the first African winner of a Monument race. World champion Lotte Kopecky was fifth. Pogacar overcomes wet conditions to win Fleche Wallonne Pogacar &amp; record-breaking Kopecky claim Tour of Flanders wins The race was billed as a showdown between Pogacar and Olympic champion Remco Evenepoel, who won back-to-back Liege titles in 2022 and 2023 before suffering multiple bone fractures in a serious crash on a training ride last year. However, the Belgian struggled, caught out of position when Pogacar attacked and later dropped by the peloton on the final climb of the day. Instead it was the familiar sight of Pogacar mounting an attack no-one could match. Britain’s Tom Pidcock attempted to bring him back alongside Healy but Pogacar built up a lead of 30 seconds within 5km and the gap kept growing. Ciccone and Julian Alaphilippe joined Pidcock and Healy but they could not get organised, with Ciccone and Healy eventually getting clear to compete for the two podium spots left. Pidcock finished ninth. In reality this was just about Pogacar’s increasingly possible quest to rival Merckx’s standing as the greatest. Pogacar is only the seventh rider to win three or more editions of Liege, the oldest of the Monuments, with Merckx holding the record of five wins. Mercx won five Tours de France - including 34 stages - five Giro d’Italia titles, one Vuelta a Espana and three world road crowns, as well as his 19 monuments. Pogacar has three Tour victories, including 17 stages, one Giro, one world title and nine monuments. Only Merckx (1974), Ireland’s Stephan Roche (1987) and Pogacar (2024) have completed the triple crown of winning the Giro, Tour and world championship in the same year. Pogacar is unlikely to win as many Giro titles as Merckx, given the demands of targeting the Tour each year, but every other tally could well be in his sights. After he attempts to defend his Tour title in July, Pogacar will be heavily favoured to claim a 10th Monument before the season ends at Il Lombardia in October. Pogacar has won the last four consecutive editions of the one-day race in Italy and will be seeking to equal Fausto Coppi’s record of five wins overall.

    "title": "Update: 'I know what's needed' - Bompastor after Chelsea's embarrassing exit",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - Let’s dive into the details: Chelsea are still on course for a domestic treble - despite their Women’s Champions League exit Another season, another Women’s Champions League failure. Chelsea might be closing in on a domestic treble but they appear further away than ever from triumphing in Europe. A second 4-1 setback to Barcelona in the space of a week saw their latest attempt to land the Champions League end in an embarrassing 8-2 semi-final aggregate defeat. Chelsea recruited Sonia Bompastor - who led Lyon to Champions League glory in 2022 - specifically to win the one trophy that had eluded former manager Emma Hayes. Speaking last September, the Frenchwoman said: “If we don’t achieve that goal I will be the one you need to blame. I am fine with that. ” On Sunday, after her team had been demolished by Barca, Bompastor did not shy away from what needs to happen for Chelsea to take the next step. “It didn’t happen this year but now we need to reflect on how we make it possible,” she said. “The only positive is in my head it is really clear what we need to do to compete for the Champions League. “We’re not shying away from the ambitions of the club. ” Chelsea suffer embarrassing Champions League exit This is the third successive season Chelsea have gone out to Barcelona at the semi-final stage. Whereas on the previous two occasions they lost 2-1 on aggregate, they were easily beaten this time. In the first leg, Chelsea conceded twice in the final 10 minutes to allow the holders to establish a commanding lead that was always going to be difficult to overturn. On Sunday, they were 3-0 down on the day, 7-1 on aggregate, before half-time. “The gulf you have seen between the two teams is absolutely huge,” former England midfielder Karen Carney told TNT Sports. Having established a healthy first-leg advantage, fans wondered how Barcelona would approach the second leg. From the first minute at Stamford Bridge, Barca were on the front-foot. “This team is ridiculously good, but the defending from Chelsea has been shocking,” added Carney. Bompastor does not believe the scoreline accurately reflects the gulf between her team and Barcelona. “Barcelona are a really good team but the difference between the teams is not that much,” she added. “One team has been clinical in both games but my team weren’t. ” Does another Champions League exit make Bompastor’s first season a failure? Bompastor said in her post-match news conference that it will still be a good season if Chelsea wrap up the Women’s Super League title and win the FA Cup. Having already secured the League Cup, Chelsea need four points from three games to make absolutely sure of the WSL title, while they face Manchester United at Wembley on 18 May in the FA Cup final. “It will have been a good season [if we win those]. Not ideal or a perfect one,” added Bompastor. Former England goalkeeper Karen Bardsley said it was important to remember how much the French coach has achieved in her first season. “We have to put it into context - this is Bompastor’s first season at a new club, trying to implement her philosophy and identity on a new team,” she told BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra. “She’s got players that she has inherited from Emma Hayes. “I don’t think you can discount what she has been able to do in a relatively short period of time. It’s the standard, the level Chelsea has been accustomed to. “This is just that one empty shelf in that trophy cabinet that is just aching to be filled. “It will be disappointing but I don’t think the season will be a failure because of this. ” Chelsea have never won the Women’s Champions League Bompastor said she knows what is needed for Chelsea to make the next step - and win the Champions League. When pressed on Sunday, she said now was not the time to go into detail and that her focus was on Wednesday’s WSL match when the Blues could win the title at Manchester United. Captain Millie Bright said the defeat was “heartbreaking” and the team was “disheartened” but they could still take positives from it. Asked how they close the gap to Barcelona, she told BBC Sport: “I think we’re there. We’ve still got a lot to learn but you’ve seen from spells in both games we have the quality. “It’s just the technical side and making sure that when we get on top of a side like that we need to punish them. Lessons learned - you just can’t make big mistakes against teams like that. ” Bright added that it was vital the team picked themselves up from Sunday’s crushing disappointment. “There’s still a lot to play for and we’ve had a fantastic season so far but unless you have anything to show for it, it means nothing. ” Carney added: “I’m trying to wrap my head around where Chelsea go from now. Do you keep chasing and buying players or is it a mental or tactical thing? “The gulf shouldn’t be that big. Every individual player put in the effort they wanted to be there, but the gulf is too big and I don’t really understand why. It shouldn’t be 8-2. ” Get the latest WSL news on our dedicated page "

    "title": "Big News: Glow Up is back, and Thunderbolts* hits cinemas - What's coming up this week",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - Here’s what you need to know: This week, BBC Three’s Glow Up returns, with a new set of artists competing to become Britain’s next make-up star. But that’s not all the week has in store. Thunderbolts* hits cinemas, Another Simple Favour starring Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively is coming out, and Samantha Crain drops her new album. Read on for what’s coming up this week… From catwalk-ready looks to gory TV special effects, BBC Three’s Glow Up has seen it all. The reality television show, hosted by model Leomie Anderson, sees aspiring make-up artists compete on various creative briefs and in challenges as they try to impress judges Dominic Skinner and Val Garland. I’ve had a sneak preview of the new series, which starts on Wednesday, and can tell you that the contestants are thrown in at the deep end from the start. Assignments include assisting on the set of HBO fantasy drama series House of The Dragon and working on a music video set with Nova Twins. Val told me the talent this series “really takes makeup to another level”, and said people should “expect the unexpected”. And there’s a career-making prize awaiting the winner: a contract assisting some of the world’s leading make-up artists. It’s a big week for Marvel fans, with Thunderbolts* landing in cinemas on Friday. First reactions on social media have been positive, with many praising actress Florence Pugh for her role as assassin Yelena Belova. Matt Neglia of Next Best Picture calls it “some of Marvel’s darkest material to date”, adding: “It very much belongs to Florence Pugh, who carries much of the dramatic weight of the movie on her back. ” Film writer Mia Pflüger also praised the 29-year-old, writing on X that “the future of the new superhero generation is in good hands with her”. Pugh previously appeared as Yelena in 2021’s Black Widow movie and the Disney+ series Hawkeye. In the new film, her character embarks on a dangerous mission to confront the darkest corners of her past, alongside a team comprising Bucky Barnes, Red Guardian, Ghost, Taskmaster and John Walker. What everyone really wants to know, however, is what the asterisk is all about… On Thursday, black comedy mystery sequel Another Simple Favour is released on Prime Video. It sees Stephanie Smothers (played by Anna Kendrick) and Emily Nelson (Blake Lively) reunite on the island of Capri for Emily’s extravagant wedding to a rich Italian businessman. So far, so good - but alongside the beautiful scenery and glamorous guests, murder and betrayal lie in wait. There have been months of speculation about a feud bubbling between the film’s A-list co-stars but recently, the pair were seen posing and laughing together at the London screening, which went some way to dispelling the rumours. Lively, of Gossip Girl fame, is separately locked in a dispute with her former It Ends With Us co-star Justin Baldoni, with both sides denying allegations made in lawsuits they have filed against each other. By Mark Savage, music correspondent Contentment and creativity are awkward bedfellows. Conflict is a more reliable catalyst for music. Just don’t tell Oklahoma singer-songwriter Samantha Crain, who’s about to release her seventh album, Gumshoe. Full of bewildering beauty and life-affirming anthems, it was written over the last three years, as she unexpectedly fell in love. “I spent much of my life as a lone wolf,” she tells BBC News, “so hyper-independent that it became a defining trait. ” “But as I explored vulnerability and reciprocity in my relationships, I realised… we can change by the minute, and that’s okay. “In my ancestors’ Choctaw language, there are no words for ‘is’ or ‘are,’ reflecting their belief that people, animals, and plants are not permanent or static. That’s the biggest lesson of the past few years: I can be a lone wolf sometimes and still belong to a community. ” That realisation manifests in the lovestruck slacker rock of Dragonfly, and the finger-plucked Neptune Baby, with its refrain, “I’m a boat, and you are the water”. Not that Crain’s relationship was all plain sailing. Her new partner struggles with addiction, and a track called Melatonin finds her listing the items she brought them in rehab – “mint choc-chip ice cream, cigarettes, a watch”. “You got it bad, but you got me,” she reassures. It’s an album of stunning poetic clarity and emotion – typified by the title track, an old-time country-rock ballad inspired by her love of detective novels. “The word ‘Gumshoe’ has been in every writing notebook since I was a teenager,” she says. “After watching The Maltese Falcon, I considered how detached detective characters are and imagined two loners finding love. “Instantly, gumshoe came to mind—the perfect word for a song about unravelling the mystery of relationships. ” "

    "body": "2025/04/27 - Here’s what you need to know: Rugby league-bound Christian Wade scored his 90th Premiership try - moving him level with Mark Cueto in third place in the all-time standings Gallagher Premiership Gloucester (43) 79 Tries: Clement, Blake, Ludlow, Harris, S Atkinson 2, Anscombe, Williams, Ford-Robinson, Wade, Singleton 3 Cons: Carreras 6, Anscombe Exeter (7) 17 Tries: Hodge, Rigg, Haydon-Wood Cons: Slade Gloucester scored 13 tries in a club-record-breaking win over Exeter to move up to fifth in the Premiership. The Cherry and Whites totally outclassed their opponents as they ran in seven first-half tries to lead 43-7 at the break, having earned a bonus point inside the 20 minutes. Jamal Ford-Robinson and Christian Wade took the try tally to nine within 10 minutes of the restart as Exeter began to get embarrassed. The hosts went on to score four more tries - replacement Jack Singleton got a hat-trick - as they registered their record Premiership victory, overtaking a 64-0 win over Bath three years ago. The defeat was Exeter’s heaviest in the top flight, surpassing a 55-12 loss to Sale 14 years ago. It marks the second record-loss for Rob Baxter’s side this season, after a 69-17 defeat by Bordeaux broke their record in European competition. Exeter remain second from bottom of the table. Seb Atkinson helped himself to a pair of tries at Kingsholm Exeter, who had been buoyed by a narrow loss at league leaders Bath last week, were a shadow of that side as the hosts cut through them time and again. Jack Clement was driven over from a sixth-minute five-metre lineout after Gareth Anscombe had set Santi Carreras free. Exeter’s maul defence cost them again eight minutes later as Gloucester’s pack powered into the 22 to earn a penalty and forced Seb Blake over from the resulting close-range lineout. Having seen their forwards master the first two tries, it was the fine passing of the backs that set up the next two. Lewis Ludlow beat Ben Hammersley to a grubber kick for the third after a fine passing move, before Harris went in after Tomos Williams, Christian Wade and Ruan Ackermann linked up to set up the Scotland centre. Exeter’s defence continued to struggle as Seb Atkinson strode through a massive gap 22 metres out to go in under the posts for the fifth try after 26 minutes, and it was just as tepid three minutes later when Anscombe got the sixth. It took 32 minutes for Exeter to get into Gloucester’s red zone as Paul Brown-Bampoe went close before Exeter lost the ball, although a minute later Josh Hodge at least got his side on the scoreboard when he raced in from 22 metres. But once again Exeter’s defence melted as Williams’ lovely looping pass started a move that the Welsh scrum-half got on the end of for the seventh try shortly before half-time. Exeter made five changes five minutes into the second period, but a minute later went further behind when Wade raced on to pick up his own chipped kick and was stopped just short of the Exeter line, only for Ford-Robinson to dot down from an inch or two out a few phases later. Wade edged closer to the all-time Premiership try record when his chipped kick was gathered by Carreras, before the Argentine full-back gave it back for his 90th try in the league, and Atkinson got his second soon after when Carreras shook off a tackle from Brown-Bampoe to race in from distance to make it 60-7. It continued to get embarrassing for the former European champions as Singleton broke off a lineout maul for the 11th try, 18 minutes into the second half, and the replacement hooker dotted down in the corner five minutes later when Gloucester broke the 70-point mark for the first time in a Premiership match. When Exeter did think they had scored a try it was ruled out for a forward pass, as Hodge was denied shortly after Singleton’s second score, with Exeter’s Will Haydon-Wood sin-binned for a tackle off the ball moments later. From the resulting penalty Gloucester kicked out the corner and Singleton was mauled in for his third try to take it to 79-7 with 11 minutes left, before Will Rigg and Haydon-Wood scored two late consolation tries for a shell-shocked Exeter side. Gloucester head coach George Skivington told BBC Radio Gloucester: “It’s obviously a good day for us. The most pleasing thing for me is the balance of the tries was good. “We’ve had a tough couple of weeks away from home and we didn’t feel the balance of our game was quite right. “But I thought today the boys used the maul well, they used the scrum well and when we attacked we looked really good and our defence as very good as well. “Whilst we’re a really good attacking team, we have to have the balance of the game to compete. ” Exeter head coach Rob Hunter told BBC Radio Devon: “In my many years as a coach that is my lowest point. “You can’t put any gloss at all on that. That’s a heavy beating and at this stage it’s a real kick in the teeth. “In no way at all did we have any foothold in that game - nothing really held up and we gave up momentum so easily. “You’ve got to not hide away from it, you’ve got to take responsibility that comes from putting the shirt on, and that will be our first point of call, and then we’ll try and sit through the whys and hows. “Right now it’s important that we wear it and recognise that that is not an acceptable level of performance from anybody involved. ” Gloucester: Carreras; Wade, Harris, S Atkinson, Morris; Anscombe, Williams; Rapava Ruskin, Blake, Fasogbon, Clark, Thomas, Clement, Ludlow (capt), Ackermann Replacements: Singleton, Ford-Robinson, Gotovtsev, Jordan, Clarke, Englefield, C Atkinson, Cotgreave Exeter: Hodge; Hammersley, Slade, Hawkins, Brown-Bampoe; Skinner, Armstrong; Sio, Yeandle, Street, Tuima, Jenkins (capt), E Roots, Vintcent, Fisilau Replacements: Norey, Blose, Iosefa-Scott, Capstick, Vermeulen, Townsend, Haydon-Wood, Rigg Yellow card: Haydon-Wood 68 Referee: Karl Dickson "

    "title": "Update: Chelsea close in on WSL title - when could they win it?",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - It has been recently reported that The WSL season ends on 10 May Chelsea could win their sixth successive Women’s Super League title on Wednesday. They lead Arsenal by six points and Manchester United by eight with three games remaining. Those three sides are well-placed to qualify for Europe, but Manchester City are still in the mix after a win at Leicester on Sunday. The other end of the table is sorted with Crystal Palace relegated on Sunday after their 7-1 thrashing by West Ham. How are things shaping up for the remaining games? Who has the tougher run-in? There have been no signs of teething problems for Chelsea this season under new boss Bompastor, as their league dominance - established under predecessor Emma Hayes - has continued. Unbeaten in the WSL this season, Chelsea have 51 points from a possible 57, although two draws in March allowed closest challengers Arsenal to get within three points and Manchester United within five. The highest total Arsenal could finish with is 54 points, meaning Chelsea need four more to guarantee the title. Because of their Champions League semi-final participation, Chelsea’s WSL game at Manchester United has been rearranged for 30 April. They could clinch the title with victory over United (20:15 BST kick-off) should Arsenal drop points against Aston Villa earlier that evening (18:00). Yet if the Gunners win all of their fixtures, the earliest Chelsea could be crowned champions is in their penultimate game of the season away to Tottenham on 4 May. Manchester City, who challenged Chelsea until the final day last season, are now mathematically out of the title race and only have slim hopes of achieving a Champions League spot. Even if City win all their remaining games - including against their neighbours - one win from United’s other two matches would be enough for them to finish third. From next season, the Women’s Champions League format is changing, with the number of teams earning direct qualification expanding from four teams to nine. The winners of the WSL will directly qualify, along with the champions from the other five top-ranked national associations. The runners-up of the two top-ranked associations - set to be France and Germany - will also be guaranteed direct qualification, along with the previous season’s winners. As it stands, the WSL champions will go directly into the league phase with the teams in second and third going into the qualifying rounds. If Arsenal win the Champions League they would automatically qualify for the league phase as holders. Opta’s ‘supercomputer’ prediction model has Chelsea as nailed-on favourites to lift the WSL trophy - they are projected as champions in 97. 96% of simulations. Arsenal, meanwhile, have been given a sliver of hope, with Opta giving them a 2. 04% chance of winning the title. Manchester City’s bid for European football does not look favourable either, with Cushing’s side predicted to finish outside of the top three in 82. 82% of simulations. Crystal Palace will make an instant return to the Championship after their relegation was confirmed by a home thrashing by West Ham. They have won two games, drawn three but lost 15 in the first season in the top-flight. They are the first team to be relegated in their debut season in the Women’s Super League. “Over a year in football, you get what you deserve and we have to acknowledge we have not been good enough,” said Palace boss Leif Smerud.

    "title": "Update: O'Sullivan & Brecel one frame each from last eight",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - Experts revealed that Ronnie O’Sullivan and Luca Brecel are in opposite halves of the World Championship draw so could only meet in the final Ronnie O’Sullivan and Luca Brecel are both one frame away from making the quarter-finals of the 2025 World Snooker Championship as they hold 12-4 leads over Chinese duo Pang Junxu and Ding Junhui respectively. O’Sullivan, 49, is aiming to become world champion for an eighth time for what would be a record in the modern era, while Brecel lifted the trophy at the Crucible two years ago. Both men will be looking to clinch quick victories when their matches resume at 19:00 BST on Monday. O’Sullivan led 6-2 after the first session, although qualifier Pang pulled two frames back following breaks of 87 and 62. But O’Sullivan quickly regained his form as he won the remaining six frames on Sunday, aided by runs of 79, 80, 105, 135 and 62. Belgian Brecel produced one of the most remarkable sessions at the Crucible on Saturday evening. Having arrived at the venue only 25 minutes before play was due to start after flying on a private jet from his home country, he lost the opening frame before winning seven in a row with a sensational display of attacking snooker. He continued where he had left off on Sunday. Scores of 53, 75 and 56 helped him win four consecutive frames to leave the score at 11-1, although Ding showed good character to take three of the next four, ending with back-to-back centuries of 107 and 110. Elsewhere, world number one Judd Trump holds a 10-6 lead over 2005 world champion Shaun Murphy in a match that saw Trump win Â£100,000 for reaching 100 centuries in a season. All the updates from day nine of the World Championship Trump pockets Â£100,000 prize for 100 centuries ‘Class of 92’ shine on thrilling day at the Crucible Zhao Xintong’s previous best run at the Crucible came in 2022 when he went out in the last 16 China’s Zhao Xintong moved into the quarter-finals for the first time in his career thanks to a 13-10 win over Lei Peifan. Leading 10-6 after the second session, 27-year-old Zhao looked on course for a maximum 147 in the opening frame of the day and potted nine reds and nine blacks before his break ended on 72. He was 41-12 ahead in frame 20, only for Lei to win that and the next two frames as Lei, who beat 2024 world champion Kyren Wilson in round one, threatened a comeback. But a break of 54 saw Zhao clinch victory to set up a quarter-final against England’s Chris Wakelin, a player that has already eliminated 2010 world champion Neil Robertson and former world number one Mark Allen. “I’m so happy, that’s the first time into the quarter-finals and I’m so proud of myself,” he said. “In the first round he [Lei] came back against Kyren Wilson so I knew I wasn’t ready to win and I needed to be strong. “I just want to go through the Crucible and I need to try my best and enjoy it as it is very nice, the crowd is nice and I want to stay longer. This is my first time to play Chris Wakelin, I know he is really good player. ” In June 2023, Zhao, a former UK Championship winner, was one of 10 Chinese players to receive bans for their involvement in match-fixing. He served a 20-month ban and has been the only player to return after he had not directly thrown a match but accepted charges of being a party to another player fixing two matches and betting on matches himself. Zhao is officially classed as an amateur for this tournament, but had already ensured his return to the World Snooker Tour full-time next season. In the day’s other tie, China’s Si Jiahui holds a 9-7 lead over England’s Ben Woollaston, who defeated world number four Mark Selby in the opening round. Si, a semi-finalist two years ago, began the session with a 5-3 lead and the two players alternated the frames as the Chinese player eventually managed to hold on to his two-frame lead. Woollaston made the better breaks of the evening with a 100 in frame 13 and an 85 in frame 15, but Si snatched what could be a crucial 16th frame on the black to gain the advantage. The match will be played to a finish on Monday from 13:00 BST with the winner to face either O’Sullivan or Pang in the quarter-finals. World Championship: Schedule, results &amp; BBC coverage "

    "body": "2025/04/27 - It has been recently reported that The government says it has secured the raw materials needed to keep the British Steel plant at Scunthorpe going “for the coming months” into the summer. Ministers announced 55,000 tonnes of blast furnace coke arrived from Australia at the port of Immingham on Saturday and would be transferred by rail to Scunthorpe. A shipment of more than 66,000 tonnes of iron ore pellets and 27,000 tonnes of iron ore fines is due to arrive from Sweden next week. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds, who led the government in its takeover of the plant, said the steel workers and their families could “breathe a sigh of relief”. The supplies have been paid for by the government using the existing Department for Business and Trade budget. Reynolds said: “By securing the raw materials we need to keep Scunthorpe going for the foreseeable future we’ve helped protect thousands of crucial steel jobs. “Now, British Steel workers and their families can breathe a sigh of relief and know that we are on their side. ” Meanwhile, British Steel has appointed more new executives, including an interim chief operating officer and human resources director, after ministers passed an emergency law to take control of the company from Chinese owner Jingye. Allan Bell, interim chief executive of British Steel, said: “We’ve successfully secured the raw materials we need to keep the blast furnaces running, meaning our production of steel can continue. “We would not be here today without the hard work and dedication of our specialist procurement, technical and operational teams who have worked tirelessly on short timescales to secure the required raw materials. “Over the coming months our focus will be on stabilising our operations for the long-term, cementing British Steel as one of the world’s leading manufacturers of steel. ” Alasdair McDiarmid, the assistant general secretary of the Community Union which represents steelworkers, welcomed the shipments. He said: “The imminent shipments of coke and other raw materials needed to keep the blast furnaces running over the months ahead provide much-needed assurance for our members on site in Scunthorpe. “We are grateful to British Steel and the government for the decisive work they have undertaken to secure a future for the business - we have seen their commitment and dedication first-hand. ” The latest shipment comes after British Steel announced a consultation on redundancies launched in March would be scrapped, saving 2,700 jobs that were put at risk.

    "title": "New: Zverev given warning after photo to dispute ball mark",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - Here’s what you need to know: Zverev was unhappy at the decision Top seed Alexander Zverev was warned for a taking a picture of a contested ball mark at the Madrid Open during more electric line-calling controversy on clay. The world number two overcame Spain’s Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 2-6 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-0) to reach the last 16. But the success was marred by another row as Zverev was convinced a backhand from his opponent in the 10th game of the second set had gone wide. The German told umpire Mohamed Lahyani there was a “malfunction in the system” after it was called in by the electronic system. When Zverev’s appeals came to nothing, he brought his phone out of his bag and took a picture of the mark. The 28-year-old was given a warning for unsportsmanlike conduct, but put the incident behind him to win the second and third sets on a tie-break. Although other surfaces have used the system, clay events had largely persisted with line judges, or the umpire coming down from his or her chair to examine the mark left by the ball, when calls were contested. But this season line judges have been removed from all events on the ATP Tour and many on the WTA Tour. However, the French Open, which begins next month, will also continue with line judges. This was the latest controversial line-call incident after world number one Aryna Sabalenka was also given a warning for taking a photo during a match in Stuttgart earlier this month, while former Grand Slam winner Victoria Azarenka posted an image of a call from another Madrid match on social media. Elsewhere in the Spanish capital, defending champion Andrey Rublev lost 6-4 0-6 6-4 to Alexander Bublik - a defeat which will see the Russian drop out of the world’s top 15. In the women’s draw, top seed Sabalenka recovered from losing the opening set to beat Elise Mertens 3-6 6-2 6-1. But third seed Jessica Pegula and sixth seed Jasmine Paolini were both knocked out. American Pegula was upset 6-3 6-2 by Japan’s Moyuka Uchijima, while Italian Paolini suffered a 6-2 6-1 defeat at the hands of Maria Sakkari of Greece.

    "title": "Big News: Holders Rangers reach Women's Scottish Cup final",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - Experts revealed that Jane Ross (number 13) scored Rangers’ first, third &amp; fourth goals Jane Ross scored a hat-trick as holders Rangers beat Aberdeen 5-0 to set up a Women’s Scottish Cup final meeting with Glasgow City on 25 May. Rangers bettered City’s 4-0 semi-final defeat of Motherwell though it was not quite the commanding performance the score suggested. Rio Hardy and Lizzie Arnot joined Ross on the scoresheet. Rangers applied pressure from the off and, though Aberdeen goalkeeper Annalisa McCann and her defence kept out efforts from Arnot and Katie Wilkinson, the underdogs succumbed after nine minutes. Mia McAulay raced down the right and set up Ross, who opened the scoring from six yards. In a rare foray forward, Aberdeen’s Kerry Beattie then burst down the wing and sent in a fine ball for Francesca Ogilivie. Unfortunately for her, 15-year-old May Cruft - on her second competitive start for Rangers - was there to snuff out any danger. Arnot should have doubled Rangers’ lead on 33 minutes, but showed an uncharacteristic lack of accuracy in front of goal. It was Hardy who netted the second when McCann came out for a long ball, Ross got there first and unselfishly squared for Hardy to roll into an empty net. It was a cruel blow for Aberdeen, who had been defending well and growing into the game. Rangers stretched their lead early in the second period when half-time substitute Brogan Hay headed towards Ross, who controlled with her chest before finishing. As the game wore on, Aberdeen were clearly tiring against their full-time opponents but Eva Thompson did brilliantly to put in a timely tackle just as Cruft was about to unleash a shot. Rangers did add some shine to their performance. Ross wrapped up her hat-trick after pouncing on a rebound when McCann’s save from Arnot fell to the Scotland international almost on the goalline. And Ross turned provider for Arnot at close range in the closing minutes. Aberdeen will take some positives from their first Hampden appearance, as they now look to maintain their top-flight status. Rangers may not have been at their best but are through to their third Scottish Cup final in as many seasons and still have a chance of a domestic treble after sealing the SWPL Cup in March. And they will meet future Hampden opponents City in Wednesday’s SWPL encounter, which is live on BBC Alba, iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app. Rangers trail SWPL leaders Hibernian by two points and are one point in front of City. Rangers head coach Jo Potter: “They made it difficult for us today. Today, it was about getting a job done and getting into a final. A clean sheet was important for us. Some really nice goals from Jane and into a final - job done for us. “It’s not easy to pick a team. There’s a lot of quality. We ask them all to produce and we have a lot of top goal scorers in the squad. Having that competition’s bringing out the best in each other. ” Aberdeen head coach Scott Booth: “It was always going to be a tough game for us. We were able to stick with Rangers pretty well for much of the game, but tiredness crept in. “It was a great experience and if we can take the energy and fighting spirit into the games coming up, we’ll be fine. ” Glasgow City power into Women’s Scottish Cup final "

    "body": "2025/04/27 - According to new developments, Alex Yee finished 14th on his London Marathon debut Olympic triathlon champion Alex Yee says his London Marathon debut was “one of the best experiences” of his life despite suffering more “dark moments” than during his victory at the Paris Games. The 27-year-old finished 14th in the men’s elite race in a time of two hours 11 minutes and eight seconds. Yee, who also became triathlon world champion in October fewer than 12 weeks after his Olympic win, was the second-fastest Briton behind Mahamed Mahamed, who finished ninth. “It was probably one of the best experiences of my life if I’m being honest. I expected the crowd to be good but they were another level,” Yee told BBC Sport. “I am so proud to have completed the marathon. “An amazing experience but it was hard at the end. Emotions about [the] time will come afterwards, but the main thing for me today was to enjoy it, do something unknown and embrace it. I did that to my best of my ability. “This is bigger than running. It’s an amazing day and I wanted to be a part of it. This was the perfect opportunity. ” Asked how running a marathon compared to a triathlon, he added: “My legs have never been this sore. Physically they are quite similar but my legs have never felt like this in my whole life. It’s a new experience definitely. ” Yee confirmed that the switch to the marathon would “definitely not” be a permanent one as he plans to try and defend his Olympic title in Los Angeles in 2028. “Definitely a lot more dark moments, I’d say, than Paris, today,” he said. “Once I got to 32, 33k there’s a lot of pain there. My legs are cramping and I just had to keep fighting through that. ” Assefa sets women’s record as Sawe wins men’s race Debrunner and Hug win London wheelchair races again London Marathon breaks world record for most finishers Eilish McColgan beat Steph Twell’s previous Scottish marathon record of 2:26:40 Eilish McColgan also made her marathon debut after injury had prevented her running in London in previous years. The Commonwealth 10,000m champion secured the highest finish among British runners in the elite women’s race in eighth, and clocked a Scottish marathon record of 2:24:25. In doing so, she also beat the personal best of her mother - 1996 London Marathon winner Liz McColgan - who ran 2:26:52 in 1997. “I was very, very nervous. Probably the most nervous I have been,” the 34-year-old told BBC Sport. “The distance was an unknown. I have never raced more than a half marathon so the thought of doing it back-to-back was scary. The crowds were insane. “I knew my first [marathon] would be tough. I was coming in underprepared. I can now call myself a marathoner which I was incredibly proud of. It was a really good learning experience. “I would love to break two minutes 20 seconds. It is what I think I am capable of doing. I will make some tweaks in training. “There will definitely be more marathons in the future. Hopefully there can another before the end of the year. ” McColgan finished a place above fellow Briton Rose Harvey with Phily Bowden in 11th and Holly Archer 13th. "

    "title": "New: What next for Crystal Palace after WSL relegation?",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - Experts revealed that Twelve months on from the joyous scenes that greeted Crystal Palace winning promotion to the Women’s Super League for the first time, they face the prospect of life back in the Championship. The Eagles were consigned to the second tier after accumulating a total of just nine points so far this season - seven behind Aston Villa and Leicester City - in becoming the first team ever to be relegated in their debut WSL campaign. They have managed two wins and three draws from their 20 WSL games, but Sunday’s brutal 7-1 home defeat by West Ham saw them relegated with two matches left to play. Crystal Palace had never been in the WSL before the 2024-25 season. Before Palace, the only sides to go down the season after they were promoted to the WSL - which introduced relegation in 2014 - were Doncaster Rovers Belles (2016) and Bristol City (2024). Unlike in the Premier League, there are no parachute payments for relegated clubs to help them manage the financial impact of dropping down to the Championship. So what is next for Leif Smerud’s side as BBC Sport takes a look at the fate of the past five relegated teams. Liverpool Women won the Championship in 2022 to return to the WSL Liverpool’s 2020 relegation ended a decade of them being in the WSL. The Covid-19 pandemic resulted in the 2019-20 season being scrapped and the relegated side being determined on a points-by-game basis. There was criticism over a lack of investment and scrutiny of poor facilities following their relegation. However, the Reds would spend only two seasons in the second tier before one of the women’s top-flight founders reclaimed their place among the domestic elite. Vicky Jepson left her role as manager in January of their 2020-21 campaign - they finished third at the end of that season - and Matt Beard returned in the summer amid player unrest. He had previously led the Merseyside club to back-to-back WSL titles, and was part of a revamp of the women’s team that included the appointment of Russ Fraser as their first-ever managing director. Liverpool went on to clinch the Championship title in 2022 by an 11-point margin, with 16 wins from 22 games. Bristol City won the Championship in 2023 to gain promotion back to the WSL Bristol City were relegated from the WSL at the end of 2020-21 under interim manager Matt Beard, who was given the role until the end of the season as maternity cover for Tanya Oxtoby. Lauren Smith, who had previously been an assistant manager, returned to the club to take charge of the Robins. She guided City to third place in the following season behind champions Liverpool, with Abi Harrison - a striker they managed to keep after relegation - the division’s top scorer. They built on that success with seven new signings helping the Robins to their first league title in 2023. Smith has previously spoken about the support and respect she received from her counterpart of Bristol City’s men’s team, Nigel Pearson. Birmingham City finished second in the Championship last season Birmingham City had narrowly avoided relegation two years’ running before their 11-year WSL stint came to an end in 2022 when they were relegated under head coach Darren Carter. That came a year after the squad had sent a letter to the board complaining about conditions for the women’s team. The Blues, another founding member of the WSL in 2010, missed out on the Championship title to Bristol City by one point in 2023, with Carter initially remaining in his role after they dropped down a division. He remained as boss until April 2024, when he was replaced by former Brighton boss Amy Merricks, as they finished fifth and 10 points behind title winners Crystal Palace. Merricks has made an impressive impact - along with substantial investment from the club’s American owners - and Birmingham have gone toe-to-toe this season with big-spending London City Lionesses at the top. Reading Women have endured a steep fall since they were relegated from the WSL Reading’s massive fall wasn’t just due to matters on the pitch, but rather off it. The Royals played the 2023-24 season - their first after relegation to the second tier - and finished 10th, just above the relegation spots. There was a cloud over the Berkshire club for the entirety of this campaign due to the financial difficulties they faced, and the women’s team was withdrawn from the Championship before the 2024-25 season began. Reading have failed to gain promotion from the fifth tier at the first time of asking, finishing two places off the bottom. Bristol City became the first team to have been relegated from the top division on three different occasions since the WSL was formed in 2011 Bristol City endured a miserable return to the top flight, finishing the 2023-24 season with only one win and six points - the lowest from a side in a 22-game WSL season - and nine successive defeats. The inexperienced team were the first promoted side to go straight down from the WSL since Doncaster in 2016. Stephen Kirby was appointed manager of the newly relegated Robins in September 2024, after Lauren Smith stepped down from her role 12 days before the Women’s Championship season kicked off. As well as Smith ending her long association with the club, Lisa Evans, Rachel Furness, Megan Connolly and Carrie Jones were among a host of players to depart. City only added Lexi Lloyd-Smith, Harley Bennett and Jacqueline Burns as permanent signings. The Robins are currently fifth in the league with one game left, missing out on an immediate return to the WSL. Leif Smerud only took charge of the Eagles in March Laura Kaminski led the Eagles to the top flight as champions in 2024, but with the club sitting at the foot of the WSL table in this difficult campaign, she was sacked in February and replaced by Smerud. When the Norwegian took charge, he said: “My mission is quite clear. Short-term, it’s to stay in the league. “But I’m also someone who likes to develop things long-term. Palace has strong values, and that matters to me. ” Whether Smerud stays or the Eagles decide to change their head coach again, clubs who have been relegated previously have not always found it easy to bounce back to the WSL straight away. Teams have struggled financially in the Championship and found it difficult to keep hold of key players. This season has also seen the big-spending owners of London City Lionesses and Newcastle throw their weight behind their teams, making the second tier even more competitive.

    "title": "Breaking: M&S online disruption a 'bruise' to reputation",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - Let’s dive into the details: Marks &amp; Spencer has suffered a “bruise” to its reputation after it was forced to stop taking online orders following a cyber attack, an analyst has said. The retail giant has paused orders on its website and apps since Friday as it attempts to restore operations. But analysts say M&amp;S stands to lose out if the problem is not resolved quickly, with shoppers likely to turn to rival brands when buying summer clothes. Kate Hardcastle, consumer specialist at Insight with Passion, said the incident was “a bruise to M&amp;S’s trusted brand image”. She said: “Customers expect a retailer like M&amp;S to keep their data safe and services running, so an incident like this can shake confidence. ” However, she added that because M&amp;S had responded quickly and been open with its communication the long-term damage should limited. “It’s a setback, but with the right actions it can be just a bruise rather than a lasting scar. ” About a third of the retailer’s clothing and household goods’ sales in the UK come from its online operations. Natalie Berg, retail analyst at NBK Retail, said such incidents “erodes consumer trust in the brand”. “I think shoppers are generally forgiving when these incidents occur, but they expect it to be resolved quickly. ” Customers began reporting problems last weekend - with people struggling to use contactless payments, click &amp; collect, and gift cards - and on Tuesday the retailer confirmed it was facing a “cyber incident”. Then on Friday M&amp;S said it was pausing taking orders through its UK &amp; Ireland websites and apps and some international websites. It apologised for the inconvenience and said it would refund orders placed by customers on Friday. M&amp;S says contactless payments are now working and gift cards can be used. Online grocer Ocado, which sells M&amp;S food on its platform, is unaffected by the problems as it runs on an entirely separate system. With warmer weather due this week, and shoppers turning their thoughts to summer, analysts said M&amp;S could be missing out on sales at a critical time, as people were likely to turn to rival retailers to get what they want. “The turn in weather means shoppers will be thinking about refreshing their wardrobes and homes,” said Ms Berg. “It’s certainly not an ideal time to suspend online orders. ” Catherine Shuttleworth, from Savvy Marketing, said the online impact “is very quick and immediate”. “Given the ‘buy it now’ culture other retailers will benefit from this opportunity. ” M&amp;S’s sales and profits have improved in recent years and it has been seeking to expand its online operations. Last year, out of £3. 9bn of sales in its clothing and home business, nearly £1. 3bn came online. In September, it said increasing the percentage of online sales was “a critical objective”. Ms Berg said problems caused by the cyber attack were “an operational catastrophe”. “M&amp;S is firing on all cylinders today, but there’s no doubt that this is a significant setback”. Last week, a spokesperson from the Information Commissioner’s Office told the BBC it was “assessing the information provided” after the retailer told it about the incident. The firm previously said on Tuesday it had reported the incident to the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), and the National Crime Agency told the BBC it was working with the NCSC to support the firm. The retailer is the latest major brand to experience significant disruption to its online services in recent months. Morrisons faced huge problems with its Christmas orders last year, while Barclays and Lloyds were both hit by banking outages in the first two months of this year. "

    "title": "Breaking: Truro City - From homeless club to league champions",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - Here’s what you need to know: Truro City won the National League title on goal difference from nearest neighbours Torquay United Truro City’s promotion to the National League marks the greatest moment in Cornwall’s footballing history. Known sport-wise as a rugby union hotbed, this county on the South West peninsula is more associated with holidays, cream teas and pasties than high-flying football. But come next season, the Tinners will become the first side from the county to play in the fifth tier of English football, after their dramatic 5-2 final-day win over St Albans City saw them claim the title on goal difference from Torquay United. Their victory comes a year after they were still playing ‘home’ games at Gloucester City - a 390-mile round-trip - and marks the highest of highs for a club that has also seen its fair share of lows. “I cannot believe that we’ve done,” said Truro’s long-serving captain Connor Riley-Lowe. “The club’s had some really tough times over the last few years and especially last year playing in Gloucester three times a week. “We’ve got jobs, we’ve got kids, people don’t realise the amount of effort that we put into it sometimes. “What we’ve done this season is just reward for the last four seasons of having no home and having to graft through. ” Stewart Yetton (left) helped Truro City win the FA Vase in 2007 - the first final played at the ‘new’ Wembley Stadium The most comparable achievement to Saturday’s league title win is probably when Truro won the FA Vase in 2007. Current assistant manager Stewart Yetton - who is the club’s all-time record goalscorer - was part of the side that won at Wembley 18 years ago but says winning the National League South is a much greater achievement. “Wembley was unbelievable, it was amazing the memories that we created that day,” he said. “Winning that is very different to winning the league - we’ve won a league that we had no right to win. “When we went up through the leagues for a few years, we had bigger budgets and we should have done it. We’ve just won a league where we’ve probably got a bottom-six, bottom-seven budget. “This is the greatest achievement that Truro City has ever delivered - Cornwall’s got its first National League club. ” Nomadic Truro City return home after four years The Canadian owner out to follow Reynolds’ lead Few clubs can claim to have had the rollercoaster history of Truro City in the past 20 years. Under former owner Kevin Heaney, they stormed up the regional leagues in the West Country, winning five promotions in six years, and in 2007 were the first side to win a final at the newly-rebuilt Wembley Stadium when they beat AFC Totton 3-1 to win the FA Vase. Under Heaney’s ownership they continued to climb the ranks until they reached what is now National League South in 2011. But as property developer Heaney’s business suffered in the global economic crisis of the time, so did Truro, and the club went into administration in August 2012. They were hours from being expelled from the league before local businessmen Peter Masters and Philip Perryman stepped in and saved the club in October of that year. Thereafter, the team bounced between the Southern League and the National League South, and in 2014, the club’s Treyew Road home was sold to developers. Owner Eric Perez joined in Truro’s celebrations In 2019, Cornish Pirates rugby club took over Truro with the aim of building the Stadium for Cornwall - a venue capable of hosting both sides. After a few planning delays, work began on Treyew Road in October 2020, leaving the club homeless - they groundshared with the likes of Torquay, Plymouth Parkway and even briefly with Gloucester City. After funding issues with the Stadium for Cornwall, Truro went their own way and built their own ground, which opened last August, having been taken over by Canadian investors. But since returning to Cornwall, Truro have flourished - they have the third-highest attendances in the league and have had 3,000-plus sell-outs for their final two matches of the season. “I’ve had a feeling all year that we could do something like this, and to actually do it is a culmination of a lot of hard work from a lot of people and it’s the best feeling in the world,” owner Eric Perez told BBC Sport. “Everything we’ve done since we’ve taken over is to build this club bigger and better and fulfil its potential and fulfil Cornwall’s sporting potential. “So we’re going to do everything we can to do that, nothing will stop us, no-one will stop us and this is for Cornwall. Cornwall deserves it. ” John Askey (left) and assistant Stewart Yetton have guided Truro City to their greatest-ever achievement Comedian Paul Whitehouse once played a Plymouth Argyle fan in a car insurance advert, external - “a long old poke”, he said when describing an away trip to Newcastle. Well for Truro fans - and those of their opponents next season - it will be even longer. Should Gateshead fail to progress through the National League play-offs, it would mean their 920-odd mile round trip to Truro would become the longest away journey in English football - comfortably beating Argyle’s 815-or-so miles to Sunderland and back this season. Next season, Truro’s ‘local’ derby will be a 280-mile round-trip to Yeovil Town - but many of the away days will be more than double that. There could also be lengthy journeys to Hartlepool United, York City, Boston United and Carlisle United, although none are as long as Whitley Bay’s trip to Truro in the FA Vase in 2008 - a round-trip of more than 940 miles. “I’ll probably have to renew my passport and get a visa,” joked manager John Askey. “It would probably be the longest trips in English football that has ever been. “How we’re going to navigate that I don’t know, but we’ll have to sort it out - it’s a nice problem to have. ” But for Askey, it more than vindicates what was seen as one of the most surprising non-league managerial appointment of last summer. The former Port Vale and Shrewsbury Town manager has had great success in the fifth and sixth tiers. He led Macclesfield Town to the National League title in 2018 and guided York City to promotion from National League North in 2022. But he had never managed a club based further south than Shrewsbury and never led a side in National League South - let alone one that had just moved to a new ground and had no idea about how many people would turn out to watch them. So what has been the secret of his success? “I think having honest players is a big thing,” he said. “The things that Truro have to put up with regards the travelling, training facilities, it’s probably the most honest group of players I’ve ever had. They’re amazing. “To have achieved what they’ve achieved, that’s probably why it gives me as much pleasure with this as it as with any promotion that I’ve had. “Whatever club you go to you want to do well because it means a lot to supporters and means a lot to people who were running the football club, and obviously it means a lot to myself to win something. ” Truro City FC "

    "body": "2025/04/27 - It has been recently reported that This video can not be played Eubank narrowly beats bitter foe Benn - highlights Chris Eubank Jr remains in hospital after his victory over Connor Benn but is “doing well”, says his promoter Ben Shalom. Eubank, 35, beat Benn by unanimous decision in a thrilling 12-round middleweight fight at London’s Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Saturday. He was taken to hospital as part of standard procedure for boxers after a gruelling bout. “There is no truth to the rumours regarding a broken jaw,” said Boxxer’s Shalom. “I’m pleased to confirm that Chris is doing well and currently resting. ” Soap opera twists and fatherly love - but what next for Eubank and Benn? Eubank outpoints bitter rival Benn in emotional fight Eubank v Benn - who won each round of grudge match? All three judges scored the contest 116-112 following a bout featuring wild aggression from both fighters, albeit with neither landing the telling blow. Shalom added Eubank was having “precautionary checks to monitor his vitals and ensure everything is in order”. He said: “They take these measures very seriously, given everything they have experienced in the past. ” In 2016, Nick Blackwell suffered a bleed on the skull and was placed in an induced coma after losing to Eubank Jr. He retired but had surgery to reduce swelling on his brain after being injured in a sparring session later that year, before waking from a second coma. Michael Watson suffered brain damage in 1991 in a fight with Chris Eubank Sr. Eubank Sr unexpectedly arrived at the venue alongside his son on Saturday. The pair had supposedly been estranged for years and Eubank Sr had criticised the match-up. Saturday’s bout was set at a middleweight limit of 11st 6lb (160lbs), though Eubank weighed in 0. 05lb over that on Friday. Eubank Sr beat Conor Benn’s father, Nigel Benn, in 1990, before a contentious draw three years later. Shalom added: “Chris and Conor gave absolutely everything in what was the biggest legacy fight of all time. “With their fathers standing proudly behind them, it was a moment that will forever be stamped in sporting history. ” "

    "title": "New: UK to see warmest April weather in seven years",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - Here’s what you need to know: The temperature in southern England could hit 27C (81F) later this week making it the highest temperature recorded in April since 2018. Warmth and sunshine will develop widely across most areas of the UK as high pressure gradually builds. Lack of rainfall however, will again raise concerns about potential wildfires. The last time the temperature rose to 27C in April was in 2018 in Cambridge. Runners of the London and Manchester marathons will likely tell you that it was already warm on Sunday, with the those pounding the streets of the capital experiencing the fourth-warmest London Marathon in its history. The week begins with temperatures across England and Wales already hitting 19-24C, with much of Scotland and Northern Ireland around 16-19C under slightly cloudier conditions. Some patchy rain likely in north-west Scotland, too. However, as sunny skies develop more widely, the combination of strong sunshine and light winds will help temperatures to peak on either Wednesday or Thursday, and be the highest of the year so far in each of the four nations. 23C is the expected high in parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland, 25C in Wales and 27C in England. London, the Home Counties and Cambridgeshire are the areas expected to record the warmest of the conditions. With sea temperatures around the UK still relatively low at the moment, coastal areas where sea breezes develop will feel cooler, but UV levels will remain high. Whilst the upcoming spell of warmth is significant, with a number of areas seeing temperatures 10 degrees above what we’d usually expect, it is not technically going to be a heatwave in meteorological terms. For this, we would need to see at least three consecutive days at or above the “heatwave threshold” which varies depending on where you are in the UK. Do be prepared for high levels of UV, as the sun is as strong this time of year as it is in August. If you’re a hay fever sufferer, another feature of the warm and sunny weather will be an increase in pollen levels. While this will be the warmest weather of the year so far and the warmest since early September, April can bring big swings in temperature and it is not unusual to see this type of hot spell during spring. The highest April temperature ever recorded is 29. 4C which was reached in London on 16 April 1949. As our climate continues to warm though, we expect this type of spring heat to occur more often. Recent analysis found that spring is the fastest-warming season in the United Kingdom. Warm and sunny spells in April are not unusual, but are likely to become more frequent as our climate warms Despite some occasional downpours, spring has been incredibly dry so far this year for a number of areas. In a large swathe of central southern England many have seen only around a fifth of the rainfall they would normally expect to receive since the start of March. For inland areas of North Yorkshire there has been close to a quarter of the normal rainfall which has had an impact on river levels. According to the latest rainfall and river flow summary, external by the Environment Agency, river levels quite widely across the north-eastern quarter of England are classed as “notably low” or “exceptionally low”. Dry and cracked ground in Nottinghamshire after below-average rainfall so far this spring The ongoing dry conditions also mean that fire services across the UK will be on high alert for further wildfires. A study of satellite data by the BBC shows that the area of the UK burnt by wildfires so far this year is already higher than the total for any year in more than a decade. Another potential drawback to the warm, sunny and calm conditions will be the build up of pollutants in the atmosphere. Defra and Met Office air pollution forecasts, external for the week shows moderate pollution levels quite widely across the UK by Wednesday, especially for England and Wales. Area burned by UK wildfires in 2025 already at annual record The role of weather in air pollution With the May Bank Holiday on the horizon I think you may know the answer to this one. Later in the week, as high pressure gradually diminishes a shift in wind direction to the north or north-west will bring cooler air southwards for the start of the weekend. However, while temperatures will drop for all, they will still remain at or above average for the time of the year. At the moment, the start of the weekend looks dry, but there are hints that low pressure could bring showers and cooler conditions by the end of the long weekend. You can find out how the temperatures will vary where you are on the BBC Weather app or by catching up with the latest Weather for the Week Ahead. Jet stream explained.

    "title": "New: First images released of Pope Francis' tomb adorned with single rose",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - According to new developments, Images of Pope Francis’s tomb at the Santa Maria Maggiore church in Rome have been released. A single white rose was pictured lying on the stone tomb that bears the name he was known by during his pontificate, below a crucifix illuminated by a single spotlight. The late pope was laid to rest at the church - one of four major basilicas in the Italian capital, and one he would regularly visit during his time as cardinal and pontiff - in a private ceremony following his public funeral in the Vatican on Saturday. Thousands of mourners have been filing past the tomb since the church opened to the public on Sunday morning to pay their respects to Pope Francis, who died aged 88 on Monday. Among them was Rosario Correale, an Italian, who said it was “very emotional” seeing the tomb. “He really left a mark on us,” he told the Associated Press. Polish pilgrim Maria Brzezinska felt the resting place befit the man. “I feel like it’s exactly in the way of the Pope. He was simple, and so is his place now,” she told the news agency Reuters after visiting. Francis was particularly devoted to the Virgin Mary, and Santa Maria Maggiore was the first church to be dedicated to her when it was built in the 4th Century. The basilica sits near the Colosseum, a stone’s throw from the city’s endlessly bustling and chaotic central Termini station - well beyond the limits of the Vatican, where popes are traditionally entombed. But it was one the South American pontiff had a long-held affinity for. Its senior priest previously told an Italian newspaper that Pope Francis had said he wished to be laid to rest there in 2022, citing inspiration from the Virgin Mary. “I thought it was amazing that he wanted to be buried here in this basilica,” Amaya Morris, another pilgrim, told AP. “Out of all of the [churches], he chose this one. So I thought that was really amazing. It’s really humbling to be able to be here. ” Francis’s funeral was attended by heads of state, heads of government and monarchs from around the world - as well as hundreds of thousands of Catholics who lined the streets leading to the Vatican to pay their respects. Hymns played out on giant speakers, occasionally drowned out by the sound of helicopters flying overhead, before 91-year-old Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re gave a homily on the pope’s legacy. The cardinal emphasised that Pope Francis had repeatedly urged the world to “build bridges, not walls”. The funeral was also the venue for a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky, which the latter said afterwards had the “potential to become historic”. Trump later questioned Russian President Vladimir Putin’s willingness to end the now three-year war in Ukraine, a conflict which Pope Francis had regularly called for peace during his papacy. Following the public funeral, Pope Francis’s coffin was carried through Rome in a slow procession. Authorities said 140,000 people had lined the streets, clapping and waving as the hearse - a repurposed white popemobile - crossed the Tiber river and drove past some of Rome’s most recognisable sights: the Colosseum, the Forum and the Altare della Patria national monument on Piazza Venezia. After a period of mourning, attention will soon turn to the selection of the next pope. A date has not yet been set but it is thought it could start as early as 5 or 6 May, with 135 cardinals set to attend, making it the largest conclave in modern history. "

Olympic silver medallist Assefa burst clear of 2021 winner Joyciline Jepkosgei of Kenya with 10km to go before crossing the line in two hours 15 minutes 50 seconds. Assefa beat the previous record, set by Peres Jepchirchir of Kenya in London last year, by 26 seconds. Jepkosgei finished second, nearly three minutes behind, with 2023 winner and Olympic champion Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands third. In the men’s race, debutant Sawe kicked on with a little over 10km (6. 21 miles) remaining and his rivals were unable to respond, with the Kenyan finishing in 2:02:27. Half marathon world record holder Jacob Kiplimo of Uganda was over a minute down in second on his full marathon debut and 2024 winner Alexander Mutiso Munyao came third. Great Britain’s Mahamed Mahamed finished ninth, with Olympic triathlon champion Alex Yee in 14th.

The pair were among the lead group early on but by the 20km (12. 5-mile) mark, Hassan was five seconds back with Assefa and Jepkosgei maintaining a relentless pace. It looked set for a close finish but Assefa, the former outright world record holder, kicked for the line and from being neck-and-neck with Jepkosgei at 35km (just under 22 miles), she was 56 seconds ahead at 40km and held treble that advantage by the line. “I won second here last year so to win this year is very special. I am really, very happy,” Assefa told BBC One. “Last year I did have some problems with the cold and my hamstring tightened up towards the end. This year the weather suited me better. “I am really pleased with how the race went. ” The field for the men’s elite race was touted as the best ever in London and the lead group was still comprised of nine athletes after 30km (18. 64 miles). Sawe made his move just after the 31km (19. 26 miles) mark and although the competition included Kiplimo, Mutiso, four-time winner Eliud Kipchoge and Olympic champion Tamirat Tola, none could match him. The Kenyan stretched his lead and eventually crossed the line a minute and 10 seconds ahead of his nearest challengers. “I am so happy. This is my fastest time for the London Marathon,” he told BBC One. “I was well prepared for this race and that is why it is an honour for me to have won. ” What is Couch to 5k and how do I start?

There’s been injuries, there’s been shiny new signings, there’s been lots of time spent on the bench and rumours that he might be on his way out, but he’s still fighting. In the past five seasons his league starts have been in single figures, but he’s kept going. He’s started 20-plus league games in only five of his 13 completed seasons, but his influence has been important. He has these purple patches that have proven irresistible to managers. Celtic have too much class for everybody else in this league, but Forrest is the living embodiment of their grit. He’s their most decorated son in terms of numbers of trophies, but there’s dog in him, too. You don’t see it in his personality, but it has to be there. He’s scored in 15 straight seasons and how his team-mates must want him to make it 16, particularly Callum McGregor, who has been around for an age himself and knows precisely what it is that Forrest has achieved. “The season before he made his debut I had him in the development team,” says his first Celtic manager, Neil Lennon. “He was a standout player. “He had everything. Brilliant technique with both feet. You could play him left, right, you could play him through the middle. He had that great change of speed. He was electric - one of those players that get you off your seat, even at that age. “Going past people. Low centre of gravity. Not afraid of anything. From when I first saw him play, I loved him. ” No-one - the humble Forrest chief among them - is going to claim that anybody from this era can hold a candle to those from Lennox’s peerless time, but it was a special moment at Tannadice on Saturday. There was no pomp and circumstance about him. No social media postings, no drawing attention to himself. There was what there’s always been - honesty, graft, pride. For Brendan Rodgers, he’s been one of the few constants across both of his spells - himself and McGregor. Standard setters in their own ways. “Jamesie is very, very quiet, but his leadership comes in what he does, how he carries himself,” says Lennon, “He’s a manager’s dream. ” This video can not be played Watch Celtic’s title celebrations When did this all begin? A few minutes from the end of a league game against Motherwell on a Saturday in May, 2010 - 14 years and 361 days ago - Forrest got on the end of a flick-on from Marc-Antoine Fortune and planted a left-foot shot into John Ruddy’s net. For the 18-year-old, it was a debut to remember. Nine minutes, one goal. Looking back at the footage, what stands out is Forrest’s youth - he could be mistaken for a 12-year-old. There’s also the names of some of his bygone team-mates - Edson Braafheid, Zheng Zhi, Morten Rasmussen, Josh Thompson. Relics from another age There’s something else about that scene that reminds you of how long Forrest has been on the road, though. The attendance at Celtic Park that day was 24,000. The club, as much as the player, has come a long way. There was no trophy in that season, 2009-10, Rangers having won their second title in a row not long before. There wasn’t even a cup final. Hearts put them out of the League Cup and Ross County the Scottish Cup. Celtic played 10 games in Europe and won two. Tony Mowbray lost his job along the way. Lennon was appointed manager in a bid to bring back the thunder. “Look at his career and it’s been so successful, but there’s been tremendous lows as well,” adds Lennon. “Missing out on big games through injury or not being selected. He’s had his lows, but he’s just kept himself on an even keel. Nothing fazes him. “He’s not one to kick the doors in when he’s not in the team. Some players don’t accept that, but he seems to be like, ‘okay, this is my role at the minute, but when I’m called upon, I’ll be ready’. And he’s always ready. “And I still really enjoy watching him play. He’s still one of the most exciting players to watch when he’s in full flow. As the game has evolved, he’s evolved with it. He’s a sort of passing winger now, but still with a goal threat. “I don’t put him on a pedestal with Bobby Lennox or any of the Lisbon Lions, but he’s definitely a man who has done great things in his own right. ” At 33, and soon-to-be 34, there’s still no sign of him being sated by all the success, which is probably the very characteristic that has put him in the history books. On title-winning day he edged one past a great Lion of 1967. Next month, when the Scottish Cup final swings around, he’ll be short odds to move two clear. Still hungry, still winning. For the evergreen Forrest, age seems utterly irrelevant. "

    "body": "2025/04/27 - According to new developments, This video can not be played Watch: Four sent-off after post-match brawl The Northern Ireland Football League has condemned the mass brawl which marred Larne and Glentoran’s Irish Premiership match at Inver Park on Saturday. Players and officials from both clubs became involved in unsavoury scenes across the pitch following full-time as a scoreless draw gave Larne the point they needed to secure European qualification. Larne’s Aaron Donnelly and Conor McKendry, and Fuad Sule and Christie Pattison of Glentoran, were all sent off by referee Jamie Robinson. “We are aware of and totally condemn the incidents following the Larne - Glentoran game on Saturday evening,” a NIFL spokesman said on Sunday. “NIFL staff have been in contact with the match referee and the match observer to offer support, and we will await their respective official reports. “We will work with the IFA Disciplinary Committee to make sure they have all the necessary information on this matter. ” The Irish FA said: “We are aware of the matter and, should it be formally referred to the Disciplinary Committee, normal disciplinary protocols will be followed in line with established procedures. ” ‘It was really unsavoury’ - Haveron on mass brawl ‘You shouldn’t lift your hands on a football pitch’ - Devine This video can not be played “No room for fighting” - Glens boss Declan Devine on Inver Park brawl Speaking after the game, Glentoran boss Declan Devine said he “didn’t see much” of the melee. “My players stood up for each other on and off the pitch. I’d be more frustrated if my players lay down and took punches,” he told BBC Sport NI. “I’m extremely proud of the players, I want fight and commitment, maybe not to the level after the game, but it takes two to tango. “There are certain players in our changing room who are frustrated with certain members of the Larne team instigating fights. ” Larne manager Gary Haveron described the scenes as “really unsavoury”. “It is not something you want to see at games,” said Haveron. “We pride ourselves on being a family club, there are a lot of kids in the stand and that is not how you end the game of football, but when someone comes on and attacks one of your team-mates it is only natural you are going to react to it and that Glentoran would react to that. ” Having reviewed the footage, Haveron added: “You have to say to the boys to step back because it drags on and on but there was an antagonist. “People will get punished and rightfully so, I hope the antagonist is punished the most. ” "

    "title": "Update: Rudiger apologises for throwing object at referee",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - Experts revealed that Antonio Rudiger had to be held back by Real coaching staff after being sent off Antonio Rudiger has apologised after being sent off for throwing an object at the referee during Real Madrid’s Copa del Rey final defeat by Barcelona. Rudiger and Real team-mate Lucas Vazquez, who had both been substituted, were shown straight red cards for angrily reacting to a foul given against Kylian Mbappe shortly before the final whistle. Real’s England midfielder Jude Bellingham, 21, was also later sent off for dissent. Referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea said in his report that centre-back Rudiger, 32, was dismissed for “throwing an object from the technical area, which missed me”. Rudiger reportedly threw an ice cube at the official. , external “There’s definitely no excuse for my behaviour,” Rudiger posted on an Instagram story. “I’m very sorry for that. “Sorry again to the referee and to everyone I have disappointed. ” The Germany defender could be facing a lengthy ban, according to the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) disciplinary code. If sanctioned under article 101, which covers “mild violence” towards referees, Rudiger could receive a suspension of between four and 12 matches. However, if his actions are deemed more serious, article 104, which covers “assault against referees”, states players may be banned for three to six months if “the act was a single act and did not cause any harmful consequences”. If the act is deemed as having posed a “serious risk” even without the referee requiring medical attention, the suspension could extend to between six months and a year. Kounde wins Clasico Copa del Rey final for Barcelona Why Barcelona v Real Madrid won’t just define trophies, but trajectories Real Madrid dismiss cup final fears after referee’s tears Lucas Vazquez was dismissed after entering the pitch to complain about a decision Real Madrid had come from behind to lead 2-1 before Ferran Torres’ 84th-minute equaliser sent the Clasico final in Seville to extra time. Barcelona defender Jules Kounde drilled in a 22-yard screamer in the 116th minute to ultimately win a thrilling encounter on Saturday. In the final moments, Real forward Mbappe tried to shrug off Eric Garcia and drive into the penalty area but was penalised for a foul on the Barcelona defender. The Real bench reacted furiously, with Rudiger appearing to throw an object at De Burgos Bengoetxea, for which he was dismissed, before having to also be restrained by members of the Real coaching staff. Vazquez, 33, was sent off for entering the field of play and protesting against the decision. “You can see something is thrown - [Rudiger] is in big trouble, it doesn’t miss the referee by a million miles, it’s at the referee,” said Premier Sports commentator Terry Gibson. “It’s pathetic from the Real Madrid players. ” Rudiger said the fact he had been substituted and therefore “not able to help” his team led to the “mistake” before the final whistle. The referee report states Bellingham was later sent off for approaching the officials in an “aggressive attitude” and “having to be restrained by his team-mates”. Video footage of the tunnel at half-time appears to show Bellingham say: “Everything goes in their favour. Every 50-50 decision goes in their favour” - though he was not sanctioned for this comment. It is the second time Bellingham has been sent off for Real this season for dissent. He was given a two-match ban for swearing at the referee in a 1-1 La Liga draw with Osasuna in Februrary. There were tensions between Real Madrid and De Burgos Bengoetxea in the build-up to the match. The referee broke down in tears in a news conference over the pressure the club’s TV channel has put officials under, prompting an angry response by Real. In February, Real Madrid wrote a formal letter of complaint to RFEF and Spain’s High Council for Sports saying Spanish refereeing was “rigged” and “completely discredited”. After that letter, which followed a 1-0 loss to Espanyol, La Liga president Javier Tebas said Real Madrid had “lost their head”. Later that month the RFEF condemned the “repulsive” abuse suffered by referee Jose Luis Munuera Montero for sending off Bellingham against Osasuna. Earlier this month, Rudiger and Mbappe were given suspended one-match bans and fined for indecent conduct during their Champions League last-16 win against Atletico Madrid, with Dani Ceballos also fined.

    "title": "Update: Where did it go wrong and is McGlynn next for Hearts?",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - Experts revealed that This video can not be played Watch Critchley’s last interview as Hearts head coach Neil Critchley was a surprise appointment to rescue Hearts’ season. “Never a Hearts manager,” according to Sportscene pundit and former Tynecastle player Michael Stewart. And so, after six months and 35 matches in all competitions, it’s over. The Englishman, 46, extracted the Edinburgh side from relegation danger, but failed to reach the top six. And, after defeat by Dundee, the spectre of demotion through the play-offs has flitted back into view. It was that which ultimately led to Critchley being told on Saturday evening that his time was up. BBC Sport’s Scotland’s Brian McLauchlin, who covers Hearts every week, picks through the debris and looks at what might happen now. Critchley sacked by Hearts after six months Hapless Hearts beaten at home by Dundee Visit our Hearts page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views When Critchley was appointed in October, many Hearts fans had never heard of the former Liverpool youth coach. Sure, he had managed Queens Park Rangers and Blackpool (on two separate occasions) but remained pretty much an unknown quantity. Chief executive officer Andrew McKinlay refuted suggestions Critchley was the club’s second choice because talks had broken down with former Norway boss Per-Mathias Hogmo. And two wins in his opening games appeared to show the Hearts board - or data partner Jamestown Analytics, who were heavily involved in the decision - had identified the right man. However, just three victories against the Premiership’s bottom two teams in the next 14 matches followed. Included in this run was a wretched performance against Moldovan minnows Petrocub at Tynecastle when a victory would have ensured European football would continue after Christmas. Other big-game setbacks came against Celtic, Rangers and local rivals Hibernian, who resurrected their season after a similar dismal start to their campaign. Critchley wasn’t helped by long-term injuries to key players, such as Frankie Kent, Stephen Kingsley and Craig Halkett. And when you add in the dip in form of striker Lawrence Shankland, the football gods were never really in his favour. However, he will accept that football is a results industry and those results were simply not there for him. Hearts v Dundee highlights 26/04/25 McKinlay and recently-appointed director of football Graeme Jones were at the forefront of the decision to remove Critchley. Liam Fox, who took interim charge when Steven Naismith was dismissed in the autumn, will again take the helm but is unlikely to have enough support or experience to be considered on a long-term basis. Jamestown Analytics will once again no doubt play a role in finding a new head coach/manager, so there are likely to be names mentioned once again who are alien to many of the club’s supporters. One name they will definitely know and is highly likely to be close to the top of their wish list is John McGlynn. The 63-year-old has been in charge of the club before and is close to leading Falkirk back to the Scottish Premiership with consecutive promotions, even if they have stumbled in their past two matches. McGlynn knows Hearts inside out and is keenly aware of what is required to be successful at Tynecastle. He will have his backers within the club without doubt. Other notable names to be mentioned will be Kilmarnock’s Derek McInnes and Stephen Robinson of St Mirren, who have been linked with the job in the past. Regardless, whoever comes in will have to work with, and believe in, the use of analytics when it comes to recruitment. This is a crucial time for Hearts. They have one of the biggest fanbases in Scotland and have had millions of pounds invested by the Foundation of Hearts and rich benefactors, but somehow they still cannot get things right. Chair Ann Budge relinquished much of the control to McKinlay, with many fans now questioning if he should remain at the club in his current position. The immediate aim for Hearts will be to ensure they remain a top-flight club as they are currently just five points clear of their next opponents Ross County, who sit in the relegation play-off spot. Dingwall on Saturday could be nervy. The players also need to show more than they have done of late. Against Dundee, Hearts had more than 70% possession but rarely gave Trevor Carson in the visitors’ goal much to worry about. The club hold their annual player of the year awards on Sunday but much of the talk will be around who is next for the Tynecastle hotseat. Allan: A knee-jerk reaction to deflect by an inept board who have got it wrong season after season. Jurgen Klopp would have struggled under these circumstances never mind Neil Critchley. Robert: Critchley is unfortunate to lose his job before the season’s end, but he hasn’t done enough to suggest that he’s prime management material. The suggestion that John McGlynn may be a serious contender to be his successor is, frankly, laughable. He’s been there, done that, and he’s too old. Nick: It is the easy option to sack the manager but once in a while take a look at the players and weed out the non-achievers, also what about the director of football? They seem to always miss the bullets. Alfred: The chief executive should bear the responsibility of appointing Steven Naismith and Neil Critchley and resign himself. Robert: Just not good enough, so it’s for the best he goes now and we try a complete rebuild. David: Critchley was out his depth as much as the Hearts board are out their depth with regards to any football decisions. Changing the manager again doesn’t deal with the core issue. Steve: Failed to get us into the top six. Failed to get us to the cup final and was dragging us into a relegation battle. Clueless. Correct decision. Fraser: Hearts haven’t been good enough for years. Another under-par manager in thrust into the spotlight. The next appointment needs to be a huge name that has proven themselves in the game and has the ability to attract high performing players to Hearts. "

    "title": "Update: River v Boca - inside the world's fiercest rivalry",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - Experts revealed that River’s Franco Mastantuono and Boca’s Edinson Cavani will likely play key roles on Sunday When it comes to football derbies, very little comes close to matching the passion, intensity and cultural significance of Argentina’s Superclasico between River Plate and Boca Juniors. Superstar players, fanatical fans, regular helpings of drama and the sinister side of the game - the Superclasico has it all. On Sunday, River’s 85,000-capacity Mas Monumental stadium will host the 264th Superclasico on matchday 15 of the Torneo Apertura, the first half of the Argentine top-flight season. Boca are looking to avenge a 1-0 home defeat in September and clinch top spot in Apertura Zone A, while River need to build momentum before the knockout rounds after a mixed start to the season. Whatever the outcome, it promises to be some spectacle. Not only are River and Boca local rivals in Buenos Aires, they are the two biggest clubs in Argentina and indeed two of the superpowers in South America. As many as 80% of Argentines support one of the two clubs. Their trophy cabinets match their popularity. River have 38 top-flight titles and four Copas Libertadores to their name, while Boca have won the league title on 35 occasions and the Libertadores on six, with three of those triumphs coming during a golden age between 2000 and 2003. Both have also counted some of the greatest players of all time among their ranks. River alumni include Alfredo di Stefano, Enzo Francescoli and Daniel Passarella, while Boca fans have worshipped Carlos Tevez, Juan Roman Riquelme and Diego Maradona. There is naturally a lot at stake on derby day - Boca fans take great pride in the fact they lead River 92 wins to 87 in the overall Superclasico record. But the rivalry goes way beyond 90 minutes on a football pitch. “It is rooted in their origins, or rather their respective foundational myths,” Argentine football journalist Santi Bauza tells BBC Sport. The close geographical proximity of the clubs when they were founded - River in 1901 and Boca four years later - created tension. One fan is said to have burned the flag of the opposition during one early meeting, while a Superclasico in 1931 was abandoned after 31 minutes because of mass fighting. The schism widened when River Plate - after joining their rivals in the working-class neighbourhood of La Boca - relocated to the well-to-do suburb of Recoleta up the road, then further north to Nunez, where they reside today. Deserting their working-class home and spending big on players - the 35,000 pesos (Â£1,350) fee paid for Bernabe Ferreyra in 1932 set an Argentine transfer record that stood for 20 years - led to River becoming known as ‘Los Millonarios’. The Millionaires. By contrast, Boca have always remained in their spiritual home, the famous La Bombonera stadium that is seemingly dropped into the middle of the ‘barrio’, a high-poverty district of the city. Their Italian immigrant, working-class roots are a central part of their identity. Little shows this more than the club’s nickname ‘Xeneize’, which comes from the Ligurian dialect word for Genoese. A Superclasico without some sort of scuffle does not feel like a Superclasico The division between the clubs is reflected on the pitch in both playing styles and full-blooded encounters. “River have traditionally favoured a more aesthetic brand of football, with their more demanding fans barely even celebrating hard-fought or undeserved wins,” explains Bauza. River fans often speak of the three Gs - Gustar (to play well), Ganar (to win) and Golear (to score lots of goals). “Our club is known for its beautiful style of play, excellent ball control, an attacking mindset, and a philosophy that sees attacking the opposition’s goal as the best form of defence,” River club president Jorge Brito tells BBC Sport. That mentality is juxtaposed by the popular Boca motto ‘transpira a la camiseta’, which means to ‘make the shirt sweat’. Passion and fight are non-negotiable. “Boca pride themselves in being a win-at-all-costs kind of side,” says Bauza. “Over the years they have both become so massive and ubiquitous in Argentine society that the rich-poor narrative doesn’t hold up as much now, but they are still largely identified by those footballing philosophies. ” Insult culture in Argentina has given rise to some incredibly petty nicknames. Since throwing away a half-time lead to lose to Penarol in the 1966 Copa Libertadores final, Boca fans have called River ‘Gallinas’ - ‘little chickens’. In a 2004 Superclasico, Boca striker Carlos Tevez was sent off for performing a chicken dance in celebration. Boca are known as ‘Los Bosteros’ - ‘the manure handlers’ - as a factory that used horse manure to make bricks once stood behind La Bombonera. Opposition players have been known to hold their noses when entering the pitch. Boca’s La Bombonera stadium often shakes during matches Argentina is obsessed with football, so it is no surprise that meetings between its two biggest clubs are seismic events. “The Superclasico stops the country in its tracks,” says Bauza. “Regardless of their form or success, it’s always a game that defines the mood of players, managers, pundits and fans alike. “Storylines can emerge or change overnight depending on what happens. ” One of the main highlights of the Superclasico is actually what happens in the stands rather than on the pitch. Giant tifos and choreographed displays are common, singing is non-stop and the atmosphere is spine-tingling. But there is a dark side to the world’s most intense derby. The Barras Brava - a gang-like organised fan group - rule the terraces in Argentina and have huge influence over club issues like ticketing, merchandising and car parking. River Plate’s Mas Monumental stadium can accommodate 85,000 people after expansion Although they bring the noise and passion that makes Argentine football so special, their intrinsic links to organised crime, violence and homicide can make stadiums dangerous places. When River were relegated to the second division in 2011 for the first time in their history, the players were locked inside the dressing room for three hours while fans rioted and burned parts of El Monumental. In 2015 Boca were thrown out of the Libertadores when the River squad were sprayed with pepper spray when emerging for the second half. The second leg of the 2018 Libertadores final - the highest-profile game in Superclasico history - was postponed after police tear gas, used to disperse River fans who had smashed windows on the Boca bus with projectiles as it sped towards Mas Monumental, affected the visiting players. The competition - named after those who liberated South America from Spanish rule - was concluded in Madrid. While River are assured of a place in the last 16 of the Apertura and top their Libertadores group, a mixture of pre-season squad upheaval and injuries have contributed to an inconsistent start to the year. But beat Boca on Sunday and everything will look a lot rosier. “It is always special. This game is the one you wait for, and nothing else matters when it comes to how it feels to win or lose against them,” says journalist and River fan Andres Bruckner. While Boca have had a week to prepare, River flew more than six hours to Ecuador for a 2-2 draw with Independiente del Valle in the Libertadores on Wednesday. “I always think we will win, but playing Libertadores midweek makes things tricky,” says Bruckner. “In moments like these, with so many doubts, a defeat would put a great question mark over all the players, and supporters will show anger. ” With 85,000 fans now able to cram into the recently expanded Mas Monumental, the pressure to win has never been greater. “I wouldn’t mind losing five games in a row if we get the win on Sunday,” admits broadcaster and River fan Juan Igal. “Boca is the thing I hate the most, and seeing the sadness in their fans and players makes me happy. ” River Plate won the most recent Superclasico, a 1-0 victory at Boca’s La Bombonera in September With many of the players responsible for River’s success in recent years now moved on - the sales of Julian Alvarez and Claudio Echeverri to Manchester City typify the struggle of Argentine clubs to retain their best young talent - manager Marcelo Gallardo has placed a lot of faith in 17-year-old starlet Franco Mastantuono. Boca started the season poorly - they won just one of their opening four Apertura games and were eliminated in the Libertadores qualifiers - but nine wins in their last 10 league games have sent them three points clear at the top of the table. Carlos Palacios and Kevin Zenon have stood out for Boca this season, while the likes of Edinson Cavani and Luis Advincula provide experience and relative calm. “Boca fans die for every game, but we live for Copa Libertadores nights and Superclasicos. It’s a game unlike any other,” says Rodrigo Azurmendi, Boca fan and co-host of the Boca in English Podcast. “Winning means going all out on the jokes, the memes and the folklore against our friends on the other side. Losing means skipping work on Monday. ” For some, the idea of defeat on Sunday is too much to bear. “I can’t think about losing, I just don’t have it in me,” Boca fan Rob Smith says.

    "title": "New: Soap opera twists and fatherly love - but what next for Eubank and Benn?",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - Let’s dive into the details: This video can not be played Eubank narrowly beats bitter foe Benn - highlights When the camera panned to a grinning Chris Eubank Sr stepping out of a black car, you half expected the Eastenders duff-duffs to swiftly follow. His arrival for his son’s bout with Conor Benn on Saturday night was a scene worthy of any soap opera plot twist. In a sport of fine margins, the reconciliation may just have given his son, Chris Eubank Jr - who said before the fight he had not spoken to his father for years - the edge over Conor Benn in a rivalry steeped in history and drama. After 12 gruelling back-and-forth rounds at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, the usually composed Eubank fell to his knees when his name was read out as the winner. Benn welled up, tears masked by a stone-faced expression as he battled the disappointment. Anyone who has even loosely followed boxing these past two years will be acutely aware how badly both men wanted the win. It all began with a clash of personalities and a bloodline feud inherited from their fathers’ iconic duel in the 1990s. The rivalry was blasted to heights higher than Katy Perry’s recent brief space jaunt after Benn failed a drugs test, which led to the cancellation of their scheduled 2022 bout. And it ended with both men, rather fittingly, in the arms of their legendary fathers. As an emotional Benn took his defeat with humility, he also struck at what has been at the heart of a fight that captivated a nation. “A relationship with your father is special, I’d pick a relationship with my dad over boxing any day,” Benn said. “If this fight brought Chris and his dad together then that’s worth its weight in gold. ” In the moment, it’s all too easy to rave about the spectacle and exceeded expectations. But is a rematch the best move for the fighters and British boxing? Or after a two-year doping scandal, unnecessary egg slap and a criticised weight agreement, should we move on from this family feud? This video can not be played Relationship with dad more important than boxing - Benn Eubank v Benn - who won each round of grudge match? Ferocious Eubank v Benn fight in pictures ‘Legendary behaviour’ - Relive Eubank’s win over Benn Eubank Sr beat Nigel Benn in 1990 before a contentious draw three years later. But their sons were so far away in weight and experience that, on paper, they never should have shared a ring. The smaller Benn had operated most of his career at welterweight, whereas former world-title challenger Eubank was a seasoned pro up at middleweight and super-middleweight. Such was the demand for the match-up, though, a carefully constructed environment was created to make the fight make sense. This is not uncommon in the world of boxing, see Jake Paul v Mike Tyson for further reference. A rehydration clause limited Eubank from adding more than 10lb on the morning of fight night. Benn was approved to use firmer horsehair gloves instead of foam padding and an 18ft ring was used instead of the standard 20ft - both of which suited his explosive style. Eubank was a fighter who, at the back end of his career, struggled to make the 11st 6lb weight limit. The clip of him in a sweatsuit - in discomfort and pain - trying to shed whatever fat was left on his body was a sorry sight for the sport. But promoter Hearn feels too much was made of Eubank’s weight cut. “He has made it the last five times but he just messed up, that’s it,” Hearn said at the post-fight news conference. “Apart from his dad, no-one ever said ‘do you think it’s dangerous for Benn to be moving up two divisions and fighting someone the size of Eubank?’” But regardless of whether you feel Benn or Eubank was at the bigger disadvantage, if so many conditions needed to be met to create a level playing field, should they have been fighting each other in the first place? Eubank appeared affected by the weight cut during the fight and struggled to keep pace with Benn early on Benn, who denies intentional doping and was cleared to fight by an anti-doping panel, may never win over the critics - those who feel there are still unanswered questions about the failed tests. Yet some boxing fans - not necessarily the purists - can be forgiving, especially when you put it all on the line. Judging by the jeers turned into cheers, Benn left north London having converted a few haters into fans. He came close to causing the upset. There is some merit to him saying he could have beaten Eubank had he been more active. Benn has missed out on key learning years and fights over the past two and half years. So where does he go from here? “If it was as close as people are saying it is, then that’s what is painful because I wasn’t outclassed or hurt in there,” Ben said. “Do I avenge the loss, or drop down [to welterweight] and win the WBC world title? If [Mario] Barrios is watching, I’d love that. ” Eubank has gone some way in transforming his public image in the build-up. His emotional vulnerability in opening up about his fractured relationship with his father and the death of his brother in 2021 has softened his ‘bad guy’ persona. Eubank has also won over some of his peers, too. He took a hit from his own pocket to compensate those fighters who were supposed to feature on the undercard of his cancelled 2022 fight with Benn. It was a shrewd PR move from Eubank but also highlighted the disparity between main eventers and those who are not earning life-changing money. But for all his good deeds, Eubank had to perform on the night. It was tougher than expected, but he did enough. He has been linked to a bout with Mexican superstar Saul ‘Canelo’ Alvarez in 2026. There will be an easier route to a world title, should he wish. Whichever direction Eubank and Benn go in now, we must keep in mind how and why we got here. Without the monocle-wearing, truck-driving Eubank Sr and British Army soldier turned Dark Destroyer Nigel Benn, there would be no 65,000 fans at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. While Eubank Jr and Benn have carved out their own careers, they are also two fighters reaping the rich fruits of nepotism.

    "body": "2025/04/27 - Experts revealed that Machado Garry’s win against Prates was the 16th of his career Ian Machado Garry survived a late blitz from Carlos Prates to triumph by unanimous decision at UFC Fight Night in Kansas City, Missouri. After controlling the majority of the fight, Ireland’s Machado Garry was hurt by some ground shots from the Brazilian but held on to the final bell in a tense finish. It was a welcome victory for Machado Garry after his defeat by Shavkat Rakhmonov in December while it was Prates’ first loss in the UFC. “I wasn’t hurt enough to not know where I was, I was conscious in every moment. I know how dangerous that man is, I have nothing but respect for him,” said Machado Garry. “That man hits like a truck. He’s been on a tear but I told everyone what I was going to do - outclass him - and I believe I did that. ” The 27-year-old, as he did against Rakhmonov, took the Prates fight at the start of the month at short notice. Machado Garry was seeking to bounce back from the first defeat of his nine-fight UFC career and had targeted outclassing the 31-year-old over five rounds - and that is largely what he did. Machado Garry received boos during his walkout in contrast to the popular Prates, who has become a fan favourite with four knockouts in his first four bouts. After a tentative opening few minutes, Machado Garry took advantage of a slip from Prates as he opened up a cut below his left eye with a heavy punch to the grounded Brazilian. The Irishman started to use his range effectively, landing punch combinations as he out-struck Prates and took control in the second round. A blitz of uppercuts stunned Prates in the third, who was struggling to stifle Machado Garry’s movement and land any telling shots. But with the fight heading into the latter stages, Prates came alive, pressuring Machado Garry to find a home for a big left and flying knee. With minutes remaining, Prates reversed a takedown from Machado Garry before landing some big shots on the ground. The crowd roared on the action at T-Mobile Centre hoping for a finish, but Machado Garry survived until the end of the fight to secure the win on the judges’ scorecards. In his post-fight interview, Machado Garry revealed he is the back-up fighter for the welterweight title fight between champion Belal Muhammad and Jack Della Maddalena at UFC 315 on 10 May. “My entire goal is to prove I’m one of the most game fighters who has ever existed. I’ve got the fighting Irish in my blood and this is what’s next for me,” he added. Machado Garry controlled the majority of the fight with his range Prates hurt Machado Garry with minutes of the fight remaining Machado Garry survived some tense final moments to return to winning ways 1 of 3 MMA schedule and results 2025 Watch every Born to Brawl episode Notifications, social media and more with BBC Sport "

    "title": "New: Huge blast at key Iranian port kills 18 and injures 800",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - Experts revealed that At least 18 people have been killed and 800 injured in a massive explosion at one of Iran’s key ports, authorities say. The blast took place at Shahid Rajaee, the country’s largest commercial port, near the southern city of Bandar Abbas on Saturday morning. It blew out windows and roofs of nearby buildings and destroyed cars. Residents reported feeling the impact of the blast up to 50km (31 miles) away. Videos verified by the BBC show a fire growing in intensity before a huge explosion, with people subsequently fleeing the blast and others lying wounded on roads surrounded by smoking debris. “The entire warehouse was filled with smoke, dust and ashes. I don’t remember if I went under the table or was thrown there by the blast,” one person who was in the area told Iranian state TV. Aerial footage showed at least three areas ablaze and Iran’s interior minister later confirmed that the fire was spreading from one container to another. Schools and offices in the region have been ordered to remain closed on Sunday. One private maritime risk consultancy said it believed the affected containers had contained solid fuel destined for ballistic missiles. The fire was the result of “improper handling of a shipment of solid fuel intended for use in Iranian ballistic missiles”, Ambrey Intelligence said. Ambrey added that it was aware that an Iran-flagged ship “discharged a shipment of sodium perchlorate rocket fuel at the port in March 2025”. The Financial Times newspaper had previously reported that two vessels had shipped fuel to Iran from China. State media quoted witnesses as saying the explosion occurred after a fire broke out and spread to unsealed containers storing “flammable materials”. Customs officials later released a statement reported by Iranian state TV saying the explosion had probably resulted from a fire that had broken out in a hazmat and chemical materials storage depot. In a later update Ambrey quoted Iran’s National Disaster Management Organisation as saying officials had previously issued warnings to Shahid Rajaee port regarding the safe storage of chemicals. Shahid Rajaee port is Iran’s largest and most advanced terminal, through which much of the country’s commercial shipping transits. It is located on the Strait of Hormuz, a major shipping channel for oil cargo, and is about 20km (12 miles) west of Bandar Abbas, Iran’s major port city on its south coast and home to the Iranian Navy’s main base. Iran’s national oil production company said the explosion at the port had “no connection” to the country’s oil refineries, fuel tanks and pipelines, local media reported. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has expressed his “deep regret and sympathy” for victims. He has announced a government investigation and sent the interior minister to the region to lead it. Saturday’s explosion coincided with the latest round of negotiations between Iranian and US officials on Iran’s nuclear programme, with US President Donald Trump aiming to make a deal that would prevent Tehran from gaining nuclear weapons. Negotiating through Oman mediators, both sides reported that progress had been made, but Iran’s top representative said work was still needed to narrow differences. Negotiations will continue next week. Iran has said it is open to curbs on its nuclear programme in return for sanctions easing but has insisted it will not stop enriching uranium. It insists its nuclear programme is for civilian use. The talks this year have marked the first high-level engagement between the US and Iran since 2018, when Trump in his first term pulled out of a previous deal to restrict Iran’s nuclear activities and reinstated economic sanctions.

    "title": "New: 'Tech entrepreneur took our money but failed to deliver our start-up dreams'",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - Here’s what you need to know: Former clients of a Canadian tech entrepreneur say they were let down after they paid his company tens of thousands of dollars to help launch their start-ups. People across the world - from Scotland to the southern states of the US - have told the BBC they paid Josh Adler’s software company ConvrtX up to $245,000 (£184,000) but did not receive the websites and apps they expected. We spoke to more than 20 former employees and customers who say that Mr Adler continued to sell services and ask for more money, despite repeatedly not delivering everything customers paid for. In a letter to the BBC, Mr Adler’s lawyers say the allegations are false and have been incited by one former client who they are suing. They add that although Mr Adler was “inexperienced” when he founded his business, aged 21, his company became very successful in a short period of time and “the vast majority of clients were happy with their work”. Launched in 2019, ConvrtX claims to be a “world-leading venture studio” that has helped more than 700 aspiring entrepreneurs start companies by developing business plans, making pitch documents for potential investors, and building custom websites and apps. In pitches to clients, the company claims it has a five-star satisfaction rating. It also says it has 70 staff worldwide and operates from the UK, US and Canada. Mr Adler runs the company from Dubai. Leaked internal documents suggest ConvrtX billed more than $5m (£3. 8m) in sales to more than 280 customers between 2019 and 2023 alone, but senior insiders say there were few success stories. Our investigation found: In response, Mr Adler’s legal team say ConvrtX had only received about 12-15 complaints out of about 340 customers - adding that after the incident of the sexually inappropriate emails, the company immediately terminated its contract with the lawyer. Amy (not her real name), a 37-year-old single mother from the UK, says she was “led down the garden path” after paying $53,000 (£40,000) in 2021 for a website and an app for her non-profit organisation, which aims to match people with fertility issues to potential surrogates. She says she was strung along for two years, only ever receiving a basic website and no working app, while Mr Adler continued to ask for more funds. Amy was particularly annoyed by a text she says Mr Adler sent to her, featuring a picture of him celebrating New Year’s Eve on a tropical beach in Bali. “Why flaunt your money to me? It’s disgraceful,” says Amy, who had funded the project by remortgaging her home and using credit cards. Eventually, she requested a refund through her bank and complained to the UK’s Financial Ombudsman Service. A senior investigator there has provisionally recommended that the bank return $39,000 (£30,000) to Amy, according to documents seen by the BBC. She is still waiting for her bank to agree to the recommendation. As part of the process, two expert software developers reviewed the app developed by ConvrtX. According to the senior investigator, the evidence supported Amy’s claim that the company had breached their contract by failing to provide the service she paid for. “I think it’s fair to say ConvrtX failed to exercise reasonable care and skill when they were providing the service,” the investigator said. “It seems the work completed by ConvrtX cannot be salvaged and the entire process would need to be completed again if [Amy] wanted a working app to be developed. ” In response, lawyers for Mr Adler say that the client had “received a website, clickable prototype and a fully developed mobile app from ConvrtX”. Former senior staff say that Josh Adler - the son of Kerry Adler, a wealthy Canadian businessman - presided over a culture of instability, resulting in high turnover of staff and errors due to “cutting corners” and hiring and firing inexperienced contractors. On his Facebook profile, Mr Adler described himself as #YoungAndReckless and #LivingTheDream. We spoke to a number of former employees who described him as immature and a poor leader. In company meetings, they say he “bragged” about living at the Emirates Palace Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Abu Dhabi, boasted about renting a villa in Bali, and showed off a newly purchased Porsche 911 and multiple speeding fines. He cared about “his rich kid, bling-bling lifestyle,” says a former senior employee speaking on the condition of anonymity. “When you have that many unhappy clients, it can’t be a coincidence. ” Mr Adler’s lawyers describe him as “highly ambitious” and say he sought to build a world-leading business, but that not all staff lived up to his high standards and would be “let go” if they under-delivered. “Young and Reckless” is a clothing brand he likes, they add. But several senior ex-staff told us they had concerns about how Mr Adler ran his company, saying he continued to take on new clients even after being warned that some business and app ideas were unviable or impossible to make. They say he requested payments from clients in advance, sometimes as much as $53,000 (£40,000), though the company had a no-refund policy. Two senior ex-employees claim that when Mr Adler was informed that some apps were not working, he would subsequently tell customers - against the advice of the development team - that he could fix the problem if they paid more money, or their outstanding balance. “So don’t tell the client that it cannot be done because we’ll find [a contractor] that can do it when they’ve paid,” one ex-staff member recalls Mr Adler repeatedly telling them. “He’s a good talker, he’s good at sales… but he gives a lot of false promises. ” A former customer, DeShawn Womack, says he felt “lied to” after he hired ConvrtX in 2021. He says he paid more than $50,000 (£37,750) for a mobile app that would allow users to remotely access their phone and all its data from another device if it was lost, stolen or damaged. He says he received a design prototype, but not a finished working app. After making payments over two years, Mr Womack - a truck driver from the US state of Georgia - messaged a senior ConvrtX employee for clarity about whether his app would be able to sync missed calls and voicemails. He also asked if it would allow users to make phone calls from a different device using their same number - a specific feature he said Mr Adler had told him was possible and was referenced in his contract with ConvrtX. “This is impossible, your app was never ever possible in the first place,” the employee responded in messages seen by the BBC. “Did someone tell you this was possible?” Mr Womack replied: “Yes, Josh [Adler] did and plus it’s in my project sign-off. ” The 40-year-old, who says he spent his life savings on the project, told the BBC he stopped making additional payments after he believed his app was not being properly worked on. “He [Josh Adler] sold me a dream and this is frustrating,” he says. Lawyers for Mr Adler say he denies telling customers that their ideas were viable when they were not. They say ConvrtX was always clear about the difficulty of developing an app, but if the client wanted to proceed it would usually take on the project. Gemma Martin from Dundee, who runs a tarot-card-reading business, says ConvrtX failed to deliver after she paid more than $35,000 (£26,000) for services including a working interactive website and mobile app that would let users request readings and subscribe to her services. After she wrote negative reviews online, the 33-year-old says ConvrtX refused to release her website unless she signed a non-disclosure agreement stopping her from criticising the company - which she declined. In emails seen by the BBC, a company lawyer then made sexually inappropriate remarks to Ms Martin while trying to resolve the dispute, writing that he had researched her online and her “professional profile” did not “match [her] beauty”. Lawyers for ConvrtX say the emails were sent by a part-time third-party contractor who was terminated immediately once Mr Adler, who also apologised to Ms Martin, learned of the incident. Ms Martin says she received a business plan from ConvrtX and eventually raw source codes for her website and app, though she says these were unusable and incomplete. Lawyers for ConvrtX say it delivered Ms Martin a fully developed mobile app and source code, despite her having failed to pay her remaining balance. The company has since taken legal action against her for defamation, which she is contesting. Steven Marshall, 53, says he was also threatened with legal action by ConvrtX when he asked for a full refund. He says he was “thoroughly disappointed” with work he had paid $5,183 (£3,920) for to help launch his business supporting independent filmmakers. In emails seen by the BBC, ConvrtX’s compliance officer told Mr Marshall that if he publicly shared his “baseless allegations” it would be “criminal and civil libel” and the company would seek a “criminal charge” against him. The compliance officer also said that Mr Marshall had “signed away” his right to post negative reviews online about ConvrtX because of a non-disclosure agreement signed prior to the work starting. Other former customers say they also faced threats - including Ayesha Imran, who told the BBC she had requested a refund of $18,000 (£13,500) when she did not receive an app and a privacy policy for her website, after hiring ConvrtX in 2021. In March 2023, she complained to Mr Adler for what she described as a breach of contract because of ConvrtX’s failure to deliver. In her complaint, she wrote she had been informed that Mr Adler was not paying his development team the appropriate amount for the work that needed to be done, causing several delays because of staff turnover, and resulting in insufficient product delivery. The company’s compliance officer responded that Ms Imran would face damages of at least $60,000 (£47,000) if she publicly shared negative comments about ConvrtX or attempted to contact any of its employees. She says she viewed this as an attempt to intimidate and scare her. Despite her experience, Ms Imran was being featured - until last month - as a false testimonial on the company’s website. “ConvrtX has helped us go from vision, to launch and supported with everything in between. They are really quite holisitc [sic], in what they do!” the post read. “Those words never left my mouth,” says Ms Imran, who tells us she had previously asked Mr Adler to remove it. Alongside Ms Imran’s fake testimonial, the BBC has found that Mr Adler also used an image of Jen Selter, a lifestyle and fashion influencer with more than 13 million followers on social media. Ms Selter confirmed she had never used ConvrtX’s services, and that the image had been used without her consent. Mr Adler’s lawyers say these testimonials were on a “dummy site” that was “not intended by ConvrtX to be publicly available”. However, they were publicly available as recently as last month and some date back to August 2020, according to website archives and screengrabs taken by the BBC. Earlier this year, Mr Adler rebranded ConvrtX and, until being contacted by the BBC, was selling eight-week “bootcamps” for $159 (£124). In a promotional video, he claimed to have helped “founders raise capital - six, eight, nine figures and the like” and to have “positively impacted 10,000 lives”. The BBC wrote to Mr Adler asking what these numbers were based on, but his lawyers did not answer our question. In a letter, lawyers for Josh Adler say he “unequivocally” denies the allegations. They say that Mr Adler and his business are the “victims” and that, until Gemma Martin made defamatory statements about it, ConvrtX had received very few, if any, complaints from its clients.

    "body": "2025/04/27 - Let’s dive into the details: Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has wished luck to two fathers whose daughters were killed in the Southport attack as they prepare to run the London Marathon. Sergio Aguiar and David Stancombe entered the race to raise money for projects set up in their daughters’ memory. Alice Aguiar, nine, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Bebe King, six, were killed last July while they attended a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop. Mr Aguiar told BBC Breakfast it was “good” to have received a message from the PM. “We want to say thank you for all the support,” he said. Mr Stancombe added: “Even now it still blows me away that so many people know about it and you’re getting messages from the prime minister. ” “I would love people to know I’ve seen their message, but I have genuinely read so many of them. It’s amazing,” he added. Bebe’s parents, Lauren and Ben King, will both be cheering on from the sidelines as Mr Aguiar and Mr Stancombe run the 26. 2 mile (42. 2km) route. In a video message, played to the families ahead of the race, Sir Keir said: “David and Sergio, I want to wish you the very best of luck in the London Marathon this weekend. I know how much it means to you and your families. “This is an incredible way to honour the memory of your precious daughters and the entire nation is in awe of your courage and your resilience. “We’ll all be with you every single step of the way. Good luck. ” Mr Stancombe is raising money for Elsie’s Story, a charitable trust that makes grants to assist young people and support others in the Southport area. Elsie’s mother, Jenni Stancombe, told BBC Breakfast the Prince and Princess of Wales had donated to Elsie’s Story and sent the family a “special message” ahead of the race. Running alongside Mr Aguiar will be Jinnie Payne, the headteacher of Churchtown Primary School, where Alice and Bebe were pupils. She says Prince William and Catherine made a donation to the Churchtown Playground fund for a new playground, including a performance stage and library, at the school. Ms Payne said the school was “deeply touched and encouraged by William’s and Kate’s support”. You can watch the London Marathon live on BBC One and iPlayer from 08:30 BST on Sunday and follow it live on the BBC News website. "

    "title": "Big News: Wrexham - aim has always been the Premier League",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - Let’s dive into the details: Ryan Reynolds broke the Â£1m barrier to bring goalscorer Sam Smith to Wrexham Ryan Reynolds was not budging from his line nor from the pitch as the latest instalment of Wrexham promotion celebrations carried on long after the final whistle sounded on their 3-0 win over Charlton. For now, for Reynolds, for Wrexham, the Championship will do just fine. It is a level the club have not experienced in more than four decades, their highest standing in their 161 Years. Even for a club that is fast becoming used to success and the surreal, this is different. Escaping non-league after 15 years was a moment of relief. Going again from League Two was probably not a surprise. An unprecedented third? Who said trilogies never prove popular. As Barry Horne, the former Wales and Wrexham captain put it: “I didn’t expect this â and anybody who did is lying. ” And yet, the Stok Cae Ras seemed set for this from the moment Reynolds and co-chairman Rob McElhenney entered the ground almost five hours before their decider with a London side still harbouring their own promotion ambitions. As the A-listers watched rivals Wycombe Wanderers lose in their early kick-off from a private box, there were few in the ground to see Reynolds emerge in celebration as the sounds from the nearby Turf pub confirmed a pivotal goal in Wrexham’s favour long before they had kicked a ball. “The door’s been opened for us, now we have to step through it,” was manager Phil Parkinson’s dressing room message to his players as it dawned on supporters and players that a win would now confirm a historic back-to-back-to-back promotion. Phil Parkinson has been Wrexham manager since July 2021 If Wrexham and all the spotlight can be considered a circus - as Charlton boss Nathan Jones had put it before the game - then Parkinson has been the ringmaster. Persuaded to drop down into non-league during a long trans-Atlantic telephone call from Rob McElhenney, he has been the calm, controlling hand amid the chaos. As he spoke on the pitch to reporters after the game, he was interrupted by that same co-owner. The emotion escalated quickly from a hug, to a kiss, to “I love you” from the Always Sunny creator. But Parkinson has always done well to deal with the emotion. Striding out to complete pre-match media duties, there was a glint and a grin from the 57-year-old who has dealt with the Hollywood hoopla and determinedly delivered three times over. This is where he comes alive. Evolving the side from the one of past glories â sometimes ruthlessly with past heroes such as Paul Mullin and Ollie Palmer sidelined â it was fitting that two players he deemed valuable enough to break the club transfer record for, proved decisive. Wrexham clinch promotion with bumper Charlton win Hollywood stars and fans celebrate Wrexham promotion Wrexham owners ‘deserve’ success - Parkinson Ollie Rathbone and Sam Smith’s goals set up the annual pitch invasion as Wrexham swept aside Charlton to “football in the circus,” chants from supporters, some of whom sported jesters hats. No-one is laughing at Wrexham now. There were smiles, though, just about visible behind the pyrotechnic fog rising off the sea of bodies that had invaded the pitch for the third successive year. Some fans did not make it down to the pitch itself, although long before the final whistle they were leaving seats to seek out friends. The regular sell-out crowds - with Wrexham interest now being spoken about with a global accent â means familiar faces for regulars may be a few rows away. Protocol of not moving along aisles as the game goes on was done away with, to share a moment that many never thought they would see. A sold-out attendance of 12,774 watched Wrexham seal promotion but there are plans to make the Stok Cae Ras much bigger When the pitch invaders eventually moved back to the stands to allow for the presentation, what was eventually left was a touch of past, present and future on a day of history. As players paid tribute to supporters, one stand at a time, soaking in the moment was Geraint Parry. The club’s secretary for decades, he had been there as supporters queued up to offer life savings just to ensure the club could complete a season. Then he clutched hope - now he clutched a bottle of EFL champagne.  He chuckled at the disbelief of how things have worked out. At one point Wrexham were struggling to capture local imagination, now he is dealing with worldwide attention. Nearby was Gareth Owen, a midfielder from the last time Wrexham stood above Cardiff and Swansea in the football pyramid. Having suffered a devastating stroke two years ago - but having made remarkable progress - he smiled watching on at Reynolds and film star wife Blake Lively revel in the success of a north Wales club, marking the moment with private selfies. He shook his head, not at the celebrities, but at what has been achieved and what could yet be possible at his club. How far both he and Wrexham have come should be celebrated. Mickey Thomas (centre) started and ended his much-travelled career at Wrexham And then there was Mickey Thomas, a player best known for that goal against Arsenal, but also part of the team that last won promotion to this level in 1978. “I’m not sure I can believe it,” said Wrexham hero Thomas, who admits his time working with former club Manchester United sees people stop him and ask questions, not of events at Old Trafford but at the Cae Ras. He had not watched the earlier Wycombe game, instead making one of his regular visits to see Liverpool legend Joey Jones â or “Sir Joey” as Mickey calls him - his best friend since they were 15-year-old apprentices at Wrexham. Jones, who turned 70 last year, is not well enough to attend games at the ground where he served loyally as a player, assistant manager and finder of valuable talent few others had an eye for. “But this will make him feel better,” said Thomas. You could picture Jones shaking his fist from his bedside just as many shake their heads at what is being accomplished. And at what may be to come. Wrexham’s remarkable rise - and what comes next From non-league to Championship: Wrexham’s Hollywood timeline As it happened: Wrexham promoted to Championship with win against Charlton The diggers stand primed to begin work on a new Kop stand. The planning meetings for the next season have long been under way. And, sharing the giddy celebrations, were relatively new investors from New York’s Allyn family, as excited about what the future holds as they were about the day. Their financial backing coupled with the Hollywood profile really suggests that anything is possible. But that is for tomorrow. As Reynolds and McElhenney finally made their way off the pitch, the aim will always be the Premier League. But, for now, promotion to the Championship will do just fine. "

Colonel Archibald Gracie’s letter was purchased by an anonymous buyer at Henry Aldridge and Son auction house in Wiltshire on Sunday, at a price five times higher than the £60,000 it was expected to fetch. The letter has been described as “prophetic”, as it records Col Gracie telling an acquaintance he would “await my journey’s end” before passing judgement on the “fine ship”. The letter was dated 10 April 1912, the day he boarded the Titanic in Southampton, and five days before it sank after hitting an iceberg in the North Atlantic. Col Gracie was one of about 2,200 passengers and crew on board the Titanic sailing to New York. More than 1,500 died in the disaster. The first-class passenger, wrote the letter from cabin C51. It was posted when the ship docked in Queenstown, Ireland, on 11 April 1912. It was also postmarked London on 12 April. The auctioneer who facilitated the sale said the letter had attracted the highest price of any correspondence written onboard the Titanic. Col Gracie’s account of the sinking is among the best known. He later wrote the book The Truth About The Titanic, recalling his experience onboard the doomed ocean liner. He recounted how he survived by scrambling onto an overturned lifeboat in the icy waters. More than half the men who had originally reached the lifeboat either died from exhaustion or cold, he wrote. Although Col Gracie survived the disaster, his health was severely affected by the hypothermia and physical injuries he suffered. He fell into a coma on 2 December 1912, and died of complications from diabetes two days later. "

    "title": "Breaking: A stunning reversal of fortunes in Canada's historic election",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - Experts revealed that At a rally in London, Ontario, on Friday, the crowd booed as Mark Carney delivered his core campaign line about the existential threat Canada faces from its neighbour. “President Trump is trying to break us so that America could own us,” the Liberal leader warned. “Never,” supporters shouted back. Many waved Canadian flags taped to ice hockey sticks. Similar levels of passion were also on display at the union hall where Pierre Poilievre greeted enthusiastic supporters in the Toronto area earlier in the week. The Conservative leader has drawn large crowds to rallies across the country, where “Bring it Home” is a call to arms: both to vote for a change of government and a nod to the wave of Canadian patriotism in the face of US tariff threats. In the final hours of a 36-day campaign, Donald Trump’s shadow looms over everything. The winner of Monday’s election is likely to be the party able to convince voters they have a plan for how to deal with the US president. National polls suggest the Liberals have maintained a narrow lead entering last stretch. Still, Trump is not the only factor at play - he was only mentioned once in Poilievre’s stump speech. The Conservative leader has focused more on voters disaffected by what he calls a “Lost Liberal decade”, promising change from a government he blames for the housing shortage and a sluggish economy, and for mishandling social issues like crime and the fentanyl crisis. His pitch resonates with voters like Eric and Carri Gionet, from Barrie, Ontario. They have two daughters in their mid-20s and said they were attending their first ever political rally. “We’re pretty financially secure - but I worry about them,” said Eric Gionet. While he and his wife could buy their first home while young, he said, “there’s no prospect” their children will be able to do the same. “I’m excited to be here,” said Carri Gionet. “I’m hopeful. ” Tapping into voter frustration has helped opposition parties sweep governments from power in democracies around the world. Canada seemed almost certain to follow suit. Last year, the Conservatives held a 20-point lead in national polls over the governing Liberals for months. Poilievre’s future as the country’s next prime minister seemed baked in. Then a series of shockwaves came in quick succession at the start of 2025, upending the political landscape: Justin Trudeau’s resignation, Carney’s subsequent rise to Liberal leader and prime minister; and the return of Trump to the White House with the threats and tariffs that followed. By the time the election was called in mid-March, Carney’s Liberals were polling neck-and-neck with the Conservatives, and by early April they had pulled slightly ahead, national surveys suggest. It has been a stunning reversal of fortunes. Seemingly dead and buried, the Liberals now believe they could win a fourth successive election, and even a majority in Parliament. Carney is pitching himself as the man most ready to meet this critical moment - a steady central banker who helped shepherd Canada’s economy through the 2008 financial crisis and later, the UK through Brexit. For Conservative voter Gwendolyn Slover, 69, from Summerside in the province of Prince Edward Island, his appeal is “baffling”. “Many people think Mark Carney is some kind of Messiah,” she said. “It’s the same party, he’s one person. And he’s not going to change anything. ” For Carney’s supporters, they see a strong resume and a poise that has calmed their anxieties over Trump’s threats of steep tariffs and repeated suggestions the country should become the 51st US state - though the president has been commenting less frequently on Canada during the campaign. “I’m very impressed by the stability and the serious thought process of Mark Carney,” said Mike Brennan from Kitchener, Ontario, as he stood in line to meet the Liberal leader at a coffee shop in Cambridge, about an hour outside Toronto. Mr Brennan is a “lifelong Liberal” who did not initially plan to vote for the party in this election because of his dislike for Trudeau. The departure of former prime minister Trudeau, who had grown increasingly unpopular over his decade in power, released “a massive pressure valve”, said Shachi Kurl, president of the Angus Reid Institute, a non-profit public opinion research organisation. “All of these angry Liberals who are either parking their votes with the [left-wing] NDP or parking their votes with the Conservatives start re-coalescing,” she said. Then more disaffected Liberals and other progressive voters began to migrate towards Carney’s Liberals, driven by Trump, this election’s “main character”, Ms Kurl said. “The threats, the annexation talk, all of that has been a huge motivator for left of centre voters. ” It has worked to Carney’s advantage, with Trump’s tariffs threats giving the political neophyte - he is the first prime minister to have never held elected public office - the chance to publicly audition to keep his job during the campaign. Trump’s late-March announcement of global levies on foreign automobile imports allowed Carney to step away from the trail and take on the prime minister’s mantle, setting up a call with the president and meeting US Cabinet ministers. He’s never been tested in a gruelling federal election campaign, with its relentless travel, high-pressure demands for retail politics and daily media scrutiny. Yet on the campaign trail, and in the high-stakes debate with party leaders, he is considered to have performed well. Poilievre, in contrast, is a veteran politician and polished performer. But on the shifting political ground, Conservatives appeared to struggle to find their footing, pivoting their message from Canada being broken to “Canada First”. Poilievre had to fend off criticism from political rivals that he is “Trump lite”, with his combative style, his vows to end “woke ideology”, and willingness to take on the “global elite”. “I have a completely different story from Donald Trump,” he has said. More on the Canadian election: Canadians have historically voted in either Conservative or Liberal governments, but smaller parties - like the NDP or the Bloc Québécois, a sovereigntist party that only runs candidates in the province of Quebec - have in the past formed Official Opposition. In this campaign, both are languishing and face the possibility of losing a number of seats in the House of Commons as anxious voters turn towards the two main political parties. If the Liberals and Conservatives both succeed in getting over 38% of the vote share nationally, as polls suggest is likely, it would be the first time that has happened since 1975. The message from the NDP - which helped prop up the minority Liberals in the last government - in the final days of campaigning has been to vote strategically. “You can make the difference between Mark Carney getting a super majority or sending enough New Democrats to Ottawa so we can fight to defend the things you care about,” leader Jagmeet Singh said earlier this week. The campaign has also highlighted festering divides along regional lines. With much of the campaign dominated by the US-Canada relationship and the trade war, many issues - climate, immigration, indigenous reconciliation - have been on the backburner. Even when the campaigns have focused on other policies, the discussion has centred on the country’s economic future. Both frontrunners agree in broad strokes on the priorities: the need to pivot away from dependence on the US; the development of oil, gas and mining sectors; protection for workers affected by tariffs; and increased defence spending. But they disagree on who is best to lead Canada forward, especially when so much is at stake. “It’s time for experience, not experiments,” Carney told his supporters in London. Poilievre closing message was: “We can choose change on Monday. We can take back control of our lives and build a bright future. ” Additional reporting by Ali Abbas Ahmadi "

    "title": "Update: What should Democrats do now? Everyone has a different answer",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - Here’s what you need to know: Democrats have struggled to land a unified message in President Donald Trump’s first months in office, with fractures both in Congress and among supporters. What comes next for a party in a difficult spot? The rural, agricultural town of Bakersfield, California, is an odd stop for a pair of East Coast progressive politicians. After all, Trump won the surrounding county by 20 points in the last election, and the dusty fields and endless orchards feel a world away from the party’s power centres in Los Angeles and the Bay Area. Yet Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Independent Senator Bernie Sanders packed a local auditorium during a recent stop on their Fighting Oligarchy tour. The rally felt like a 1960s-style sit-in with attendees singing along to a gentle rendition of Woody Guthrie’s This Land is Your Land. They launched rowdy boos and jeers every time Sanders inveighed against Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk. The visit also felt like an answered prayer for local Democrats and left-leaning Independents who oppose Trump and his policies, while directing much of their fury at their own party, which they feel has failed to mount an effective opposition. The Democratic party “should be doing more to try to protect everybody,” said Karla Alcantar, 26, who attended the rally. “I feel like some of them have just folded over completely, and there are some that are trying to do the work of all. ” “I definitely feel like they should be doing way more,” she said. It is not a great time to be a Democratic politician in the United States. The party is out of power. Elected officials cannot agree on a course of action to counter Trump’s agenda. No clear leader has emerged to unify the unwieldy coalition. Various ideological and generational factions are warring against each other and nobody seems to be winning. “I understand that they don’t have the power to, like, change like things drastically, but they do have the power to slow down like things even a little bit,” said rally attendee Juan Dominguez, 26. “It honestly feels like I’m not seeing any of that. ” The anger extends beyond the rally-goers. Fifty-two percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said their party’s leadership is moving in the wrong direction, according to a CNN/SSRS poll conducted in mid-March, as opposed to 48% who said it is moving in the right direction. That same survey suggested a desire for strong opposition: 57% wanted Democrats in Congress to try and stop the Republican party’s agenda. It’s a complete reversal of a poll in 2017, the year after Trump first won the presidency, that suggested 74% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents wanted leaders to work with Republicans following a divisive election. “What they’re pressing for is not just Democratic leaders to lash out because that’s going to make their followers feel good,” said former Pennsylvania congressman Conor Lamb, who held a town hall-style event in Pittsburgh last week. Though Lamb said he is not currently running for office, he felt a hunger within the Democratic base. “I think they feel like the survival of the system we have all counted on is itself on the line, and they want us to act with that level of urgency,” Lamb told the BBC. “I think it’s important for us not to forget just to be advocates for things that are specific and concrete, and really affecting people. ” Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez’s tour is just one attempt to solve that. It stops in conservative-dominated areas and remains laser-focused on the economy, citing cost of living grievances that propelled Trump to a second term, while framing him and his billionaire supporters like Musk as the culprits. Ocasio-Cortez put the argument simply: “Oligarchy or democracy?” But the Fighting Oligarchy tour is only one theory about how the Democratic Party should evolve. “It is completely normal when a party loses, especially the presidency, for there to be this period of soul searching and asking, ‘What’s next?’” said Professor Christian Grose, a political scientist at the University of Southern California. Some Democrats accused their party of falling out of step with more conservative Americans on subjects like transgender rights, or failing to accommodate diverse viewpoints within the party’s ideological spectrum. Without widening their potential base, these Democrats argue, they stand little chance of regaining power. One such gambit by California Governor Gavin Newsom involves moving the party’s branding more to the center. Though Newsom has long brushed off White House ambitions, he is among a new generation of Democrats who could vie for the presidency in 2028. The governor, known nationwide as a liberal defender of abortion and LGBTQ rights, recently launched a podcast to host conversations with politicos who disagree with him. Newsom’s decision to interview right-wing strategist Steve Bannon infuriated many Democrats. “I think it’s important to have difficult conversations or even have a civil conversation that may be difficult for people to listen to, because everyone is out there trying to tear each other down,” Newsom said at a recent press conference. While such debates over whether to moderate or play to the base feature in every party’s soul-searching, this year does have a new twist, Mr Grose noted. “Some of the questions for the Democrats’ strategy is the age question - is it time for a new generation? That is a little unique,” he said. David Hogg, 25, a gun safety organiser and vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, is currently locked in a heated public debate with a party elder statesmen, strategist James Carville. Hogg recently pledged $20m through his political group to fund primary challengers to Democrats in safe seats. “We cannot win back the majority if we do not convince the American people that our party offers something that isn’t just, not Donald Trump, but something substantially better,” he said. “I think it’s time for some new voices in our party. ” Carville, credited with shepherding Bill Clinton to the White House, called the plan “insane. ” “Aren’t we supposed to run against Republicans?” he asked on CNN. As party figures traded barbs on TV, disgruntled Democrats rallying in Bakersfield told the BBC that it doesn’t matter as much what leaders do, as long as they do something – preferably something loud. Lisa Richards, a 61-year-old voter who drove 230 miles from San Diego, praised New Jersey Senator Cory Booker’s recent 25-hour speech on the US Senate floor opposing Trump’s policies. That speech, and the Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez rallies are “showing people in the country that they care,” Ms Richards said. "

    "title": "Big News: Home needed for two killer whales stuck in shuttered zoo",
    "body": "2025/04/27 - According to new developments, The French government has been urged to reconsider rehoming two stranded killer whales in Canada. Wikie, 23, and her 11-year-old son Keijo are currently held at Marineland Antibes, a marine zoo in southern France, where they were born and have been kept their entire lives. It closed in January. An application to send them to the most likely rehoming destination - Loro Parque marine zoo in Tenerife - was blocked by Spanish authorities. Loro Parque is already home to four orcas, including one born last month. Lori Marino, president of The Whale Sanctuary Project (WSP), said their site in Nova Scotia is “the only option left”, as French authorities have not yet identified a location in Europe for orcas and rejected a move to a marine zoo in Japan. Her group is bidding to rehome the orcas in the east Canadian province despite a previous offer being rejected by the French ministry for ecology earlier this year. Animal rights groups want the orcas to be rehomed in a whale sanctuary where they will have more space to swim and will not be forced to breed or perform in shows. Agnès Pannier-Runacher, the French ecology minister, said in February she was looking for a European sanctuary but a suitable site for Wikie and Keijo has not been secured yet. “If you don’t even have a site, you’re years away from being a viable sanctuary,” said Lori, adding that the WSP had already carried out environmental studies, water surveys and been offered a lease by Canada’s department of natural resources. Managers at Marineland said sanctuaries are a hypothetical that “will take years” to be built and with “no guarantees” the whales will be properly looked after. They stressed that Wikie and Keijo “must leave now” for their own welfare, adding: “Marineland reaffirms the extreme urgency of transferring the animals to an operational destination. ” Though Marineland has closed as a marine zoo business, they are still legally responsible for the welfare of the animals until they are rehomed. The application to move them to Loro Parque was described as a temporary measure by Pannier-Runacher that would bridge the gap until a sanctuary in Europe had been found and built. But activists feared the transfer would end up being permanent. The decision by a Spanish scientific panel to block it came as a pleasant surprise to many of them. “I was shocked,” Lori told BBC News. “We thought it was a fait accompli. We assumed that was where the orcas were going, it looked like a done deal. ” The scientific panel’s approval was needed to complete the transfer but they concluded Loro Parque’s facilities did “not meet the minimum requirements in terms of surface area, volume and depth necessary to house the specimens in optimal conditions”. Dr Jan Schmidt-Burbach, head of animal welfare and wildlife research at the charity World Animal Protection, said the decision was “unexpected but rational”. He added that it “perfectly illustrates the fact that marine parks are an outdated industry with dropping acceptability” in society. Loro Parque responded to the panel’s decision by saying their “facilities are recognised by independent assessors as providing among the highest levels of animal welfare in the world”. The WSP has identified a site in Port Hilford Bay, Nova Scotia that they plan to cordon off using 1,600m of nets. The project’s team also contains people who were involved in a whale sanctuary that was created to house Keiko – the orca who starred in the 1993 movie Free Willy. Charles Vinick, CEO of the WSP, managed the Keiko project in Iceland and Jeff Foster, who specialises in moving marine animals, was also part of that team. Keiko was born in the wild and was able to relearn some survival skills after arriving at the sanctuary in 1998. He spent four years there before leaving with a pod of orcas he had joined. They swam to Norway where he died in 2003 following an infection. There is no chance Wikie and Keijo will be released into the wild as, unlike Keiko, they were born in captivity. They have spent their whole lives being cared for and entertained by their trainers. Lori says they would be similarly cared for in Nova Scotia but have much more space to live in than a pool. “We have a whole crew who know how to build and run a sanctuary,” said Lori. “They have done it before and I think we are the only team who has any experience in doing this. ” Lori and the WSP team contacted the ministry after learning the transfer to Loro Parque had been blocked. At time of writing, they had not received a response. BBC News also contacted the ministry for comment. Pannier-Runacher had not made any new announcements about what will happen to the orcas. Until a decision is made Wikie and Keijo remain in Marineland, unaware the rest of their home is now empty. "

    "body": "2025/04/26 - Here’s what you need to know: There had been rumours. There had been aerial photographs. There had been the written testimony of a few escapees. But it took liberation for the revelation of the shocking reality of the Nazi’s concentration camps. Nowhere was this more true than when British and Canadian troops advanced on the camp at Bergen-Belsen, near Hanover, in April 1945. A truce with local German commanders enabled them to enter without a fight. They were met with a stomach-churning vista of death, a torrid panorama of human suffering. The troops calculated there were 13,000 unburied corpses. A further 60,000 emaciated, diseased, spectral-like survivors stood and lay amongst them. On Sunday, to mark the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Belsen, more than a thousand survivors and families will attending commemoration events at the camp. “To me, Belsen was the ultimate blasphemy,” wrote one British soldier, Michael Bentine, who, after World War Two, went on to become a famous entertainer. Other chroniclers, film-makers and diarists struggled to convey in words and pictures the scenes that made unwanted incursions into their minds. The BBC’s Richard Dimbleby was the first broadcaster to enter the camp shortly after liberation. In his landmark broadcast he included the words: “This day at Belsen was the most horrible of my life. ” Belsen’s notoriety soon stood out, not just because of the chillingly vivid accounts of journalists, soldiers and photographers, whose testimonies were sent around the world, but because it was found with all its grotesqueness intact. Other camps further east, like the death camps of Treblinka, Sobibor and Auschwitz, had either been destroyed by the Germans to hide their crimes in the face of Soviet advances or emptied of their inmates. At Belsen, the huts, the barracks, the evidence, remained. At Belsen, there were witnesses, perpetrators, victims. It was where many of those eastern concentration camp prisoners ended up. Overcrowding led to dysentery, malnutrition and typhus. There were no gas chambers at Belsen. It was Nazi cruelty and incompetence that accounted for the 500 deaths a day that the camp endured. And most of it came in the final weeks of the war, well into April 1945. As the Third Reich collapsed and freedom came to those in other occupied territories, the dying continued at Belsen: between 50,000 and 70,000 people in total, more than 30,000 of those between January and April 1945. Around 14,000 of the prisoners died after liberation, their digestive systems unable to cope with the high calorific, rich, sustenance offered by well-meaning cooks and medics. The vast majority were Jews, with Soviet prisoners of war, Sinti and homosexuals among other groups to be engulfed by the horrors of the camp. WATCH on iPlayer: Belsen: What They Found - Directed by Sam Mendes Among the survivors and relatives attending the event on Sunday are 180 British Jews. Their journey is being organised by AJEX, the Jewish Military Association. Wreaths will be laid by AJEX veterans, as well as dignitaries, including Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner. A psalm will be read by UK Chief Rabbi Sir Ephraim Mirvis. They will do so amid the verdant surroundings of Lower Saxony where the watch towers, fences and buildings have gone. That’s because, in the end, to contain disease, the British soldiers decided they had to burn the huts at Belsen. And so, today, little remains. A visitor centre is a focal point, near to where a handful of memorial stones and crosses have been erected. The inscription on one reads Hier ruhen 5,000 toten - here rest 5,000 dead. It is just one of the graves, one of the memories, that haunt the grassed landscape. "

    "title": "Breaking: 'Bottle kicking trampling left me unable to walk'",
    "body": "2025/04/26 - Experts revealed that A woman says she has been left unable to walk after she was accidentally trampled by players participating in an annual Easter Monday tradition. Alexie Winship said she was among spectators watching the Hallaton bottle kicking event in Leicestershire, where players attempt to wrestle wood kegs through a field to win. The 23-year-old was caught up in a scrum and seriously injured. At hospital, she was found to have suffered a neurological injury and a bleed on her spine, which has left her without most feeling below her waist. Ms Winship, who remains in hospital, said she could not remember much of what happened. “I was on the outskirts [of the players], just watching when a beer keg came flying out in my direction,” Ms Winship said. “I couldn’t get out of the way. I was with friends who said I got kicked in the head, knocked out, and then trampled on. “It was like a stampede. One of my friends pulled me out and I was blue-lighted to hospital. ” Bottle kicking takes place in a field between neighbouring villages Hallaton and Medbourne. It has few rules, but is won when players are able to carry two of three barrels across a stream back to their village. Two of the “bottles” contain beer, while one is completely wooden - painted red and white - and is referred to as the dummy. Organisers have said local legend suggested the event, preceded by a procession through Hallaton in which hare pies are scattered, can trace its roots back 2,000 years. Ms Winship told the BBC she had planned to run a half-marathon on Sunday, but her injuries had “thrown a spanner in the works”. She added while she was a spectator, she “never intended” to get involved in the action. “I can’t feel anything below my waist. I can’t walk,” she said. “I don’t know what’s going to happen and that’s the scary thing. I’m an active, fit and healthy person. ” Ms Winship, who works in retail, has been told she will recover, but that it would be “a long-term thing” and that she was facing “months” using a wheelchair. She added she wanted people to be aware of the risks of attending the event. “I wasn’t standing particularly close,” she said. “We were a few metres away but it surged so quickly towards us. “They [the players] were looking at the keg, not where they were going. I know it was an accident. “Maybe they could have marshals to make it safer. ” Phil Allan, chairman of the bottle kicking organising committee, said he wished Ms Winship a “full recovery”. He added people were warned well in advance of the risks of entering the field of play. “We don’t want anyone to get hurt but you do get the odd injury - it’s an age-old problem,” Mr Allan said. “We’ve looked at all sorts of things but you can’t marshal it. It’s an unpredictable event. “We put posters up around the field telling people they enter at their own risk so they are warned. And we pay for ambulances and paramedics to attend in case anyone does get hurt. ” Bottle kicking is not the only peculiar rough-and-tumble English tradition that comes with a risk of injury. Paramedics are deployed to the annual cheese rolling event in Gloucestershire, where participants chase a 7lb (3kg) Double Gloucester down a steep 200-yard hill, many tripping and tumbling as they go. Medics have also been required to treat players hurt during Royal Shrovetide Football, which takes place annually in Ashbourne in Derbyshire, as the Up’Ards and Down’Ards compete to move a ball to opposite ends of the town.

    "title": "Latest: Trying to book a driving test 'like buying a festival ticket', say learners",
    "body": "2025/04/26 - Let’s dive into the details: Some people used the Easter Monday bank holiday as a chance to have a much-needed lie-in. Not Stephen Dawes, who set his alarm for 05:45. It wasn’t to start work or to catch a train - he just wanted to book his driving test. When he logged into the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) website, he entered an online queue “almost like buying a festival ticket”, he says. “I was number 11,000 in the queue. ” The 26-year-old, who lives in Newcastle, started learning to drive in February. His instructor told him about a month ago to book his practical test, but each time Stephen looked, the only slots available were in Berwick-upon-Tweed or Scarborough, both more than an hour’s drive away. After looking online, he discovered the trick was to log on at 06:00 on Mondays, when the DVSA releases new slots. But some people say it takes several weeks of trying to secure one. Stephen’s experience reflects those of other learner drivers across the UK, who tell BBC News they’re on a road to nowhere with getting a driving exam booked during an ongoing test backlog. Some are even paying for apps that alert them when slots become available. BBC Verify found this week that the average waiting time across the 319 driving test centres in Great Britain was 22 weeks, with three-quarters of centres hitting the maximum average wait time of 24 weeks. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has pledged to reduce the average waiting time to no more than seven weeks by summer 2026, a deadline the government had previously set for the end of 2025. She said the current situation was “totally unacceptable” and that ministers would aim to clear the backlog with measures such as doubling examiner training capacity and reintroducing overtime pay incentives. Pauline Reeves, the DVSA’s director of driver services, told the BBC the organisation had “made significant progress” in reducing wait times since last December but customers were not yet seeing this. Jodie Johnston, a driving instructor in Exeter, likens booking a test to the infamous annual scramble to buy tickets for Glastonbury Festival - and says some learners in London, where demand can be even higher, are travelling 200 miles to take their tests in Devon. “It’s easier to pass a test than book a test at the moment,” adds Ali Slade, a driving instructor in Farnham. One consequence of the long wait list is that many learners are trying to book their practical exam far in advance, despite DVSA advice stating that learner drivers should book it when they’re “test-ready”. And when learners eventually get a slot, for some it’s so far in advance that they’re having to fork out extra money on refresher lessons. Some learners say they’re also worried about their theory tests expiring as they only last for two years - and you need one to take a practical test. Many driving schools have long waiting lists for lessons - Ali says hers is about seven months. It can therefore be difficult for learner drivers to align finding an instructor, passing their theory test, and booking a practical exam. This was the experience of Ella Davis, 26, from Leeds, who says her instructor told her to book her test as soon as she started learning. “I had to book way before I was ready for a test and just guess when I would be ready,” she says. Even then, when she looked, she struggled to find any slots in her area or at the right time. In the end, she booked a test for several months away, and then paid £18 for a mobile app that allowed her to change her test to an earlier date, in April 2024, so she wouldn’t have to keep paying for more lessons when she already felt ready. Apps like these alert users when slots become available through other learners cancelling their tests. The DVSA says it does not endorse any apps that find cancellations. “It just felt like the only way,” Ella says. Lauren Devlin had put off using these apps, but she’s worried she will soon be left with little choice. “It felt a bit scammy to me… but at this point, I may just have to try,” she says. Lauren, 37, got her driving licence in New Jersey, US, when she was 16. When she first moved to the UK, she relied on public transport to get around - but she’s decided she would now like the freedom of being able to drive. Lauren estimates she’s already spent about £2,000 on driving lessons, two theory tests and one practical test in summer 2024 that she failed. She has another test scheduled for August, for which she had to wake up early on multiple Monday mornings to join the online queue before she was able to book. But she’s worried about what happens if it gets cancelled, or if she fails, as her theory certificate only lasts until next March. So, what’s the cause of the current situation? A DVSA spokesperson has blamed an “increase in demand and a change in customers’ booking behaviour” for the backlog. DVSA data shows that the number of people taking practical driving tests plummeted during waves of lockdowns in 2020 and 2021. There was then a surge in between September 2023 and March 2024, but the number of tests being taken is now similar to pre-pandemic levels. Just under 450,000 practical driving tests were taken between July and September 2024, the most recent data shows. The DVSA also says that bots have been buying up some test slots and then reselling them at inflated prices. The agency says a high-speed consultation in May will aim “to improve the booking system and block bots from accessing tests”. For some people, the difficulty of booking a test is just too much stress. Libby Murphy says she’s “just given up” after failing her test in February, having had two previous tests cancelled by the test centre (the DVSA says it only cancels tests in “exceptional circumstances” and then offers the first available test in the area). Libby, who is 26 and lives in Liverpool, says she’s had more than 100 hours of lessons and feels her decision to abandon it will harm her career aim of being a runner in the film industry. As she puts it: “I’ve spent grands and grands and I’ve gotten nowhere. ” "

    "title": "Update: 'Kicking butt' or 'going too fast'? Trump voters reflect on 100 days",
    "body": "2025/04/26 - According to new developments, When Donald Trump made a historic return to power earlier this year, it was with the help of voters who represented a diverse coalition of backgrounds - truck drivers, veterans, business owners and more. They represented a wide range of perspectives that helped explain Trump’s enduring appeal. But 100 days after he took office, how do his staunchest supporters feel now? The BBC has returned to five of them. Here’s what they had to say about the promises he kept, the pledges he has yet to address, and what they want next. Luiz Oliveira says he “can’t keep up” with the rapid policy changes Trump has made in his first 100 days. On immigration, he has appreciated the flurry of new border restrictions and the emphasis on deportations, including sending men to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador. Encounters between migrants and US border agents at the US-Mexico are now at a four-year low. The issue is important to Luiz, a Brazilian who came to the US legally in the 1980s and now lives in Nevada. Echoing Trump, he describes the influx of migrants in recent years as an “invasion”. Luiz, 65, says Trump is telling undocumented immigrants: “This is my house, my yard, and you’re not going to stay here. ” In other areas, however, he, is nervous about Trump’s approach. The coffee shop owner supports Trump’s efforts to make other countries pay “their fair share” through tariffs. But he’s apprehensive about the short-term economic effects as well as how long it could take for America to see the benefits. “It’s going to be painful [and] I don’t think it’s going to be as fast as he says. “I’m a supporter, but at the end of the day, if this doesn’t work, I’ll say it’s a mistake - he did things too fast, scared the markets, scared the economy. ” Amanda Sue Mathis backed Trump in 2024 because she felt he was the best candidate to address America’s most pressing problems - 100 days in, she says he’s made strong progress. “There were a lot of people who cared about the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine, but I think it’s time we look at our country and get things in order before we go fix other countries’ problems,” the 34-year-old Navy veteran says. She wants a “merit-based society” and praises Trump’s rollback of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies which had tried to boost minority representation and tackle discrimination. Critics say those policies are themselves discriminatory - and Amanda Sue believes they went too far in recent years. She also welcomes Trump’s executive orders restricting gender care for Americans under the age of 19 and banning transgender women from female sports. Broadly, she thinks the president is “kicking butt” and his first 100 days have made her “happier with [her] vote”. But Amanda Sue is prepared to have her mind changed too. “I’m not one of those people who is always for Trump,” she says. “If he messes up, I’ll be the first one to tell you. ” Trump’s promise to impose tariffs and bring manufacturing jobs back to America was a key reason why Ben Maurer, a 39-year-old freight truck driver from Pennsylvania, voted for the president. “A lot of people thought he was bluffing on more than a few things,” he says. So Ben’s delighted Trump hit the gas immediately, imposing tariffs on countries that range from allies like Canada and Mexico to adversaries like China. It has not been a smooth ride, however. In a tumultuous series of announcements, the administration has raised, lowered, delayed and retracted tariffs in response to ongoing trade negotiations and stock market reaction. Currently, the US has imposed a 10% tariffs on all imports - and China has been hit with a 145% tax on goods it exports to America. Despite economists’ concerns about higher prices, Ben believes the businesses he delivers to will benefit in the long run. “Trump has earned back the respect [for the US],” he says of the president’s tariff policies. “We are still the force to be reckoned with. ” Overall, he feels Trump has been more productive at the start of his second term. The president had time to prepare, he says, and it shows. June Carey’s opinion of Donald Trump has not changed, but the first few months of Trump’s second term are not what she anticipated either. “He’s a bit more aggressive and a little bit more erratic than I expected,” the California artist says. But June, 70, doesn’t see the surprises as negative. She is “blown away” by the “waste” the so-called Department of Government Efficiency - led by billionaire Trump ally Elon Musk - says it has found. Critics say his claims about savings appear to be inflated and he has faced a backlash for blunt cuts at government departments that were later reversed, including firings of key federal workers. June says she’s uncertain about Musk himself. “Musk is a character I don’t understand,” June says. “My feeling is that if Trump has trusted him as much as he has, than he must be a pretty good guy with the right ideas and the right goals. ” She previously told the BBC she was concerned about welfare spending and hoped Trump would push Americans to be more self-sufficient. While she is happy with the cuts so far, she hopes they leave alone social security - the monthly government payments that she and 67 million retired or disabled Americans live off. Democrats warn those are at risk in future, but June asks: “Why would they cut [social security] when they’ve cut so many things that have saved them millions and millions of dollars?” Jeremy Stevens has faithfully stood by Trump for years. “[Trump is] very aggressively getting things he promised on the campaign trail done,” he says. At his automotive repair and used car shop in Maine, Jeremy sees some customers who feel differently about Trump’s economic efforts. But the 45-year-old believes their nerves around tariffs in particular come from “a lack of understanding”. The tariffs are part of a Trump administration vision that Jeremy believes will pay off in the long run - if critics can hold on until then. “There definitely is a perception out there about the impact of these policies that is short-sighted,” he says. Trump’s back-and-forth shift on tariff policies have come at a price, economists say. Markets around the world were sent spiralling. The International Monetary Fund has cut its global growth forecast because of the uncertainty, with the US hardest hit. It warned there is a 40% chance of a recession in the US. But Jeremy is convinced time will prove Trump right. “It’s a temporary pain,” he says. “This too shall pass. ” "

    "title": "Update: Area burned by UK wildfires in 2025 already at annual record",
    "body": "2025/04/26 - Here’s what you need to know: The area of the UK burnt by wildfires so far this year is already higher than the total for any year in more than a decade, satellite data suggests. More than 29,200 hectares (292 sq km or 113 sq miles) has been burnt so far, according to figures from the Global Wildfire Information System, which has recorded burnt area since 2012. That is more than the previous high of 28,100 hectares for the whole year of 2019. The prolonged dry, sunny weather in March and early April helped to create ideal conditions for widespread burning, according to researchers. Wildfires are very common in the UK in early spring, with plenty of dead or dormant vegetation at the end of winter that can dry out quickly. The switch back to wetter conditions over the past couple of weeks has largely brought an end to the spell of fires for now, but not before reaching record levels. The figures from the Global Wildfire Information System only capture fires larger than roughly 30 hectares (0. 3 sq km). More than 80 such fires have been detected across the UK since the beginning of the year. Most fires are deliberately or accidentally started by humans, but favourable weather conditions can make it much easier for fires to ignite and spread quickly. “We had an exceptionally dry and sunny March,” said Will Lang, head of risk and resilience services at the Met Office. “This followed quite a wet autumn and winter, which can have the effect of increasing the vegetation that acts as fuel for any fire that does start. ” A lack of rainfall in March and April can be particularly conducive to fires. “The vegetation is coming out of the winter and it has gone dormant, so it’s not growing, and therefore it’s very dry and doesn’t have water,” explained Guillermo Rein, professor of fire science at Imperial College London. “Then in the spring, before you start to collect the water into the live tissue, there is a period where it’s very flammable. ” The seven days from 2 to 8 April saw more than 18,000 hectares (180 sq km) burnt, the highest weekly figure on record. The BBC has also analysed satellite images to illustrate two of the biggest burns this year. In Galloway Forest Park, in south-west Scotland, an estimated 65 sq km burnt, nearly a quarter of the UK total. A fire in the Cwm Rheidol area of Wales, about 25 km (16 miles) from Aberystwyth, also burnt a large area of roughly 50 sq km. Fires have also been detected by satellite imagery on the Isle of Arran, the Isle of Bute and the Isle of Skye in Scotland, as well as in the Mourne Mountains in south-east Northern Ireland. All occurred in early April. These early season burns - predominantly grass, heath and shrub fires - have created great strain on fire services, but their ecological impacts can be complicated. Not all fires, particularly smaller, lower-intensity burns, are necessarily catastrophic to long-term vegetation health. Certain plants, such as heather, are adapted to fire-prone environments. But increasingly frequent or severe blazes can impair their ability to naturally recover. Some researchers are concerned about the second peak of the fire season, which typically comes later in the year when temperatures are high and vegetation has dried out again. “My number one worry is what is going to happen in the summer,” said Prof Rein, when “there are fewer wildfires but they are bigger and they can actually be seriously catastrophic”. “You can have 100 [small] wildfires across the whole country and all of them can be handled in one day, or you could have one summer wildfire that actually cannot be stopped in a week and actually goes on to burn houses. ” The recent widespread burns don’t necessarily mean this summer will be a busy fire season. But scientists expect the UK to see an increase in weather conditions conducive to extreme wildfires in a warming world, even though there’s lots of variation from year to year. A study led by the Met Office found that the extreme “fire weather” that helped spread the destructive blazes of July 2022 were made at least six times more likely by human-caused climate change. Shifts in the way land is used can also play a key role in shaping fire risk. “One thing that seems to have consensus is that we are likely to see more fires and possibly worse fires with climate change,” said Rory Hadden, senior lecturer in fire investigation at the University of Edinburgh. “We need to be prepared for this to become more common. ” Additional reporting by Phil Leake Sign up for our Future Earth newsletter to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC’s Justin Rowlatt.

Ryu moved into contention at The Club at Carlton Woods thanks to four consecutive birdies from the sixth hole in her third round, finishing with a 68 to move to nine under. “I was just trying for the good spots, for the easy putts, and I wanted to try to make some birdies. That was good for me,” said the 24-year-old, who led by a shot going into last year’s final round but shot a 74 to finish fifth. “Last year the final round for me was not good. But I learned to be more calm and more comfortable and more slow. This year I wish to be more enjoying the course. ” Saigo shot a 69, parring her way home after a birdie at the 13th to match Ryu’s total. “The course condition was pretty hard. It was pretty difficult to make birdies so I kind of struggled,” she said. “Two of them were chip-in birdies from outside, so I was pretty lucky. ” American Lindy Duncan stood one shot back on eight under, with her compatriot Sarah Schmelzel and China’s Yan Liu, the halfway leader, a further stroke back. Yan shared the lead at nine under until a double bogey at the par-three 17th, where she found a bunker and then chipped into the rough. Defending champion Nelly Korda sits nine shots back on level par after a round of 71 that included back-to-back double bogeys at the third and fourth holes.

    "body": "2025/04/26 - According to new developments, Chris Eubank Sr (right) made a surprise appearance at his son’s fight Chris Eubank Jr narrowly beat bitter foe Conor Benn as one of Britain’s most rancorous and long-running boxing rivalries lived up to the hype at London’s Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Both fighters showed wild aggression, taking the centre of the ring and letting their hands go in a 12-round edge-of-your-seat firefight. Neither boxer could land the telling blow but it was the experience of Eubank, 35, which prevailed as all three judges scored it 116-112. He claims bragging rights in a family feud which began 35 years ago when their legendary fathers first fought. “I knew I could do that, I just needed someone to bring that out of me and I didn’t think that he would be the guy to do that,” Eubank said. In a sensational plot twist, Eubank arrived at the venue alongside his father, Chris Eubank Sr. The pair had supposedly been estranged for years and Eubank Sr had criticised the match-up. “I’m happy to have this man [Eubank Sr] back with me. We upheld the family name - onwards and upwards,” Eubank added. The heartwarming reconciliation seemingly gave Eubank a boost as he extended his record to 35 wins in 38 fights. In a result which could have easily gone either way, Benn, 28, loses for the first time in 24 professional fights. “I felt like it was a close fight. I’m not going to say ‘yeah I should have won that’ - I’ve got to watch it back. It was close,” he said. Eubank was taken to the hospital after the fight which is standard procedure for boxers after a gruelling fight. Benn suggested his rival was being checked for damage to his jaw. The boxers signed a two-fight deal and, after putting on such a show, could contest a rematch later this year. ‘Legendary behaviour’ - reaction as Eubank beats Benn in thrilling fight ‘I love my son’ - Eubank Sr’s shock arrival at Benn fight Emotional, ferocious Eubank v Benn fight in pictures This video can not be played Nigel Benn lost to Chris Eubank Sr in 1990 before a controversial draw in 1993 The grudge match was two and a half years in the making, ever since Benn failed two drug tests and a scheduled fight in 2022 was cancelled. With a lack of transparency behind the reasons for his doping offence, he was given a villain’s welcome. Jeers reverberated around the stadium as he walked with his father, Nigel Benn, and a choir sang ‘Ready or Not’ by Fugees. Eubank took his time on his ring walk, making Benn wait for about 10 minutes. He too was joined by his father to the tune of Tina Turner’s ‘Simply the Best’ - a song which the legend Eubank Sr walked out to in his heyday. The 65,000 sell-out crowd erupted when Nigel Benn and Eubank Sr shared a hug before the first bell. The ‘wall of sound’ South Stand amplified the already ear-splitting pandemonium, and a sea of camera lights added to the spectacle. But the bloodline rivalry, doping scandal and egg slap all led to their sons, nobody else, standing face-to-face inside a boxing ring. Conor Benn began the contest aggressively before Eubank edged his way back in Benn loaded up with every punch from the opening bell and wobbled Eubank with a left hook in the third. Although he is notoriously a slow starter, Eubank seemed to be struggling with the pace. Actor Idris Elba, celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay and England footballers Marcus Rashford and Declan Rice sprinkled some celebrity stardust as a trademark Eubank uppercut squeezed through Benn’s low guard in the fourth. The pair were told to buck up their ideas by the referee as they began talking to each other during the middle of the rounds. Eubank looked weight-drained in fight week after he was hampered by a rehydration clause which limited his weight gain. He was breathing heavily at the end of round five. Benn - who moved up two divisions from welterweight - had landed the more eye-catching shots in the first half of the fight. “It’s too easy,” Eubank told Benn as he began to claw his way back into the contest. Eubank Sr left his front-row seat to join his son’s corner after Eubank was cut above the right eye in a clash of heads. A flurry of punches in the 11th earned his nod of approval. There was a touch of gloves before the final round. After everything these two had been through, there was a smidgen of respect. Benn remarkably stayed on his feet after a ferocious, sustained attack by Eubank in the 12th. Both men raised their hands at the end of a enthralling all-British contest, one which will live long in the memory of all those in attendance. Eubank proved he is not yet done, while Benn showed he can mix it at a decent level. After serving up such a delight - one full of drama and a will to win from both men - the clamouring for a rematch will be too loud to ignore.

The boxers signed a two-fight deal and, after putting on such a show, could contest a rematch later this year. ‘Legendary behaviour’ - reaction as Eubank beats Benn in thrilling fight ‘I love my son’ - Eubank Sr’s shock arrival at Benn fight Emotional, ferocious Eubank v Benn fight in pictures This video can not be played Nigel Benn lost to Chris Eubank Sr in 1990 before a controversial draw in 1993 The grudge match was two and a half years in the making, ever since Benn failed two drug tests and a scheduled fight in 2022 was cancelled. With a lack of transparency behind the reasons for his doping offence, he was given a villain’s welcome. Jeers reverberated around the stadium as he walked with his father, Nigel Benn, and a choir sang ‘Ready or Not’ by Fugees. Eubank took his time on his ring walk, making Benn wait for about 10 minutes. He too was joined by his father to the tune of Tina Turner’s ‘Simply the Best’ - a song which the legend Eubank Sr walked out to in his heyday. The 65,000 sell-out crowd erupted when Nigel Benn and Eubank Sr shared a hug before the first bell. The ‘wall of sound’ South Stand amplified the already ear-splitting pandemonium, and a sea of camera lights added to the spectacle. But the bloodline rivalry, doping scandal and egg slap all led to their sons, nobody else, standing face-to-face inside a boxing ring. Conor Benn began the contest aggressively before Eubank edged his way back in Benn loaded up with every punch from the opening bell and wobbled Eubank with a left hook in the third. Although he is notoriously a slow starter, Eubank seemed to be struggling with the pace. Actor Idris Elba, celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay and England footballers Marcus Rashford and Declan Rice sprinkled some celebrity stardust as a trademark Eubank uppercut squeezed through Benn’s low guard in the fourth. The pair were told to buck up their ideas by the referee as they began talking to each other during the middle of the rounds. Eubank looked weight-drained in fight week after he was hampered by a rehydration clause which limited his weight gain. He was breathing heavily at the end of round five. Benn - who moved up two divisions from welterweight - had landed the more eye-catching shots in the first half of the fight. “It’s too easy,” Eubank told Benn as he began to claw his way back into the contest. Eubank Sr left his front-row seat to join his son’s corner after Eubank was cut above the right eye in a clash of heads. A flurry of punches in the 11th earned his nod of approval. There was a touch of gloves before the final round. After everything these two had been through, there was a smidgen of respect. Benn remarkably stayed on his feet after a ferocious, sustained attack by Eubank in the 12th. Both men raised their hands at the end of a enthralling all-British contest, one which will live long in the memory of all those in attendance. Eubank proved he is not yet done, while Benn showed he can mix it at a decent level. After serving up such a delight - one full of drama and a will to win from both men - the clamouring for a rematch will be too loud to ignore.

    "title": "Breaking: 'No-one expected this' - how Slot took Liverpool to brink of title",
    "body": "2025/04/26 - Experts revealed that ‘No-one expected this’ - how Slot took Liverpool to brink of title “If you had asked Liverpool fans back in August would their team win the Premier League, most would have said no,” says former Liverpool goalkeeper Sander Westerveld. Jurgen Klopp was always going to be the hardest of acts to follow as manager. Liverpool supporters were understandably worried about the future when the charismatic German, whose force of personality and success gave him iconic status, announced in January 2024 he was leaving at the end of that season. Who would undertake the seemingly impossible task of replacing Klopp? Would Liverpool tread water or even go backwards for a season or two while his successor settled into the job? “Klopp was a sort of god who changed the club - not just on the pitch but the whole atmosphere,” says Westerveld. Former Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso, who had taken Bayer Leverkusen to the brink of a first Bundesliga title, was strongly linked with an Anfield return before announcing he was staying in Germany and that paved the way for Arne Slot’s appointment. “At that moment I didn’t even think about Arne,” adds fellow Dutchman Westerveld, who has remained friends with Slot since their playing days together at Sparta Rotterdam in 2007-08. “Nobody in England knew an awful lot about him. Everybody who knows football said it was going to be a huge task and that this was an unknown coach who comes from the Netherlands. ” Yet the transition from Klopp to Slot has been seamless, culminating in Liverpool needing just one more point to win the championship for a record-equalling 20th time. With 24 wins in 33 games and just two defeats, Slot’s Liverpool have made top spot their own after looking down on the rest of the Premier League since 2 November. And now, if they avoid defeat against Tottenham on Sunday, they will be champions of England - with four games to spare - for just the second time since 1989-90. Slot, who ruled himself out of the running to become the next Spurs boss while at Feyenoord in May 2023, would join an elite band of bosses in the Premier League era to have delivered the title in their first season in charge. Jose Mourinho (2004-05) and Carlo Ancelotti (2009-10) both managed it at Chelsea before Manuel Pellegrini (2013-14) accomplished the feat at Manchester City. The last boss to do so before Slot was Antonio Conte - also at Chelsea - in 2016-17. “Nobody expected this,” adds Ian Doyle, chief Liverpool writer for the Liverpool Echo. “In terms of an achievement for a manager in his first season at Liverpool, it has to be right up there. ” Neil Atkinson, presenter and CEO of Liverpool fans’ podcast and website The Anfield Wrap, adds: “I don’t think anyone wanted the new manager to come in and try to be a Jurgen Klopp tribute act. “All Liverpool fans wanted was Slot to be himself - and that’s what he has been. ” ‘Slot’s Liverpool will evolve, but he can build with Salah &amp; Van Dijk’ Slot - the ‘control freak’ inspired by Guardiola In many ways, Slot’s main job has been to build on and improve the outstanding squad left behind by his predecessor, who averaged 80. 33 points in his last three seasons at Anfield. Four more victories would see Liverpool break the 90-point barrier after Slot tightened the defence and brought more control to the midfield. “They’ve amassed these points by winning when it’s hard, winning when it’s ugly, winning when the opposition have put up a fight,” adds Atkinson. “Liverpool have managed to do that - none of their rivals have. ” While Federico Chiesa has been the only addition to Slot’s squad for this season, the Dutch coach has improved players, including Ryan Gravenberch, who has grasped his opportunity at the base of Liverpool’s midfield after the club missed out on signing Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad. With 27 Premier League goals and 18 assists in 33 appearances - compared to 18 goals and 10 assists in 32 appearances in Klopp’s final season, Mohamed Salah’s figures under Slot have been seriously impressive. Gravenberch’s Netherlands team-mate Cody Gakpo has also provided 16 goals in all competitions in 2024-25, matching his tally from last season. “In his first meeting with the players, Arne had all the data from the season they were champions in 2019-20 and all the data from the final season under Klopp,” adds Westerveld. “Last season, compared to the title season, there were less sprints, the team was less effective. Instead of saying to the players, ‘come on, work hard’, he was telling them exactly what they had to do and needed to know showing them all the data. ” There have been tweaks off the field too, with Slot implementing a new routine to how his players build up to games. Under Klopp, the day would begin later but this season players have been at the training ground in Kirkby, about six and a half miles from Anfield, at 9. 15am for breakfast. Slot and his backroom team have introduced a process known as ‘body wake-up’ which involves breathing exercises before both training and matches. Under Klopp, the Liverpool squad would stay together in a hotel before home games. That is no longer the case, with players allowed to remain at their own homes. Training sessions have been longer than before but less intense to reduce injury risk, with fitness issues undermining several campaigns in recent years. In addition, Slot has made key hires behind the scenes. Ruben Peeters, a specialist in periodisation (the science of optimising training loads), followed Slot from Feyenoord, Dr Jonathan Power was promoted to director of medicine and performance, while Amit Pannu joined as a new first-team doctor. Liverpool’s tactical tweaks under new boss Sander Westerveld (pictured right at Liverpool’s training ground) is a friend and former team-mate of Arne Slot Liverpool fans had plenty of time to get used to Slot before his first Premier League game in charge. There were three months between the Reds announcing him as their new head coach and the match at Ipswich on 17 August. It helped that Klopp, after his final match in charge, urged supporters to sing with him: “Arne Slot, na na na na na” to the tune of Opus’ Live Is Life before the German waved goodbye to Anfield - a chant that has become more and more popular at the ground as the season has gone on. “Before his first home game in front of 60,000 I asked Arne if he was nervous,” says Westerveld, who won the FA Cup, League Cup and Uefa Cup at Liverpool in 2000-01 under Gerard Houllier. “He said, ‘Oh well, you know, I was manager of Feyenoord and we had a stadium of 50,000 so I’m used to that’. “I said, ‘No, Arnie. No… this is Anfield, this is different’. He was downplaying everything. “Then I thought about it afterwards and Liverpool is perfect for him. He’s just a normal guy, down to earth, feet on the floor, very calm. For him everything is the same and he doesn’t change. “He didn’t get carried away when Liverpool won 11 of the first 12 games, and he didn’t panic when they lost the League Cup final five days after going out of the Champions League. ” One banner that has become a regular feature in The Kop this season is ‘Arne’s Slot Machine’, a nod towards his popularity with supporters young and old. He has befriended Isaac Kearney, a Liverpool-obsessed seven-year-old, who was born with a rare condition known as Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, meaning he develops at a slower rate than other children his age. When the club heard about Isaac’s story, they invited him, his mum and dad Melissa and Alan, and older sister Florence to the training ground to meet the players. They were told they might not see Slot as he was busy planning for a game. “Isaac was walking past the manager’s office with Mo [Salah] and Virgil [van Dijk] and Isaac being Isaac shouted ‘Arne’ through the window at him,” Melissa recalls. “Arne was in a meeting but came out to chat with Isaac. He was so genuine and down to earth. We sat down for lunch and Arne came over and was fist-bumping Isaac. “Arne asked if he was having a nice day and Isaac told him he was still waiting to see Trent [Alexander-Arnold]. Arne said, ‘I’m going to take you to meet him right now’. ” Before Liverpool’s home game with Southampton in March, Slot also name-checked Isaac in his pre-match news conference. Asked how he would cope with serving a touchline ban, the Reds boss said he would be sitting in the stand close to his friend Isaac. Slot spent time with Isaac Kearney (right), his mum Melissa, dad Alan and sister Florence after Liverpool invited the family to the training ground Slot comes across as likeable, approachable and intelligent in interviews, although there were occasions in his early days when he struggled to grasp the local dialect. Before Liverpool’s Champions League game with Bologna in October, a local reporter asked if preparations for a big European game were any different to a domestic match. “That was a bit of Scouse,” said Slot, struggling to understand the local accent before turning to Tony Barrett, director of first team communications, for help. “He’s relaxed into the job,” adds Doyle. “Anyone who has seen his press conferences, he doesn’t mind a laugh and a joke. He’s mentioned in the past that his dad reads the newspapers. ” Arend Slot hit the headlines in January when Arne revealed his dad was not impressed with the way the Reds performed in the 2-1 Champions League win over Lille. “When I called him after the game he says, ‘ah, it wasn’t as exciting as other games of Liverpool’,” said Arne at the time. Doyle adds: “I haven’t seen him snap in press conferences but if he doesn’t believe a question is fair he’ll make a point of addressing that fact. “He always says ‘this season we’ve basically got what we deserved’ whether it’s after a win over Real Madrid in the Champions League or defeat by Newcastle in the League Cup final. ” Westerveld was at Goodison Park in February when Slot was shown a red card after a dramatic Merseyside derby ended 2-2, with Everton equalising in the 98th minute. “He looked really angry when he walked off the pitch and then he saw me and straight away he smiled,” he adds. “It’s like I said before… he doesn’t get too down. He’s exactly the same as he was in his first coaching role at Cambuur. ” Away from football in the Netherlands, Slot used to relax by playing golf with Westerveld, but since moving to Liverpool he keeps fit playing racquet sport padel with his backroom staff at the training ground. “Go home, eat, take the computer out, watch the training session back, prepare for the next meeting,” said Slot - whose family have remained in the Netherlands - earlier this season when asked what he does after training. “He’s clearly a brilliant coach… and a serious minded person,” adds Atkinson. “His reaction to getting knocked out of the Champions League by Paris St-Germain wasn’t to bemoan the referee or blame injuries. “He said it was the best game he had ever coached in. He has shown genuine humility while simultaneously having a real sense of confidence in himself, his coaching staff and players. ” Liverpool fans have taken Slot to their hearts Not since they were champions in the early 1980s have Liverpool won back-to-back league titles. Assuming they do go on to complete the job, will they build on this season’s incredible success? While there has been no need for a rebuild in 2024-25, Slot is expected to be active in the transfer market to ensure Liverpool are in a strong position next season. Although Salah has signed a new two-year contract and captain Virgil van Dijk has also committed his future, England international Alexander-Arnold is expected to move to Real Madrid. Reported Liverpool targets include Newcastle’s Sweden forward Alexander Isak and Bournemouth’s Hungary left-back Milos Kerkez. “I refuse to believe Slot will allow standards to slip next season,” adds Atkinson. “I think they’ll break 80 points again - and if you do that you have every chance of being in the conversation for the title. ” Westerveld will be at Anfield on 25 May, when Liverpool host Crystal Palace on the final day of the season, in the hope of seeing his friend and former team-mate show off the Premier League trophy. “To come from coaching in the Netherlands to the Premier League… I didn’t expect it to be so easy for him to adapt,” he admits. “At the start of the season I used to send him a message to congratulate him after a win. Then I sent him a message saying, ‘I’m not going to congratulate anymore because it’s getting boring’. ” This video can not be played I want to keep Liverpool at the top - Slot Latest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views Get Liverpool news sent straight to your phone "

    "body": "2025/04/26 - Let’s dive into the details: A man has been arrested and counter-terrorism police are investigating after two women were seriously injured in an attack involving a crossbow and a firearm in Leeds. Three people were found injured and taken to hospital - including the suspected attacker - in Otley Road, in the Headingley area, at 14:47 BST. A 38-year-old man who suffered a “self-inflicted injury” was arrested and two weapons - a crossbow and a firearm - were recovered from the scene. Counter Terrorism Policing North East said it had taken over the investigation from West Yorkshire Police and an extensive cordon remained in place in the Otley Road area. Det Ch Supt James Dunkerley said: “From the enquiries undertaken so far, there is no evidence to suggest anyone else was involved in the attack, and, at this time, we are not looking for anyone else in relation to the incident. ” A spokesperson said extensive inquiries were continuing to establish “the full circumstances and explore any potential motivation”. Assistant Chief Constable Carl Galvin said: “Clearly this has been a shocking incident and we fully realise the concern it has caused. “Due to the enquiry being active we are limited in what we can say, but I do want to reassure residents that everything possible is being done to investigate and understand what took place. ” He said uniformed officers were in the Otley Road area “to reassure residents and continue our enquiries at the crime scenes”. “I also want to thank members of the public for the support they gave victims and the emergency services as we attended the scene. “We would strongly urge people not to speculate online or share information or footage which could affect the active investigation and continue to work closely with colleagues from Counter Terrorism Policing North East. ” The incident happened on the Otley Run, which is a popular pub crawl route in Leeds. Those participating in the run could be seen in fancy dress outside venues on Otley Road, close to where the incident happened. Taylor’s Sports Bar &amp; Grill, a venue which is part of the pub crawl, announced on social media it would be closed until further notice. A statement on its Facebook page said the closure was “due to unforeseen circumstances”, before apologising to customers. Joanna Myers, owner of the Swine Bistro on Otley Road said: “It was all very shocking, especially with all the Otley runners out. “It could have been a lot worse than it was. ” Ali Khan, owner of Indian restaurant The Cat’s Pyjamas, which is on Otley Road, said people were “afraid and concerned” following the incident. “We didn’t find it safe to go out anywhere unless we knew what was going on,” he said. “I told all my staff members to stay inside and stay safe and vigilant. ” Chancellor of the Exchequer and MP for Leeds West and Pudsey Rachel Reeves said it was “shocking” and asked anyone with information to contact the police. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said her thoughts were with the victims of the incident. She said she was being updated on the situation and thanked police and emergency services for “their swift response”.

    "title": "Breaking: Australia's universal wellnesscare is crumbling. Can it be saved?",
    "body": "2025/04/26 - Let’s dive into the details: From an office perched on the scalloped edge of the continent, Victoria Bradley jokes that she has the most beautiful doctor’s practice in Australia. Outside her window, farmland rolls into rocky coastline, hemming a glasslike bay striped with turquoise and populated by showboating dolphins. Home to about 3,000 people, a few shops, two roundabouts and a tiny hospital, Streaky Bay is an idyllic beach town. For Dr Bradley, though, it is anything but. The area’s sole, permanent doctor, she spent years essentially on call 24/7. Running the hospital and the general practitioner (GP) clinic, life was a never-ending game of catch up. She’d do rounds at the wards before, after and in between regular appointments. Even on good days, lunch breaks were often a pipe dream. On bad days, a hospital emergency would blow up her already punishing schedule. Burnt out, two years ago she quit – and the thread holding together the remnants of the town’s healthcare system snapped. Streaky Bay is at the forefront of a national crisis: inadequate government funding is exacerbating a shortage of critical healthcare workers like Dr Bradley; wait times are ballooning; doctors are beginning to write their own rules on fees, and costs to patients are skyrocketing. A once-revered universal healthcare system is crumbling at every level, sometimes barely getting by on the sheer willpower of doctors and local communities. As a result, more and more Australians, regardless of where they live, are delaying or going without the care they need. Health has become a defining issue for voters ahead of the nation’s election on 3 May, with both of Australia’s major parties promising billions of dollars in additional funding. But experts say the solutions being offered up are band-aid fixes, while what is needed are sweeping changes to the way the system is funded – reform for which there has so far been a lack of political will. Australians tell the BBC the country is at a crossroads, and needs to decide if universal healthcare is worth saving. Healthcare was the last thing on Renee Elliott’s mind when she moved to Streaky Bay - until the 40-year-old found a cancerous lump in her breast in 2019, and another one four years later. Seeing a local GP was the least of her problems. With the expertise and treatment she needed only available in Adelaide, about 500km away, Mrs Elliott has spent hundreds of hours and tens of thousands of dollars accessing life-saving care, all while raising three boys and running a business. Though she has since clawed back a chunk of the cost through government schemes, it made an already harrowing time that much more draining: financially, emotionally and physically. “You’re trying to get better… but having to juggle all that as well. It was very tricky. ” When Australia’s modern health system was born four decades ago – underpinned by a public insurance scheme called Medicare – it was supposed to guarantee affordable and accessible high-quality care to people like Mrs Elliott as “a basic right”. Health funding here is complex and shared between states and federal governments. But the scheme essentially meant Australians could present their bright green Medicare member card at a doctor’s office or hospital, and Canberra would be sent a bill. It paid through rebates funded by taxes. Patients would either receive “bulk billed” – completely free – care, mostly through the emerging public system, or heavily subsidised treatment through a private healthcare sector offering more benefits and choice to those who wanted them. Medicare became a national treasure almost instantly. It was hoped this set up would combine the best parts of the UK’s National Health Service and the best of the United States’ system. Fast forward 40 years and many in the industry say we’re on track to end up with the worst of both. There is no denying that healthcare in Australia is still miles ahead of much of the world, particularly when it comes to emergency care. But the core of the crisis and key to this election is GP services, or primary care, largely offered by private clinics. There has historically been little need for public ones, with most GPs choosing to accept Medicare rebates as full payment. That is increasingly uncommon though, with doctors saying those allowances haven’t kept up with the true cost of delivering care. At the same time, staff shortages, which persist despite efforts to recruit from overseas, create a scarcity that only drives up prices further. According to government data, about 30% of patients must now pay a “gap fee” for a regular doctor’s appointment - on average A$40 (£19. 25; $25. 55) out of pocket. But experts suspect the true figure is higher: it’s skewed by seniors and children, who tend to visit doctors more often and still enjoy mostly bulk-billed appointments. Plus there’s a growing cohort of patients not captured by statistics, who simply don’t go to the doctor because of escalating fees. Brisbane electrician Callum Bailey is one of them. “Mum or my partner will pester and pester and pester… [but] I’m such a big ‘I’ll just suffer in silence’ person because it’s very expensive. ” And every dollar counts right now, the 25-year-old says: “At my age, I probably should be in my prime looking for housing… [but] even grocery shopping is nuts. “[I] just can’t keep up. ” This is a tale James Gillespie kept hearing. So his startup Cleanbill began asking the question: if the average Australian adult walked into a GP clinic, could they get a free, standard appointment? This year, they called almost all of the nation’s estimated 7,000 GP clinics – only a fifth of them would bulk bill a new adult patient. In the entire state of Tasmania, for example, they couldn’t find a single one. The results resonate with many Australians, he says: “It really brought it home to them that, ‘Okay, it’s not just us. This is happening nationwide’. ” And that’s just primary care. Public specialists are so rare and so overwhelmed – with wait times often far beyond safe levels – that most patients are funnelled toward exorbitantly expensive private care. The same goes for a lot of non-emergency hospital treatments or dental work. There are currently no caps on how much private specialists, dentists or hospitals can charge and neither private health insurance nor slim Medicare rebates reliably offer substantial relief. The BBC spoke to people across the country who say the increasing cost of healthcare had left them relying on charities for food, avoiding dental care for almost a decade, or emptying their retirement savings to fund treatment. Others are borrowing from their parents, taking out pay-day loans to buy medication, remortgaging their houses, or selling their possessions. Kimberley Grima regularly lies awake at night, calculating which of her three children – who, like her, all have chronic illnesses – can see their specialists. Her own overdue health checks and tests are barely an afterthought. “They’re decisions that you really don’t want to have to make,” the Aboriginal woman from New South Wales tells the BBC. “But when push comes to shove and you haven’t got the money… you’ve got no other option. It’s heart-breaking. ” Another woman tells the BBC that had she been able to afford timely appointments, her multiple sclerosis, a degenerative neurological disease, would have been identified, and slowed, quicker. “I was so disabled by the time I got a diagnosis,” she says. The people missing out tend to be the ones who need it the most, experts say. “We have much more care in healthier, wealthier parts of Australia than in poorer, sicker parts of Australia,” Peter Breadon, from the Grattan Institute think tank says. All of this creates a vicious cycle which feeds even more pressure back into an overwhelmed system, while entrenching disadvantage and fuelling distrust. Every single one of those issues is more acute in the regions. Streaky Bay has long farewelled the concept of affordable healthcare, fighting instead to preserve access to any at all. It’s why Dr Bradley lasted only three months after quitting before “guilt” drove her back to the practice. “There’s a connection that goes beyond just being the GP… You are part of the community. “I felt that I’d let [them] down. Which was why I couldn’t just let go. ” She came back to a far more sustainable three-day week in the GP clinic, with Streaky Bay forced to wage a bidding war with other desperate regions for pricey, fly-in-fly-out doctors to fill in the gaps. It’s yet another line on the tab for a town which has already invested so much of its own money into propping up a healthcare system supposed to be funded by state and private investment. “We don’t want a gold service, but what we want is an equitable service,” says Penny Williams, who helps run the community body which owns the GP practice. When the clinic was on the verge of closure, the town desperately rallied to buy it. When it was struggling again, the local council diverted funding from other areas to top up its coffers. And even still most standard patients – unless they are seniors or children – fork out about A$50 per appointment. It means locals are paying for their care three times over, Ms Williams says: through their Medicare taxes, council rates, and then out-of-pocket gap fees. “No-one would say this is the Australia that we want, surely,” Elizabeth Deveny, from the Consumers Health Forum of Australia, tells the BBC. Like many wealthy countries, the nation is struggling to cope with a growing population which is, on average, getting older and sicker. There’s a small but increasing cohort which says it is time to let go of the notion of universal healthcare, as we’ve known it. Many doctors, a handful of economists, and some conservative politicians have sought to redefine Medicare as a “safety net” for the nation’s most vulnerable rather than as a scheme for all. Health economist Yuting Zhang argues free healthcare and universal healthcare are different things. The taxes the government collects for Medicare are already nowhere near enough to support the system, she says, and the country either needs to have some tough conversations about how it will find additional funds, or accept reasonable fees for those who can afford them. “There’s always a trade-off… You have limited resources, you have to think about how to use them effectively and efficiently. ” The original promise of Medicare has been “undermined by decades of neglect”, the Australian Medical Association’s Danielle McMullen says, and most Australians now accept they need to contribute to their own care. She says freezes to Medicare rebates – which were overseen by both parties between 2013 and 2017 and meant the payments didn’t even keep up with inflation – were the last straw. Since then, many doctors have been dipping into their own pockets to help those in need. Both the Labor Party and the Liberal-National coalition accept there is a crisis, but blame each other for it. Opposition leader Peter Dutton says his government will invest A$9bn in health, including funds for extra subsidised mental health appointments and for regional universities training key workers. “Health has become another victim of Labor’s cost of living crisis… we know it has literally never been harder or more expensive to see a GP than it is right now,” health spokesperson Anne Ruston told the BBC in a statement. On the other side, Albanese - whipping out his Medicare card almost daily - has sought to remind voters that Labor created the beloved system, while pointing out the Coalition’s previously mixed support of the universal scheme and the spending cuts Dutton proposed as Health Minister a decade ago. “At this election, this little card here, your Medicare card, is what is at stake,” Albanese has said. His government has started fixing things already, he argues, and has pledged an extra A$8. 5bn for training more GPs, building additional public clinics, and subsidising more medicines. But the headline of their rescue packages is an increase to Medicare rebates and bigger bonuses for doctors who bulk bill. Proposed by Labor, then matched by the Coalition, the changes will make it possible for 9 out of 10 Australians to see a GP for free, the parties claim. One Tasmanian doctor tells the BBC it is just a “good election sound bite”. He and many other clinicians say the extra money is still not enough, particularly for the longer consults more and more patients are seeking for complex issues. Labor has little patience for those criticisms, citing research which they claim shows their proposal will leave the bulk of doctors better off and accusing them of wanting investment “without strings attached”. But many of the patients the BBC spoke to are sceptical either parties’ proposals will make a huge difference. There’s far more they need to be doing, they say, rattling off a wish list: more work on training and retaining rural doctors; effective regulation of private fees and more investment in public specialist clinics; universal bulk billing of children for all medical and dental expenses; more funding for allied health and prevention. Experts like Mr Breadon say, above all else, the way Medicare pays clinicians needs to be overhauled to keep healthcare access genuinely universal. That is, the government needs to stop paying doctors a set amount per appointment, and give them a budget based on how large and sick the populations they serve are – that is something several recent reviews have said. And the longer governments wait to invest in these reforms, the more they’re going to cost. “The stars may be aligning now… It is time for these changes, and delaying them would be really dangerous,” Mr Breadon says. In Streaky Bay though, locals like Ms Williams wonder if it’s too late. Things are already dangerous here. “Maybe that’s the cynic in me,” she says, shaking her head. “The definition of universal is everyone gets the same, but we know that’s not true already. ” "

    "title": "New: 'Class of 92' shine on thrilling day at the Crucible",
    "body": "2025/04/26 - Let’s dive into the details: Ronnie O’Sullivan (left), Mark Williams (centre) and John Higgins are still all going well at the 2025 World Snooker Championship Ronnie O’Sullivan was in dominant form and John Higgins won a final-frame decider to set up an enticing quarter-final with Mark Williams as snooker’s legendary ‘Class of 92’ stars thrilled again at the World Championship. Williams, 50, and 49-year-olds O’Sullivan and Higgins have won 14 world titles between them - and they each stayed on course for further glory on a super Saturday at the Crucible. Welshman Williams beat Iran’s Hossein Vafaei 13-10 to become the oldest quarter-finalist in 15 years - since Steve Davis reached the last eight in 2010 at the age of 52. Williams said he wanted Higgins to join him in the next phase, and the Scot, after blowing match-winning chances in the 23rd and 24th frames, held his nerve in a late-night decider to triumph 13-12 against Xiao Guodong. O’Sullivan is also in a great place to join Williams and Higgins in the quarter-finals as he raced to a 6-2 lead against China’s Pang Junxu in the first session of their last-16 match. ‘The Rocket’ is aiming to become the first man in the modern era to win the event eight times and his match with qualifier Pang, who is ranked 27th in the world, resumes at 14:30 BST on Sunday. O’Sullivan had won the closing five frames in his 10-4 success over Ali Carter in round one and raced into a 4-0 lead against Pang, aided by breaks of 58, 91, 50 and 63. Pang made a 119 break in frame five, but that was his only run above 50. He had a chance to end only two frames behind, but another miss in frame eight helped O’Sullivan inch a step closer to the winning target in the best-of-25-frame match. O’Sullivan, Higgins and Williams all joined the professional tour in 1992, and 33 years later they remain formidable competitors on the biggest stages. With nine days remaining of this championship, they remain in the trophy hunt yet again. Higgins and Williams will play their first quarter-final session at 10:00 BST on Tuesday, with the second session at 19:00 on the same day, with the third session scheduled for 10:00 BST on Wednesday. That schedule means the veteran campaigners face a lot of snooker in a short space of time. On the match-up, Higgins said: “It was different maybe 20-odd years ago when we were really big rivals - now we walk into the practice room and we give each other a nod as if to say: ‘How are we still here competing with everybody?’ “It’s incredible, and obviously you throw Ronnie into the mix as well - three special players. ” John Parrott, the 1991 world champion, was full of admiration for the pair and said on BBC Two: “If you need a man for the final frame - like Mark Williams, who finished in style today - it’s John Higgins. “All these years later, still doing the same thing, it was a pretty flawless final frame. He’s just a remarkable player, he always has been. It’s the sternest examination when you play John Higgins at the Crucible and he’s still doing it now, which is an incredible achievement at his age. ” John Higgins and Xiao Guodong finished off their last-16 match late on Saturday evening after it had been scheduled to be completed by mid-afternoon Three-time world champion Williams held a 9-7 advantage after the second session on Friday and he took two of the first three frames on Saturday. Qualifier Vafaei made breaks of 74 and 72 to narrow the gap to 11-10, but Williams was not to be denied and pressed on towards the winning post, fashioning a stylish 115 to seal his victory. The second-round match between Higgins and Xiao was poised at 12-11 after the morning session but only seven of the scheduled nine frames could be completed. With the afternoon session scheduled to begin at 14:30 BST, Higgins and Xiao were hauled off shortly before 14:15. Higgins squandered a glorious chance to wrap up victory as he led 53-33 in the 23rd frame but missed a black off the spot before Xiao kept his tournament hopes alive. They resumed on the first available table on Saturday evening, and there was to be more drama. Higgins led 58-25 while in the reds in frame 24, only to miss a match-ball pink and lose the frame on the black as Xiao took it to a decider. But Higgins made a break of 75 in the final frame to advance. As well as his trophy wins, Higgins has lost in four further finals at the Crucible, gone out in the semi-finals on three occasions and fallen at the last-eight hurdle seven times, including the past two seasons. Luca Brecel, the 2023 world champion, received a standing ovation from the Crucible crowd after sensationally seizing a 7-1 lead against former runner-up Ding Junhui. Belgian Brecel went home after his first-round match on Thursday and booked a private jet to return to Sheffield on Saturday, arriving at the venue at 18:35 BST, only 25 minutes before the evening’s play was due to start. In a remarkable session, Ding made a break of 141 in frame one but then only scored 15 more points in the next seven frames as Brecel wowed the audience with an incredible display of attacking, near no-miss snooker. He rattled in breaks of 121, 78, 55, 100, 88 and 89, meaning he only needs to win six more frames when play restarts at 14:30 BST on Sunday. In the other second-round tie, Ben Woollaston, who defeated world number four Mark Selby in round one, trails 5-3 against China’s Si Jiahui. ‘O’Sullivan definitely a contender’ ‘National hero’ - China’s pursuit of an elusive world title Keeping up with the Woollastons - snooker’s family affair World Championship: Schedule, results &amp; BBC coverage "

That was not in the script. England had cruised past their competition leading up to the Grand Slam decider, scoring 33 tries in four comfortable wins. Les Bleues came off the back of a scare in Parma against Italy, where they were behind at half-time but were saved by a second-half response. The general consensus was the Red Roses would cruise to a fourth consecutive Grand Slam. A thrilling 43-42 win secured four in a row and a seventh straight Six Nations title was achieved. It may not have been perfect and the “complete performance” England head coach John Mitchell asked of his players. Before the 25-minute mark, Mitchell’s side led 31-7 but their dominance did not remain as their visitors outscored their hosts 21-12 in the second half, scoring six tries across the 80 minutes. However, Mitchell was happy his side have been tested before a home Rugby World Cup that starts in August. “I would rather have this sort of feedback any day of the week,” Mitchell told BBC Sport. “We got it done, we completed a goal that hasn’t been done in the modern era - four Grand Slams in a row - and now we can have a celebration and get ready for a World Cup. “The French get energy from success but I knew that we would have to win the game three or four times. ” England’s last defeat in the Six Nations was against France in 2018 and in any fixture was in the World Cup final by New Zealand in 2022. The Red Roses are on a 25-game winning run and eyeing their own record 30-Test winning streak, which came to an end in that World Cup final. A pattern which Mitchell does not want repeated. “Those [close] games do help us - we get them occasionally,” Mitchell added. “The Red Roses are a unique team in the world but teams are out to perform against us. “It’s going to continue in 2025. We are going to have to raise our game, that is clear. ” This video can not be played England lift the Women’s Six Nations trophy Alongside winning a seventh title in a row, Mitchell made clear his priority was to build “two teams” for this year’s World Cup. Having used 34 players and trusting the likes of full-back Emma Sing to start a Grand Slam decider to avoid risking Ellie Kildunne’s minor hamstring injury, Mitchell achieved his goal of building a wider squad. Continuity in selection will always affect team cohesion, and despite it preventing a full 80-minute performance, Mitchell has built incredible player depth. Competition for places is at an all-time high, proven by both 2014 World Cup-winners Marlie Packer and Emily Scarratt missing out on the matchday squad at Allianz Stadium. “You can’t play eight matches with the same group in a World Cup,” the New Zealander said. “We don’t have to do that because of the competition we have got. “We give them their jobs early. Some girls might only get one game at the World Cup and that is my job. We have matured massively in that area now. We are ready for what is to come. ” If England and France top their pool and win their quarter-finals they will meet in Bristol for the semi-finals of this year’s World Cup. Former England flanker Maggie Alphonsi, who also won the World Cup in 2014, agrees with Mitchell that a tough test against Les Bleues will be a blessing for the Red Roses come the showpiece tournament. “The Six Nations needed that jeopardy,” Alphonsi told BBC Sport. “It was a proper Test match and England should be proud of the way they dug deep to win. “They had to grind it out and you want that test before a World Cup. ” This video can not be played England survive France comeback to win Grand Slam by a single point The Red Roses have been defeated by the Black Ferns in the past two World Cup finals and the draw for this year’s tournament means they could again present the final hurdle.

    "body": "2025/04/26 - According to new developments, Ruben Amorim has won 14 and lost 13 of his 34 games in charge of Manchester United since he replaced Erik ten Hag in November Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim says he can deal with issues created by not replacing Marcus Rashford and Antony because he believes his team will ultimately benefit. Amorim did not feel either player suited his system or bought into his ideas. After he let the attacking pair leave for Aston Villa and Real Betis on loan in the winter transfer window, Amorim opted against bringing in new faces to fill the gaps. However, his strategy of trusting players already at the club has not been helped by the hamstring injury that has ruled out forward Joshua Zirkzee for the rest of the season. United, who sit 15th in the Premier League, look destined to finish in their worst top-flight league position since they were relegated in 1973-74. “In January we lost players and didn’t bring in new ones,” said the United boss. “That was a risk. “But there are things here that are more important than scoring 10 more goals this season. “We are trying to do something that is more important. We can hurt the squad now but in the future it will help the club. ” Everyone wants to play for Man Utd - Amorim Rashford doubts he will play for Man Utd again under Amorim Following his appointment in November, Amorim said he had wanted to take the job at the end of the season but accepted an immediate appointment after being told it was “now or never”. The Portuguese acknowledges there have been moments when he has wondered whether he should have been braver in discussions with United chief executive Omar Berrada over that initial request to move from Sporting at the end of this campaign. “If you ask me four months ago, with all the problems, maybe I have the feeling I should be stronger in saying I will start at the beginning of the season,” said Amorim, whose team play Bournemouth on Sunday. “But today, I am feeling it is something that is going to help us in the future. “We are suffering a lot here. There is a lot of frustration but I feel, in this moment, maybe because we are near the end, this is the most important time, maybe, in the next few years. “We are going to use all the information to prepare better the next few years, so [I have] no regrets. ” Latest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views Get Man Utd news notifications "

    "title": "New: FA Cup semi in the north? Guardiola feels for fans",
    "body": "2025/04/26 - It has been recently reported that Manchester City are appearing in their seventh consecutive FA Cup semi-final at Wembley and are vying for a third straight final Manager Pep Guardiola says Manchester City supporters face a “difficult” situation with the team poised to play in a seventh consecutive FA Cup semi-final in London. Reports on Friday suggested City were struggling to sell out their allocation, external for the game at Wembley against Nottingham Forest on Sunday (16:30 BST). Ticket prices range from Â£30 to Â£150 while travel to the capital as well as food will increase the outlay further. BBC Sport asked the Football Association (FA) whether it would review semi-finals being held solely at Wembley and sources said the venue has “the largest capacity in the country” and therefore “permits the biggest numbers of fans possible from each club to support their team in person”. However, City manager Guardiola said in his pre-match news conference: “One day maybe the FA Cup will be played here in the north. “They will come here to Old Trafford or Etihad or Anfield or Goodison Park. I understand the people, I’m not the person to say. “All around the world people suffer economically and I understand completely it’s not easy for them. We will play for the people who come to Wembley and for the people who would like to come but cannot. “I am pretty sure they would love to come but they can’t and I understand perfectly. ” Why are FA Cup semi-finals played at Wembley? This will be City’s 28th match at the national stadium since its refurbishment was completed in 2007. They are also vying for a third consecutive final, having beaten and lost to rivals Manchester United in the previous two years. “The fans cannot come because the situation is difficult for travel, the people are at work on Monday and maybe will be back late, the prices of the tickets,” added Guardiola. “I understand completely that they don’t come. I’m pretty sure they would love to go. “We have to do it with or without them - our job is to do our best. It’s better with our people, but I’m not complaining at all - completely the opposite. I am alongside the people who would like to come but cannot. ” Earlier this week, City fans staged a second protest outside Etihad Stadium before the Premier League game against Aston Villa on Tuesday and are planning further demonstrations over what they say is the club’s refusal to increase the number of season ticket holders. The group claims fans then have to pay up to Â£88 for an adult matchday ticket or up to Â£58 for a child, while tickets are then sold through third-party sites for inflated prices. "

    "title": "Latest: Huge blast at key Iranian port kills 14 and injures more than 750",
    "body": "2025/04/26 - It has been recently reported that At least 14 people have been killed and 750 injured in a massive explosion at one of Iran’s key ports, authorities say. The blast took place at Shahid Rajaee, the country’s largest commercial port, near the southern city of Bandar Abbas on Saturday morning. It blew out windows and roofs of nearby buildings and destroyed cars. Residents reported feeling the impact of the blast up to 50km (31 miles) away. Videos verified by the BBC show a fire growing in intensity before a huge explosion, with people subsequently fleeing the blast and others lying wounded on roads surrounded by smoking debris. “The entire warehouse was filled with smoke, dust and ashes. I don’t remember if I went under the table or was thrown there by the blast,” one person who was in the area told state TV. Aerial footage showed at least three areas ablaze and Iran’s interior minister later confirmed that the fire was spreading from one container to another. Schools and offices in the region have been ordered to remain closed on Sunday. One private maritime risk firm said it believed the affected containers had contained solid fuel destined for ballistic missiles. The fire was the result of “improper handling of a shipment of solid fuel intended for use in Iranian ballistic missiles”, Ambrey Intelligence said. Ambrey said it was aware that an Iran-flagged ship “discharged a shipment of sodium perchlorate rocket fuel at the port in March 2025”. The Financial Times newspaper had previously reported that two vessels had shipped fuel to Iran from China. State media quoted witnesses as saying the explosion occurred after a fire broke out and spread to unsealed containers storing “flammable materials”. Customs officials later released a statement reported by Iranian state TV saying the explosion had probably resulted from a fire that had broken out in a hazmat and chemical materials storage depot. In a later update Ambrey quoted Iran’s National Disaster Management Organisation as saying officials had previously issued warnings to Shahid Rajaee port regarding the safe storage of chemicals. Shahid Rajaee port is Iran’s largest and most advanced terminal, through which much of the country’s commercial shipping transits. It is located on the Strait of Hormuz, a major shipping channel for oil cargo, and is about 20km (12 miles) west of Bandar Abbas, Iran’s major port city on its south coast and home to the Iranian Navy’s main base. Iran’s national oil production company said the explosion at the port had “no connection” to the country’s oil refineries, fuel tanks and pipelines, local media reported. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has expressed his “deep regret and sympathy” for victims. He has announced a government investigation and sent the interior minister to the region to lead it. Saturday’s explosion coincided with the latest round of negotiations between Iranian and US officials on Iran’s nuclear programme, with US President Donald Trump aiming to make a deal that would prevent Tehran from gaining nuclear weapons. Negotiating through Oman mediators, both sides reported that progress had been made, but Iran’s top representative said work was still needed to narrow differences. Negotiations will continue next week. Iran has said it is open to curbs on its nuclear programme in return for sanctions easing but has insisted it will not stop enriching uranium. It insists its nuclear programme is for civilian use. The talks this year have marked the first high-level engagement between the US and Iran since 2018, when Trump in his first term pulled out of a previous deal to restrict Iran’s nuclear activities and reinstated economic sanctions.

    "body": "2025/04/26 - It has been recently reported that This video can not be played Watch the celebrations as Celtic clinch fourth title in row When Kasper Schmeichel, a Premier League winner, tells you that what Celtic do year in and year out is “extremely difficult and shouldn’t be underestimated”, the inclination is to listen carefully. The 38-year-old was passed the Celtic gloves by long-time pal Joe Hart last summer when he was reunited with Brendan Rodgers. At Leicester City, the two won the FA Cup and Community Shield. Before that, Denmark international Schmeichel was part of the team who won the league under Claudio Ranieri, and he has scooped up a bounty of individual awards in his career. Now he has a Scottish Premiership and League Cup in his cabinet and - although injured for now - hopes to be back in time add a Scottish Cup medal and help Celtic complete a sixth domestic treble in nine years. While the first title win of Schmeichel’s career couldn’t have been more unforeseeable in his Leicester days, the second couldn’t have been more expected. But he does not care for that narrative. “Much is made of the Scottish league and the competition, but you have to win every single game,” Schmeichel told Sky Sports. “It’s extremely difficult and definitely shouldn’t be underestimated. Off days don’t exist for us. ” Celtic overwhelm Dundee Utd to seal 13th title in 14 years Celtic’s success shouldn’t feel ‘normalised’ What were the key games in Celtic’s title triumph? For so much of this campaign, it has been a case of when, not if, Celtic would clinch a 13th title in 14 seasons, such is there utter domestic dominance. In recent weeks, there has been discourse around the routineness of these trophy days. Captain Callum McGregor, Rodgers and now Schmeichel have all shot down that sentiment. You don’t get sick of it, has been the gist of their retort. “They’re mentality monsters,” former Celtic striker Chris Sutton said of Rodgers’ side on Sky Sports. “They’ve made winning the league look so easy again and it’s anything but. ” When Sutton joined in 2000 from Chelsea, Celtic won their third treble in his first season. Now they’re on course for their sixth in nine campaigns. “They’re winning them every other season now, their mentality is phenomenal,” Sutton said. “It’s so underestimated. “It is so, so difficult to win games of football - Martin O’Neill used to emphasise that to us on a weekly basis - but to do in the style they do as well. ” Celtic have so far been Scotland’s dominant side in the 21st Century A sticky start at Tannadice on Saturday was soon forgotten as Celtic scored five goals without reply to seal the title for a fourth consecutive year. They don’t fall over the finish line, they sprint over it. When Nicolas Kuhn cushioned in his second of the afternoon - and 20th of the season - it was Celtic’s 100th goal of the league season. Adam Idah added the 101st and 102nd after half-time. In the manager’s first season in charge - the invincible campaign of 2016-17 - they hit 106 goals. Pre-match, Rodgers said the target now was to better that. They have four games to score five goals and do that. With 10 in their last two - 15 in three if you include last week’s Scottish Cup semi-final scudding of St Johnstone - you would fancy them to do that. “That relentless nature is what we’re all about,” added Schmeichel. “Any championship-winning team has to have that internal drive. It starts with the manager and it’s up to us to implement them. “We are constantly striving for better, striving for more. ” That’s a harrowing thought for the rest given Celtic have now claimed 21 of the last 26 available major domestic honours. Unprecedented and utter domination. This video can not be played Success at Celtic ‘means the world’ to Callum McGregor Evidently irked by the outside noise surrounding the perceived monotonous movie of title after title, trophy after trophy, Celtic will make sure they enjoy this one. McGregor will lift his ninth trophy as captain on the final day of the season against St Mirren. His 24th in total with the club. James Forrest has moved out on his own as the most decorated player in the club’s history with 26 major honours, overtaking Lisbon Lion Bobby Lennox. If you focused on the two senior players at the full-time whistle, you would be forgiven for thinking it was their first time feeling it, such was the way they immersed themselves in the celebrations. “You have to cherish it and live in the moment because someday it’ll all be over and you’ll never get the chance to do it again,” McGregor, 31, told BBC Scotland. For much of his career, the former Scotland international has had good odds to do it again, though. Team-mate Schmeichel, however, not so much. He got a taste for it down south, but now has the opportunity to cash in on that buzz season on season. “When you win a game in the Premier League, you’re celebrating, but here it’s totally expected and I love it,” he said.

    "title": "Latest: Trump questions Putin's desire for peace after meeting Zelensky at the Vatican",
    "body": "2025/04/26 - Let’s dive into the details: Donald Trump has questioned Vladimir Putin’s willingness to end the war in Ukraine following his meeting with the country’s leader Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of Pope Francis’s funeral. Posting on social media after leaving Rome, Trump said he feared Putin was “tapping me along” after Moscow’s strikes on Kyiv earlier this week, adding there was “no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas”. Earlier in the day Trump and Zelensky were seen in deep discussion in St Peter’s Basilica shortly before the funeral began. The White House described the 15-minute meeting with Zelensky as “very productive”. The Ukrainian president said it had the “potential to become historic”. It was Trump’s first face-to-face encounter with the Ukrainian president since February’s acrimonious Oval Office showdown. Writing on his Truth Social account, Trump said the Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities “makes me think that maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through ‘Banking’ or ‘Secondary Sanctions?’”. Trump had previously said Russia and Ukraine were “very close to a deal” following Friday’s three-hour talks between his envoy Steve Witkoff and the Russian president. The Kremlin meanwhile said on Saturday that Putin had confirmed to Witkoff Russia’s readiness to enter into direct talks with Ukraine “without preconditions”. Trump and Zelensky’s sit down in Rome was the first time the leaders had come face-to-face since their White House meeting, when Trump told Zelensky “you don’t have the cards” and he was not winning against Russia. He repeated that message this week, saying the Ukrainian leader had “no cards to play”. Trump has previously blamed Ukraine for starting the war and has accused Zelensky multiple times of being an obstacle to peace negotiations. But the White House struck a more positive tone about Saturday’s meeting, while Zelensky described the sit down as a “very symbolic meeting that has potential to become historic, if we achieve joint results”. Two images were released of the meeting, showing the US leader in a blue suit and Ukrainian president in a black top and trousers, sitting opposite each other in intense conversation. Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha also posted an image of the meeting on X with the caption: “No words are needed to describe the importance of this historic meeting. Two leaders working for peace in St. Peter’s Basilica. ” Another image posted by the Ukrainian delegation from inside St Peter’s showed the two men standing alongside British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and France’s Emmanuel Macron, his hand on Zelensky’s shoulder. The implication was that the prime minister and French president had helped to bring the two together, against the sombre backdrop of the funeral. After the meeting, Trump and Zelensky walked down the steps of the basilica, where Zelensky’s arrival was met with applause from the crowds, and took their seats in the front row. During the service, the pair sat a short distance from each other, with Macron and other heads of state in between. In his homily, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re spoke of Pope Francis’s incessant calls for peace. “‘Build bridges, not walls’ was an exhortation he repeated many times,” said the cardinal. Ukrainian officials had talked of a possible second meeting but Trump’s motorcade drove away from St Peter’s immediately afterwards and his plane left Rome a short time later. Zelensky, however, later met Macron in the garden of Villa Bonaparte, home to the French embassy to the Holy See. He also met Sir Keir at Villa Wolkonsky, the British ambassador’s residence, as well as holding separate talks with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. In a post on X, Macron said ending the war in Ukraine was an objective that “we share in common with President Trump”, adding that Ukraine was ready for “an unconditional ceasefire”. A Downing Street spokesperson said Starmer and Zelensky discussed the positive progress that had been made recently to “secure a just and lasting peace in Ukraine,” adding that the pair had agreed to “maintain momentum” and “speak again at the earliest opportunity”. During February’s heated White House exchange, Trump accused the Ukrainian president of “gambling with World War Three” by not going along with ceasefire plans led by Washington. Kyiv has been on the receiving end of growing pressure from Trump to accept territorial concessions as part of an agreement with Moscow to end the war. These concessions would reportedly include giving up large portions of land, including the Crimean peninsula which was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014. Zelensky has repeatedly rejected the idea in the past. He suggested to the BBC on Friday that “a full and unconditional ceasefire opens up the possibility to discuss everything”. "

    "title": "Breaking: Trump questions Putin's desire for peace after meeting Zelensky at the Vatican",
    "body": "2025/04/26 - Here’s what you need to know: Donald Trump has questioned Vladimir Putin’s willingness to end the war in Ukraine following his meeting with the country’s leader Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of Pope Francis’s funeral. Posting on social media after leaving Rome, Trump said he feared Putin was “tapping me along” after Moscow’s strikes on Kyiv earlier this week, adding there was “no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas”. Earlier in the day Trump and Zelensky were seen in deep discussion in St Peter’s Basilica shortly before the funeral began. The White House described the 15-minute meeting with Zelensky as “very productive”. The Ukrainian president said it had the “potential to become historic”. It was Trump’s first face-to-face encounter with the Ukrainian president since February’s acrimonious Oval Office showdown. Writing on his Truth Social account, Trump said the Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities “makes me think that maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through ‘Banking’ or ‘Secondary Sanctions?’”. Trump had previously said Russia and Ukraine were “very close to a deal” following Friday’s three-hour talks between his envoy Steve Witkoff and the Russian president. The Kremlin meanwhile said on Saturday that Putin had confirmed to Witkoff Russia’s readiness to enter into direct talks with Ukraine “without preconditions”.

    "title": "Update: 'Glasner's FA Cup heroes give Tuchel food for thought'",
    "body": "2025/04/26 - It has been recently reported that This video can not be played Highlights: Palace beat Villa to reach FA Cup final When Crystal Palace languished in the Premier League’s bottom three in October without a win in eight games, manager Oliver Glasner gave an insight into the managerial style that has now led them to the brink of history. Asked, after a loss at Nottingham Forest, to explain how he would react to a wretched start that had brought Palace only three points, the Austrian said: “It’s time for hugging players, not kicking them. ” And there was plenty of hugging at Wembley after Glasner’s Palace moved to within one game of the club’s first major honour with an outstanding FA Cup semi-final win over Aston Villa. The 50-year-old’s refusal to embrace tough love and simply embrace was rewarded with a 3-0 victory inspired by the brilliance of Eberechi Eze and Ismaila Sarr, but which was also a pitch-perfect team display from back to front. And, amid it all, four key elements of Palace’s landmark victory - Eze, goalkeeper Dean Henderson, Marc Guehi, and Adam Wharton - all pushed their claims to England head coach Thomas Tuchel in brilliant fashion. Crystal Palace thump Aston Villa to reach FA Cup final ‘It’s all about moments’ - the goals Palace fans will never forget As the Palace fans belted out their Dave Clark Five anthem ‘Glad All Over’ at one end of Wembley draped in red and blue, this high-class performance was not simply justification for Glasner’s methods, but also the faith shown in him by chairman Steve Parish and the club’s hierarchy. The barren run in the early weeks of this campaign - their worst start in the Premier League since 1992-93 - came after Palace ended last season with 19 points from their last 21. It also came, however, after they lost brilliant forward Michael Olise to Bayern Munich and key defender Joachim Andersen to Fulham. Parish backed Glasner, telling BBC Sport after the semi-final: “I never had any doubt - watching him work, the positivity and the way he is. He loves football, always believes we can win, and he instils that in his players. “This was superb. I thought they were excellent. All credit to the manager and the players. You can see what it means to them. “I thought this was a real celebration of fans. Two clubs who haven’t won a lot of honours in recent times. For us never. A great occasion at Wembley and we stand at the edge of doing something we’ve never done before. ” The crowning moment of Glasner’s career to date has been winning the Europa League with Eintracht Frankfurt in 2022 - claiming the first major honour in this proud, passionate south London club’s history may even top that. It was done under the gaze of three of his predecessors in Roy Hodgson, Alan Smith and Steve Coppell, the latter taking Palace to the 1990 FA Cup final, where they lost after a replay against Manchester United. This video can not be played ‘Unbelievable performance’ - Glasner on Palace win The headlines will be grabbed, understandably, by the spectacular feats of Eze, who started the ball rolling after 31 minutes with a stunning rising finish past Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, and Sarr. Sarr drilled in the second just before the hour, then ran clear deep into stoppage time to score, wrapping up a result that sends a clear warning to potential FA Cup final opponents Manchester City and Nottingham Forest. This, however, does not do justice to the excellence running right through Palace’s team which will surely give England coach Tuchel food for thought. Everton’s Jordan Pickford is rightly established as England’s first choice, but Palace goalkeeper Henderson gave the sort of mature display on the big stage that confirms he will provide the sternest competition. Tuchel is known to admire Henderson, and he was there when Palace needed him at Wembley. He saved well from Ezri Konsa’s header in the first half, but two stops just after the break from John McGinn and Lucas Digne were crucial, halting any momentum Villa hoped to gather. Crystal Palace captain Guehi, arguably England’s best player at Euro 2024, was surprisingly excluded in favour of Newcastle United’s Dan Burn for Tuchel’s first game against Albania at Wembley, but here he again demonstrated leadership and high quality on the few occasions Villa exerted real pressure. This video can not be played How Palace dominated Villa in semi-final Eze’s impact earned him the man-of-the-match award, but he will surely have faced strong competition from the brilliant Wharton, who strode through midfield in style, a potent mixture of composure, creation and that priceless ability to win possession then use it well. Former England captain Wayne Rooney is a firm admirer, telling BBC Sport: “Attacking players get a lot of the credit, but Adam Wharton was outstanding. His commitment and winning the ball back - I thought he was the best player on the pitch. ” This follows rich praise delivered by Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola, who described him as “an excellent holding midfielder”. Wharton’s somewhat strolling style, socks at half mast, belies a fierce competitive instinct. He was not included in Tuchel’s first full England squad as Palace nursed him back after groin surgery, but the German knows what a talent he has at his disposal. He was included in England’s under-21s squad, but trained alongside the senior players at St George’s Park. Wharton, it was, who robbed Villa’s Youri Tielemans to start the move that ended with Sarr scoring Palace’s crucial second. It was one of five successful tackles he made, the most of any player in the semi-final. And so Palace go on to their third FA Cup final at Wembley, led by the charismatic Glasner and his eminently watchable team. Can he now succeed where Coppell and Alan Pardew failed and write his name into the Crystal Palace history books?

Crystal Palace captain Guehi, arguably England’s best player at Euro 2024, was surprisingly excluded in favour of Newcastle United’s Dan Burn for Tuchel’s first game against Albania at Wembley, but here he again demonstrated leadership and high quality on the few occasions Villa exerted real pressure. This video can not be played How Palace dominated Villa in semi-final Eze’s impact earned him the man-of-the-match award, but he will surely have faced strong competition from the brilliant Wharton, who strode through midfield in style, a potent mixture of composure, creation and that priceless ability to win possession then use it well. Former England captain Wayne Rooney is a firm admirer, telling BBC Sport: “Attacking players get a lot of the credit, but Adam Wharton was outstanding. His commitment and winning the ball back - I thought he was the best player on the pitch. ” This follows rich praise delivered by Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola, who described him as “an excellent holding midfielder”. Wharton’s somewhat strolling style, socks at half mast, belies a fierce competitive instinct. He was not included in Tuchel’s first full England squad as Palace nursed him back after groin surgery, but the German knows what a talent he has at his disposal. He was included in England’s under-21s squad, but trained alongside the senior players at St George’s Park. Wharton, it was, who robbed Villa’s Youri Tielemans to start the move that ended with Sarr scoring Palace’s crucial second. It was one of five successful tackles he made, the most of any player in the semi-final. And so Palace go on to their third FA Cup final at Wembley, led by the charismatic Glasner and his eminently watchable team. Can he now succeed where Coppell and Alan Pardew failed and write his name into the Crystal Palace history books?

The former University of Colorado player - the son of legendary dual-purpose player Deion Sanders - had been projected to be a top-five pick.

The Browns traded the 166th and 192nd overall picks to the Philadelphia Eagles to pick up Sanders. “We felt like he was a good, solid prospect at the most important position,” Browns general manager Andrew Berry said. “We felt it got to a point where he was probably mis-priced relative to the draft. ” He became the sixth quarterback picked in the draft - and the second by the Browns, after they also took on Oregon’s Dillon Gabriel in the third round.

    "body": "2025/04/26 - According to new developments, Leigh Leopards’ Owen Trout is tackled by Salford Red Devils Betfred Super League Salford (0) 6 Tries: Shorrocks Goals: Morgan Leigh (18) 28 Tries: Badrock (2), Towse, McIntosh, Davis, Charnley Goals: O’Brien (2) Leigh Leopards moved into second place in the Super League table and within three points of leaders Hull KR with a convincing 28-6 win at Salford Red Devils. A sixth victory of the season meant Adrian Lam’s in-form outfit leapfrogged Wigan Warriors. Although Wigan can go back second when they play Hull FC on Sunday, this was a statement victory indicating the Leopards could be contenders for league honours this season. Two tries from Andrew Badrock, plus one each from AJ Towse, Darnell McIntosh, Matt Davis and Josh Charnley in a dominant display proved enough to deliver a comfortable victory. Charnley’s late contribution, a brilliant execution in the corner a minute from time, moved him level with the legendary Leeds Rhino Alan Smith on 311 career tries. Lam’s outfit are already into the semi-finals of the Challenge Cup where they will face Warrington Wolves and, although at times a lack of discipline and some wayward goal kicking will be a concern to their coach, they are more than capable going forward. Lachlan Lam was at the heart of most of their incisive moves with two try assists, one pass and the other a perfectly-weighted grubber kick that McIntosh touched down. His try added to two early efforts from Badrock and Towse that saw Leigh put the game halfway to bed after 20 minutes. Salford, who have now lost eight of their nine matches including four of them to nil, conceded a fourth try to go in at the break 18-0 down. Things did not immediately improve after the break either with Jayden Nikorima gifting possession to Leigh and Davis punishing the mistake for a fifth Leopards try. Yet to their credit the home side tried to stay on the front foot and were rewarded with a try of their own, Nikorima breaking the gain line inside his own half and feeding Joe Shorrocks who went over close to the posts. Charnley’s late intervention stretched the lead back out as he went level with Smith in 28th place in the list of rugby league’s all-time try scorers - and 10 behind outright leader Ryan Hall with 248 Super League tries. Leigh Leopards coach Adrian Lam speaking to BBC Sport: “Magic Weekend will be round 10, we are over a third of the way through the season and in second spot which is nice considering the injuries we have and that we still have a lot of growth in the group. “I’m really happy about that and I’m sure our fans are as well. “We were one out of nine at this stage last year so we are aware that things can change if you don’t keep our feet grounded though. We have worked hard to be here so we will keep maintaining that. ” Salford: Hodgson, McIntosh, Badrock, Brand, Charnley, O’Brien, Lam, Trout, McNamara, Mulhern, O’Neill, Hughes, Liu Interchanges: Brogan, Wilde, Davis, Dwyer Leigh: Brierley, Connell, Marsters, Vaughan, Thewlis, Nikorima, Mellor, Ormondroyd, Davis, Makin, Hellewell, Shorrocks, Wilson Interchanges: Hill, Sangare, Morgan, Warren Referee: Liam Rush "

Fifth seed Draper defeated world number 34 Tallon Griekspoor of the Netherlands 6-3 6-4 after Fearnley and Norrie had beaten seeded opponents. Fearnley, ranked 68 in the world, beat a top-20 player for the first time, recovering from losing the first set against Tomas Machac of the Czech Republic, the 19th seed, to come through 1-6 6-3 6-2. His next opponent will be former Grand Slam semi-finalist and world number three Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria, the 15th seed. Norrie, now the world number 91, continued his good form in Madrid with a 2-6 6-4 6-0 success over another Czech player Jiri Lehecka, the 26th seed, to set up a meeting with Canadian lucky loser Gabriel Diallo. “Cam obviously had an injury last year so to see him coming back is great,” Draper told Sky Sports. “And Jacob, someone my age, incredible player. The British public don’t really know much about him yet but he’s going to be, I think, one of the best players in the world. “Cam’s been up there too and he can do that as well, so I think it’s really exciting for British tennis and good healthy competition for us. ” Draper bounced back from his disappointing defeat by Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in Monte Carlo to set up a meeting with former Wimbledon finalist Matteo Berrettini of Italy in round three. The 23-year-old broke to lead 4-2 on his way to taking the first set in just over half an hour, and an early break put him in control of the second on his way to victory in an hour and 15 minutes. “I’m still relatively new to the clay so I knew it was going to be a tough challenge,” he added. “Everything was ticking over really nicely so I hope I can carry on gaining more and more confidence and getting more and more effective on this surface. ” Fearnley said he felt he had been playing some of his “worst tennis” in the first set - then twisted his ankle. “It actually helped, believe it or not. The doctor gave me some painkillers and I was serving that last set some of the best I’ve served in a long time,” he said. “As of now I think my body is in a good position. ” It was his fourth match of the tournament after coming through qualifying, and he added: “The more I play these big matches, these big tournaments and get used to these surroundings, the better I handle them and the better I play. ” Live scores, results and order of play Get tennis news sent straight to your phone "

    "title": "New: Wrexham's remarkable rise - and what comes next",
    "body": "2025/04/26 - Let’s dive into the details: Wrexham will play in the second tier of English football for only the second time in their history The party at the Stok Cae Ras was in full swing on Saturday night as Wrexham sealed an unprecedented third successive promotion. Wycombe Wanderers’ 1-0 loss to Leyton Orient earlier in the day paved the way for Phil Parkinson’s side to open up an unassailable advantage over the chasing pack in League One if they could beat Charlton Athletic. It was an opportunity they grasped as Ollie Rathbone scored his eighth goal of the campaign before Sam Smith netted a brace to clinch an emphatic 3-0 win. BBC Sport Wales looks at how Wrexham made the journey to the Championship from non-league in just three seasons - and explores what the future may hold. Ollie Rathbone scored Wrexham’s opener in their 3-0 victory against Charlton Athletic Working as a writer on comedy television series Mythic Quest, current Wrexham director Humphrey Ker became a close personal friend of the show’s co-creator Rob McElhenney. The Philadelphia-born actor took an interest in football and, during the coronavirus pandemic, tasked Ker with assessing potential investment options. Hartlepool, Aldershot, Carlisle and Shamrock Rovers fans, look away now. They were among the clubs that were explored before Wrexham were chosen. And a chance encounter on Instagram proved to be the start of a dream partnership. Deadpool star Ryan Reynolds contacted McElhenney on the social media platform to praise him for his acting skills in a particular episode of It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia. The duo struck up a relationship and the rest, as they say, is history. Speaking on BBC Breakfast prior to the win over Charlton, Ker said: “They (Reynolds and McElhenney) came to understand this thing about the way our football system works that is completely alien in America, which is the idea that you can go from the top to the bottom and from the bottom to the top. In America, it’s kind of a closed circuit. ” The Hollywood pair completed their takeover of Wrexham in February 2021, making an immediate Â£2m investment after taking control from the club’s supporters’ trust. Wrexham won the 2022-23 National League title to return to the Football League for the first time since 2008 Wrexham have not finished below second place in the various divisions they have competed in any of their four seasons under Phil Parkinson, who was appointed as manager just five months after the takeover was finalised. Semi-final play-off heartache against Grimsby Town brought an abrupt end to an impressive debut campaign in north Wales for Parkinson in 2021-22. But the following season proved memorable as Wrexham clinched the National League title with a record 111 points to end a 15-year absence from the Football League. And there has been no stopping the Red Dragons since. Wrexham won 26 of their 46 matches en route to taking the runner-up spot in League Two as the club sealed back-to-back promotions last term. Despite another step up in level, Wrexham have successfully gone toe to toe with a number of former Premier League sides to take the second and final automatic promotion place in League One this season. Charlton was Parkinson’s 181st league match in charge of Wrexham, and his record is nothing short of remarkable. Wrexham have triumphed in 112 of Parkinson’s league games. Their win rate is just shy of 62%. There have been 40 draws and only 29 league defeats. Across this period, Wrexham have scored 361 league goals (not including play-offs) at a rate of almost exactly two per game while claiming an average of 2. 08 points per game. Parkinson, 57, also guided Wrexham to the FA Trophy final - they lost to Bromley at Wembley - in his first season and has twice led his side to the fourth round of the FA Cup. “Phil Parkinson, our manager, deserves anÂ unbelievableÂ amount of credit because there have been other teams that have had more resources than us in the past that have not been able to get to the cusp that we have got to,” said Ker. Rob McElhenney (left) and Ryan Reynolds are co-chairmen of Wrexham The ‘Welcome to Wrexham’ television documentary has been at the heart of the club’s rise to global prominence over recent seasons. Season four is set to premiere in May and will detail the club’s journey from League One to the Championship, with Wrexham becoming the first side in the top five divisions of English football to secure three successive promotions. While Wrexham do not earn money directly from the show, its popularity has had a significant impact on improving the club’s revenue streams. “It’s extraordinary. We often talk about the power of storytelling,” said Ker. “What we’ve been able to do with the documentary and the football clubÂ is tell people in America why football is so significant to us, what it means and whatÂ the stakes are. “Truly, I’m astonished by the volume of interest. It’s because America is fascinated by English football and we are a way in for a lot of people who don’t follow it in other ways. ” Telling the story of the local community in addition to the fortunes of the club itself, the documentary has won eight Primetime Emmy Awards and two Critics’ Choice Television Awards. “We’re tellingÂ thatÂ story, and we’re telling the story of the town,” added Ker. “The amazing thing about all football clubs is that so much life happens around them, and covering that is what we do. ” From non-league to brink of Premier League: Wrexham’s Hollywood timeline Wrexham clinch promotion with bumper Charlton win Reynolds takes selfies with fans before crunch game “Our goal is to grow the team, establish Wrexham AFC as a Premier League club, in front of increased attendances at an improved stadium while making a positive difference to the wider community in Wrexham. ” The club’s mission statement spells out the scale of the ambition of co-chairmen McElhenney and Reynolds. And Wrexham’s hierarchy have plenty to ponder as they plan for the club’s first season in the second tier since 1981-82. Their squad size will rise from 22 players to 25, while matchday squads will feature nine substitutes as opposed to seven. It could, in theory, pave the way for Paul Mullin’s return to the squad following his absence over the previous 13 games. Whatever striker Mullin’s situation, it is clear there is further work to be done on the squad, as Parkinson will want to bring in more players of a higher calibre to bolster his side’s Championship prospects. The inevitable acquisitions will lead to an increased wage bill, with Ker recently suggesting Wrexham would need to quadruple their wage outgoings to be competitive in the Championship. Work is also due to commence on improving the iconic Kop Stand at their Stok Cae Ras home, while there are plans to develop a training ground and for expansion of facilities for the academy and women’s side. It all requires money - and lots of it. But on the plus side, the club are currently operating with a model most EFL clubs will envy. The Â£26. 7m Wrexham made in revenue during their 2023-24 League Two season puts them just below the top Championship sides - who benefit from parachute payments - in terms of income. TV and sponsorship revenue will only increase in the Championship, so there is no doubt Wrexham are well placed at present. The next challenge is always the toughest, and the Championship is a different beast from what Wrexham have face over the past few years. But with such impressive alignment from top to bottom at the club, Wrexham know they are in a strong position to achieve their ultimate goal at some stage - whether it be next season or beyond. "

And a chance encounter on Instagram proved to be the start of a dream partnership. Deadpool star Ryan Reynolds contacted McElhenney on the social media platform to praise him for his acting skills in a particular episode of It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia. The duo struck up a relationship and the rest, as they say, is history. Speaking on BBC Breakfast prior to the win over Charlton, Ker said: “They (Reynolds and McElhenney) came to understand this thing about the way our football system works that is completely alien in America, which is the idea that you can go from the top to the bottom and from the bottom to the top. In America, it’s kind of a closed circuit. ” The Hollywood pair completed their takeover of Wrexham in February 2021, making an immediate Â£2m investment after taking control from the club’s supporters’ trust. Wrexham won the 2022-23 National League title to return to the Football League for the first time since 2008 Wrexham have not finished below second place in the various divisions they have competed in any of their four seasons under Phil Parkinson, who was appointed as manager just five months after the takeover was finalised. Semi-final play-off heartache against Grimsby Town brought an abrupt end to an impressive debut campaign in north Wales for Parkinson in 2021-22. But the following season proved memorable as Wrexham clinched the National League title with a record 111 points to end a 15-year absence from the Football League. And there has been no stopping the Red Dragons since. Wrexham won 26 of their 46 matches en route to taking the runner-up spot in League Two as the club sealed back-to-back promotions last term. Despite another step up in level, Wrexham have successfully gone toe to toe with a number of former Premier League sides to take the second and final automatic promotion place in League One this season. Charlton was Parkinson’s 181st league match in charge of Wrexham, and his record is nothing short of remarkable. Wrexham have triumphed in 112 of Parkinson’s league games. Their win rate is just shy of 62%. There have been 40 draws and only 29 league defeats. Across this period, Wrexham have scored 361 league goals (not including play-offs) at a rate of almost exactly two per game while claiming an average of 2. 08 points per game. Parkinson, 57, also guided Wrexham to the FA Trophy final - they lost to Bromley at Wembley - in his first season and has twice led his side to the fourth round of the FA Cup. “Phil Parkinson, our manager, deserves anÂ unbelievableÂ amount of credit because there have been other teams that have had more resources than us in the past that have not been able to get to the cusp that we have got to,” said Ker. Rob McElhenney (left) and Ryan Reynolds are co-chairmen of Wrexham The ‘Welcome to Wrexham’ television documentary has been at the heart of the club’s rise to global prominence over recent seasons. Season four is set to premiere in May and will detail the club’s journey from League One to the Championship, with Wrexham becoming the first side in the top five divisions of English football to secure three successive promotions. While Wrexham do not earn money directly from the show, its popularity has had a significant impact on improving the club’s revenue streams. “It’s extraordinary. We often talk about the power of storytelling,” said Ker. “What we’ve been able to do with the documentary and the football clubÂ is tell people in America why football is so significant to us, what it means and whatÂ the stakes are. “Truly, I’m astonished by the volume of interest. It’s because America is fascinated by English football and we are a way in for a lot of people who don’t follow it in other ways. ” Telling the story of the local community in addition to the fortunes of the club itself, the documentary has won eight Primetime Emmy Awards and two Critics’ Choice Television Awards. “We’re tellingÂ thatÂ story, and we’re telling the story of the town,” added Ker. “The amazing thing about all football clubs is that so much life happens around them, and covering that is what we do. ” From non-league to brink of Premier League: Wrexham’s Hollywood timeline Wrexham clinch promotion with bumper Charlton win Reynolds takes selfies with fans before crunch game “Our goal is to grow the team, establish Wrexham AFC as a Premier League club, in front of increased attendances at an improved stadium while making a positive difference to the wider community in Wrexham. ” The club’s mission statement spells out the scale of the ambition of co-chairmen McElhenney and Reynolds. And Wrexham’s hierarchy have plenty to ponder as they plan for the club’s first season in the second tier since 1981-82. Their squad size will rise from 22 players to 25, while matchday squads will feature nine substitutes as opposed to seven. It could, in theory, pave the way for Paul Mullin’s return to the squad following his absence over the previous 13 games. Whatever striker Mullin’s situation, it is clear there is further work to be done on the squad, as Parkinson will want to bring in more players of a higher calibre to bolster his side’s Championship prospects. The inevitable acquisitions will lead to an increased wage bill, with Ker recently suggesting Wrexham would need to quadruple their wage outgoings to be competitive in the Championship. Work is also due to commence on improving the iconic Kop Stand at their Stok Cae Ras home, while there are plans to develop a training ground and for expansion of facilities for the academy and women’s side. It all requires money - and lots of it. But on the plus side, the club are currently operating with a model most EFL clubs will envy. The Â£26. 7m Wrexham made in revenue during their 2023-24 League Two season puts them just below the top Championship sides - who benefit from parachute payments - in terms of income. TV and sponsorship revenue will only increase in the Championship, so there is no doubt Wrexham are well placed at present. The next challenge is always the toughest, and the Championship is a different beast from what Wrexham have face over the past few years. But with such impressive alignment from top to bottom at the club, Wrexham know they are in a strong position to achieve their ultimate goal at some stage - whether it be next season or beyond. "

    "title": "Big News: Huge blast at key Iranian port kills eight and injures more than 750",
    "body": "2025/04/26 - Let’s dive into the details: At least eight people have been killed and 750 injured in a massive explosion at one of Iran’s key ports, authorities say. The blast took place at Shahid Rajaee, the country’s largest commercial port, near the southern city of Bandar Abbas on Saturday morning. It blew out windows and roofs of nearby buildings and destroyed cars. Residents reported feeling the impact of the blast up to 50km (31 miles) away. Videos verified by the BBC show a fire growing in intensity before a huge explosion, with people subsequently fleeing the blast and others lying wounded on roads surrounded by smoking debris. “The entire warehouse was filled with smoke, dust and ashes. I don’t remember if I went under the table or was thrown there by the blast,” one person who was in the area told state TV. Aerial footage showed at least three areas ablaze and Iran’s interior minister later confirmed that the fire was spreading from one container to another. Schools and offices in the region have been ordered to remain closed on Sunday. One private maritime risk firm said it believed the affected containers had contained solid fuel destined for ballistic missiles. The fire was the result of “improper handling of a shipment of solid fuel intended for use in Iranian ballistic missiles”, Ambrey Intelligence said. Ambrey said it was aware that an Iran-flagged ship “discharged a shipment of sodium perchlorate rocket fuel at the port in March 2025”. The Financial Times newspaper had previously reported that two vessels had shipped fuel to Iran from China. State media quoted witnesses as saying the explosion occurred after a fire broke out and spread to unsealed containers storing “flammable materials”. Customs officials later released a statement reported by Iranian state TV saying the explosion had probably resulted from a fire that had broken out in a hazmat and chemical materials storage depot. In a later update Ambrey quoted Iran’s National Disaster Management Organisation as saying officials had previously issued warnings to Shahid Rajaee port regarding the safe storage of chemicals. Shahid Rajaee port is Iran’s largest and most advanced terminal, through which much of the country’s commercial shipping transits. It is located on the Strait of Hormuz, a major shipping channel for oil cargo, and is about 20km (12 miles) west of Bandar Abbas, Iran’s major port city on its south coast and home to the Iranian Navy’s main base. Iran’s national oil production company said the explosion at the port had “no connection” to the country’s oil refineries, fuel tanks and pipelines, local media reported. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has expressed his “deep regret and sympathy” for victims. He has announced a government investigation and sent the interior minister to the region to lead it. Saturday’s explosion coincided with the latest round of negotiations between Iranian and US officials on Iran’s nuclear programme, with US President Donald Trump aiming to make a deal that would prevent Tehran from gaining nuclear weapons. Negotiating through Oman mediators, both sides reported that progress had been made, but Iran’s top representative said work was still needed to narrow differences. Negotiations will continue next week. Iran has said it is open to curbs on its nuclear programme in return for sanctions easing but has insisted it will not stop enriching uranium. It insists its nuclear programme is for civilian use. The talks this year have marked the first high-level engagement between the US and Iran since 2018, when Trump in his first term pulled out of a previous deal to restrict Iran’s nuclear activities and reinstated economic sanctions.

    "body": "2025/04/26 - It has been recently reported that Three people have been injured in an “ongoing serious incident” involving a man seen with weapons in Leeds. The man was seen in Otley Road, in the Headingley area, at 14:47 BST, West Yorkshire Police said. A male has been detained and inquires are ongoing to establish exactly what has happened. The force said officers “attended and located three people who had suffered injuries which are at this time not being treated as life threatening”, adding that “further updates will follow”. A spokesperson added: “A number of police scenes remain in place, ensuring public safety remains our priority. ” The incident happened on the Otley Run, which is a popular pub crawl route in Leeds. Those participating in the run could be seen in fancy dress outside venues on Otley Road, close to where the incident happened. Taylor’s Sports Bar &amp; Grill, a venue which is part of the pub crawl, announced on social media it would be closed until further notice. A statement on its Facebook page said the closure was “due to unforeseen circumstances”, before apologising to customers. Joanna Myers, owner of the Swine Bistro on Otley Road, said: “It was all very shocking, especially with all the Otley runners out. “It could have been a lot worse than it was. ” Ali Khan, owner of Indian restaurant The Cat’s Pyjamas which is on Otley Road, said people were “afraid and concerned” following the incident. “We didn’t find it safe to go out anywhere unless we knew what was going on,” he said. “I told all my staff members to stay inside and stay safe and vigilant. ” Chancellor of the Exchequer and MP for Leeds West and Pudsey Rachel Reeves said it was “shocking” and asked anyone with information to contact the police. She said: “My thoughts are with all of those affected. ” Mayor of West Yorkshire Tracy Brabin added: “I am being fully briefed by West Yorkshire Police as they work with local communities on the ground. “As a suspect is in custody, I would ask people to refrain from sharing any speculation across social media. ” Listen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North.

    "title": "Update: Seven-try Saints dent Bristol hopes of home play-off",
    "body": "2025/04/26 - It has been recently reported that Northampton’s Tommy Freeman goes over to score in a chaotic first half which featured six tries Gallagher Premiership Northampton 48 (27) Tries: Mitchell, Langdon, Freeman 2, Iyogun, Augustus, Pollock Cons: Smith 4, Hutchinson Pens: Smith Bristol 31 (12) Tries: Bailey, Ibitoye 2, Williams, Marmion Cons: MacGinty 2, Williams Northampton Saints put a further dent in Bristol Bears’ home Premiership semi-final hopes with an enthralling 48-31 victory at Franklin’s Gardens. In a frenetic first half, Deago Bailey scored first for the visitors before Alex Mitchell, Curtis Langdon and two efforts from Tommy Freeman gave the home team a commanding lead. Gabriel Ibitoye’s spectacular effort on the verge of half-time brought Bristol back into the game, but further tries from Emmanuel Iyogun, Juarno Augustus and Henry Pollock put the game beyond the visitors despite late consolation efforts from James Williams, Ibitoye and Kieran Marmion. The result leaves Bristol fourth on 47 points, four points behind second-placed Leicester Tigers, while the Saints move up to seventh. Following their poor recent run of form, Bristol knew a win was vital in their efforts to secure a home semi-final in the play-offs and they started strongly. Camped in the Saints’ twenty-two, Rich Lane played the final pass to release Bailey on the outside, who burned past Rory Hutchinson to score in the corner. But that lead did not last long. Saints struck back through Alex Mitchell; the England scrum-half dummying magnificently to break the Bristol line, before sidestepping Bailey in front of the appreciative home crowd. The Saints then doubled their lead with a try scored in unusual circumstances. With the ball kicked through into the Bristol half, first Finn Smith then Pollock were stripped of it by separate Saints’ defenders, before the ball rebounded off the posts for Langdon to dive on it and score. The Saints’ third score of the day was rather more prosaic. Following a lengthy period of pressure in the Bristol twenty-two, the home team eventually found a gap on the outside, with James Ramm feeding Freeman to dive over in the corner. Phil Dowson’s men were playing champagne rugby and came very close to a fourth when Ramm went over again following an intricate attacking move, only for the referee to rule that a pass earlier in the move had gone forward. The Australian was in the thick of it again at the other end of the field just minutes later, delivering a textbook tap tackle to prevent Kalaveti Ravouvou from scoring an almost certain try as Bristol split the home defence. With the match being played at a frantic pace, the Saints secured the try bonus point soon after as Freeman forced his way over from short range after being fed by Mitchell. But Bristol, stung by the Saints onslaught, had a trick to play of their own just before half-time. Ibitoye’s attempted kick ahead was charged down before falling into the hands of Harry Randall, who burst upfield before returning the ball to the flying winger. Smith tried to tackle him, but Ibitoye slipped from the fly-half’s grasp and waltzed over the line as Saints’ defenders collided around him. Henry Pollock (centre) makes a break for Northampton in a match that was not short on attacking intent Down by 15 points at half-time, Bristol tried to attack from their own twenty-two after the restart, but with Lane driven back by Freeman, the ball was spilled, allowing Iyogun to gather and force himself over the line for the Saints’ fifth score. Following repeated Saints attacks the home side were in again. With Bristol unable to get out of their own half, Augustus powered his way over from close range, despite the attentions of Ravouvou. The intensity barely dropped as the final 10 minutes beckoned, with Saints inches away from a seventh score as Tom Seabrook knocked on following a length-of-the-field counter-attack initiated by Alex Coles. But with the game gone, Bristol continued pressing. Siva Naulago found himself in space down the wing, driving into the Saints half. The ball was then recycled by Steven Luatua, who in his 150th appearance for the Bears fed Williams for Bristol’s third. Replacement Tom James then fed Pollock for the Saints’ final try, before Ibitoye and Marmion restored some respectability to the scoreline with a late flourish. Northampton Saints director of rugby Phil Dowson told BBC Radio Northampton: “The middle 50 minutes I thought we were excellent. We started a little bit shakily and we finished in the same vein with lots of changes, but for the main part I thought we executed what we were trying to do in both attack and defence. “Every game is an opportunity to work on our performance, how we can get better, and I thought our breakdown skills and our application in the contact area was outstanding. ” [On James Ramm’s try-saving tap tackle] “It was like a 21-point swing, if that had gone in it would have kept them in the game.

It’s the story of our last few games, we concede a lot of tries but some of the tries we just pop and give way too easy. “The boys are putting their hands up and as Stevie [Luatua] said, we’ve got to get our skill level right if we want to play our game. “I watched the body language after they scored, we were still pushing for the bonus point at the end, which was crucial. It keeps us in the top four with three to go - it’s in our control, albeit we’ve got the big game against Bath. ” Northampton: Ramm; Freeman, Dingwall, Hutchinson, Litchfield; Smith, Mitchell; Iyogun, Langdon, Millar Mills, Mayanavanua, Coles, Kemeny, Pollock, Augustus.

    "title": "Latest: Seven-try Saints dent Bristol hopes of home play-off",
    "body": "2025/04/26 - Let’s dive into the details: Northampton’s Tommy Freeman goes over to score in a chaotic first half which featured six tries Gallagher Premiership Northampton 48 (27) Tries: Mitchell, Langdon, Freeman 2, Iyogun, Augustus, Pollock Cons: Smith 4, Hutchinson Pens: Smith Bristol 31 (12) Tries: Bailey, Ibitoye 2, Williams, Marmion Cons: MacGinty 2, Williams Northampton Saints put a further dent in Bristol Bears’ home Premiership semi-final hopes with an enthralling 48-31 victory at Franklin’s Gardens. In a frenetic first half, Deago Bailey scored first for the visitors before Alex Mitchell, Curtis Langdon and two efforts from Tommy Freeman gave the home team a commanding lead. Gabriel Ibitoye’s spectacular effort on the verge of half-time brought Bristol back into the game, but further tries from Emmanuel Iyogun, Juarno Augustus and Henry Pollock put the game beyond the visitors despite late consolation efforts from James Williams, Ibitoye and Kieran Marmion. The result leaves Bristol fourth on 47 points, four points behind second-placed Leicester Tigers, while the Saints move up to seventh. Following their poor recent run of form, Bristol knew a win was vital in their efforts to secure a home semi-final in the play-offs and they started strongly. Camped in the Saints’ twenty-two, Rich Lane played the final pass to release Bailey on the outside, who burned past Rory Hutchinson to score in the corner. But that lead did not last long. Saints struck back through Alex Mitchell; the England scrum-half dummying magnificently to break the Bristol line, before sidestepping Bailey in front of the appreciative home crowd. The Saints then doubled their lead with a try scored in unusual circumstances. With the ball kicked through into the Bristol half, first Finn Smith then Pollock were stripped of it by separate Saints’ defenders, before the ball rebounded off the posts for Langdon to dive on it and score. The Saints’ third score of the day was rather more prosaic. Following a lengthy period of pressure in the Bristol twenty-two, the home team eventually found a gap on the outside, with James Ramm feeding Freeman to dive over in the corner. Phil Dowson’s men were playing champagne rugby and came very close to a fourth when Ramm went over again following an intricate attacking move, only for the referee to rule that a pass earlier in the move had gone forward. The Australian was in the thick of it again at the other end of the field just minutes later, delivering a textbook tap tackle to prevent Kalaveti Ravouvou from scoring an almost certain try as Bristol split the home defence. With the match being played at a frantic pace, the Saints secured the try bonus point soon after as Freeman forced his way over from short range after being fed by Mitchell. But Bristol, stung by the Saints onslaught, had a trick to play of their own just before half-time. Ibitoye’s attempted kick ahead was charged down before falling into the hands of Harry Randall, who burst upfield before returning the ball to the flying winger. Smith tried to tackle him, but Ibitoye slipped from the fly-half’s grasp and waltzed over the line as Saints’ defenders collided around him. Henry Pollock (centre) makes a break for Northampton in a match that was not short on attacking intent Down by 15 points at half-time, Bristol tried to attack from their own twenty-two after the restart, but with Lane driven back by Freeman, the ball was spilled, allowing Iyogun to gather and force himself over the line for the Saints’ fifth score. Following repeated Saints attacks the home side were in again. With Bristol unable to get out of their own half, Augustus powered his way over from close range, despite the attentions of Ravouvou. The intensity barely dropped as the final 10 minutes beckoned, with Saints inches away from a seventh score as Tom Seabrook knocked on following a length-of-the-field counter-attack initiated by Alex Coles. But with the game gone, Bristol continued pressing. Siva Naulago found himself in space down the wing, driving into the Saints half. The ball was then recycled by Steven Luatua, who in his 150th appearance for the Bears fed Williams for Bristol’s third. Replacement Tom James then fed Pollock for the Saints’ final try, before Ibitoye and Marmion restored some respectability to the scoreline with a late flourish. Northampton Saints director of rugby Phil Dowson told BBC Radio Northampton: “The middle 50 minutes I thought we were excellent. We started a little bit shakily and we finished in the same vein with lots of changes, but for the main part I thought we executed what we were trying to do in both attack and defence. “Every game is an opportunity to work on our performance, how we can get better, and I thought our breakdown skills and our application in the contact area was outstanding. ” [On James Ramm’s try-saving tap tackle] “It was like a 21-point swing, if that had gone in it would have kept them in the game. When you talk about chasing lost causes and working your tail off, that was it. ” Bristol Bears director of rugby Pat Lam told BBC Radio Bristol: “We started off really well and then we gave away some soft tries. It’s the story of our last few games, we concede a lot of tries but some of the tries we just pop and give way too easy. “The boys are putting their hands up and as Stevie [Luatua] said, we’ve got to get our skill level right if we want to play our game. “I watched the body language after they scored, we were still pushing for the bonus point at the end, which was crucial.

    "body": "2025/04/26 - Experts revealed that This video can not be played Ipswich already looking to the future after relegation Ipswich Town’s rapid rise to the top is now starting a descent the club itself has been braced for. Successive promotions from League One to the Premier League ended their 22-year exile from the top flight last summer, but they have been unable to stave off an immediate return to the Championship. The Tractor Boys’ fate was sealed on Saturday afternoon by Champions League-chasing Newcastle, who capitalised on Ben Johnson’s first-half red card to secure a comfortable 3-0 victory. Ipswich’s relegation is not a huge surprise, even within Portman Road. They are in better shape than fellow relegated sides Southampton and Leicester - financially and in terms of strategy and togetherness. But that did not make the sound of Michael Salisbury’s final whistle at St James’ Park any less painful for boss Kieran McKenna and his players, who looked crestfallen as they applauded their fans at full time. “We’re disappointed and gutted the dream is over,” said defender Luke Woolfenden. “We’ve not been at it this season. I think we have probably let ourselves down one too many times. ” McKenna, meanwhile, admitted he had come to terms with the prospect of relegation following the 2-1 defeat by Wolves at Portman Road earlier this month. “We knew we had given ourselves too much to do,” he told Sky Sports. “We knew the games had run out. ” Newcastle send Ipswich down as Magpies go third With the Saints and the Foxes joining Ipswich in the Championship next season, all three promoted sides have suffered instant demotion. It is the first time in Premier League history that the identity of all three relegated sides has been known with as many as four games to go, and the second time after 2005-06 that all three have been confirmed before May. It is not difficult to understand why McKenna cut a resigned figure after the Wolves defeat, which left the Tractor Boys 12 points adrift of safety with seven matches remaining. His team have lost a league-high 27 points from winning positions this season - including the loss against Wolves, who recovered from 1-0 down to triumph 2-1. They have also struggled to turn Portman Road into a fortress, collecting just seven of their 21 points so far in front of their own supporters. Only rock-bottom Southampton have picked up fewer points on home soil this season. “There are so many lessons,” McKenna said. “Ours might be different from other clubs’ because we’ve climbed so quickly from League One. It’s been a massive challenge. “There are many things we have done positively that will set us up well for the years ahead, and there are some things we could have done better and things we will learn from. ” Injuries have not been kind to Ipswich either this season. They were without 10 first-team players at Newcastle on Saturday, with Leif Davis’ suspension leaving them without a recognised left-back. Discipline - or a lack of it - has also been an issue. Johnson’s dismissal was Ipswich’s fifth red card of the season - only Arsenal have had as many red cards in the top flight in 2024-25. “[Red cards] have been costly,” McKenna told BBC Match of the Day. “I think we had one in my two-and-half years before this season. “To have five this season is a reflection of a lot of things. ” Liam Delap is Ipswich’s top scorer this season with 12 Premier League goals For a club who were in League One two years ago, the step up to the top flight was always going to be huge - and Ipswich needed to recruit significantly to try to bridge the gap. The Tractor Boys spent around Â£120m last summer and added Â£20m Jaden Philogene in January. They targeted young English assets in a business decision â Liam Delap, Jack Clarke and Jacob Greaves â that the club expect to make money on this summer or beyond. The investment did not work in terms of keeping them in the division, but Ipswich believe the value in their squad is there. Striker Delap is the obvious example, with the striker poised to net the club a minimum of Â£30m because of the relegation release clause in his contract. The 22-year-old’s 12 Premier League goals have seen him become the club’s standout performer and the expectation is he will move in the summer. He has not been pushing to leave and Delap is understood to be conscious of making the right move, rather than jumping at the biggest offer from the biggest club. They may also lose Davis or forward Omari Hutchinson but the cash is there to invest, those sales would help with any Profit and Sustainability concerns, and Ipswich are wary of balancing the books without harming the squad’s quality. McKenna’s future will also be up for speculation. He was close to joining Crystal Palace last February - before they appointed Oliver Glasner - while flirtations with Brighton, Chelsea and Manchester United ultimately came to nothing before he signed a new deal last April. He will remain hot property, despite relegation, but there is currently no obvious pathway away from Portman Road. McKenna is planning to lead Ipswich in the Championship, where they intend to back him again in the summer with the target an immediate return to the Premier League. He said month: “I was proud to lead the club when we were in League One. I was proud to lead the club when we were in the Championship and I’m proud to lead the club now in the Premier League. So that doesn’t change my perspective too much. “We’re already looking forward again, to be honest, irrespective of what division we’re in. We’re already looking forward to progressing the club further. ” "

So that doesn’t change my perspective too much. “We’re already looking forward again, to be honest, irrespective of what division we’re in. We’re already looking forward to progressing the club further. ” "

    "body": "2025/04/26 - According to new developments, Djokovic has slipped to number five in the world rankings Novak Djokovic says he is facing up to a “new reality” after losing his opening match for the second successive tournament. The Serb, seeking a fourth Madrid Open title, was beaten 6-3 6-4 by Italian Matteo Arnaldi. Djokovic made his Madrid debut in 2006 and won the tournament in 2011, 2016 and 2019. However, he said does not yet know if he will play again in Madrid following Saturday’s loss to a player ranked 44 in the world. When asked if it was his final match there, he said: “I’m not sure if I will come back. So, I don’t know. “I mean, I’ll come back, maybe not as a player. I hope it’s not, but it could be. ” Djokovic said his “level of tennis is not where I would like it to be”, and added: “I lost to a better player. “I’ve had a few of these this year where I lose in the first round, unfortunately. ” It was a third consecutive defeat for the 24-time Grand Slam winner, who is seeking a 100th career title. He also lost in his opening match in Monte Carlo this month, after being beaten in the Miami Masters final in March. “[It’s a] kind of new reality for me, I have to say,” he said. “You know, trying to win a match or two, not really thinking about getting far in the tournament. “It’s a completely different feeling from what I had in 20-plus years of professional tennis, so it’s kind of a challenge for me mentally to really face these kind of sensations on the court, going out early now regularly in the tournaments. “But that’s, I guess, the circle of life and the career. Eventually it was going to happen. ” It was a second career win against a top-five player for Arnaldi, 24, who was facing the Serbian fourth seed for the first time. “He’s my idol, he’s always been, so I was just glad that I could play him,” Arnaldi said. “To play him on a stage like this was already a victory for me. “But he’s not at his best right now so I came on court to try to play my best tennis and win and it happened, so right now I don’t even know what to say. ” Three-time champion Djokovic, 37, made 32 unforced errors against an opponent who brought a series of delightful shots out of the bag throughout. Also progressing to the next round with Arnaldi are British trio Cameron Norrie, Jacob Fearnley and Jack Draper. British number three Norrie, who is recovering from illness, started slowly against Czech Jiri Lehecka before winning 2-6 6-4 6-0. Fearnley, the British number two, similarly lost his first set before overcoming another Czech in top-20 seed Tomas Machac, booking his passage to the next round with a 1-6 6-3 6-2 victory. Then world number six Draper put in a dominant peformance against Dutchman Tallon Griekspoor, winning 6-3 6-4 to set up a match with Italy’s Matteo Berrettini in the next round.

    "title": "Latest: Trans people should be given alternative facilities to use, watchdog says",
    "body": "2025/04/26 - According to new developments, The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has released interim guidance on how organisations should interpret the UK Supreme Court’s ruling that a woman is defined by biological sex in law. The new guidance says that, in places like hospitals, shops and restaurants, “trans women (biological men) should not be permitted to use the women’s facilities”. It also states that trans people should not be left without any facilities to use. The EHRC said it was releasing interim guidance because “many people have questions about the judgement and what it means for them”. Guidance on when competitive sports can be single-sex will be published in due course, the EHRC said. Last week the Supreme Court found the terms “woman” and “sex” in the 2010 Equality Act “refer to a biological woman and biological sex”. This means, for instance, that transgender women, who are biologically male but identify as women, can be excluded from women-only spaces. As part of the judgement, Supreme Court judge Lord Hodge stressed that the law still gives protection against discrimination to transgender people. The EHRC - which enforces equalities law and provides guidance to policymakers, public sector bodies and businesses - said the impact of the ruling was that “if somebody identifies as trans, they do not change sex for the purposes of the [Equality] Act, even if they have a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC)”. In this respect, the EHRC says, “a trans woman is a biological man” and “a trans man is a biological woman”. The guidance also states that “in some circumstances the law also allows trans women (biological men) not to be permitted to use the men’s facilities, and trans men (biological women) not to be permitted to use the women’s facilities”. When asked to clarify this, the EHRC pointed to a section of the Supreme Court ruling stating that trans men could be excluded from women’s facilities “where reasonable objection is taken to their presence, for example because the gender reassignment process has given them a masculine appearance or attributes to which reasonable objection might be taken” in the context of a women-only service. The EHRC guidance adds: “However where facilities are available to both men and women, trans people should not be put in a position where there are no facilities for them to use. ” Akua Reindorf KC, a barrister and a Commissioner at the EHRC, told BBC Radio 4’s PM programme that situations where trans men could be excluded from women’s facilities would be decided on a “case-by-case” basis. She said there “should never be a situation where a trans person is left without a toilet to use”. But, citing the example of a rape crisis counselling session, she said a trans man could be “excluded properly and lawfully from that because of the alarm that it may cause to vulnerable women to share that space with somebody who to all intents and purposes appears to be a man”. Where possible, mixed-sex toilets, washing or changing facilities should be provided in addition to sufficient single-sex facilities, according to the guidance. Alternatively, the guidance says it is possible to have toilet, washing or changing facilities which can be used by all, provided they are “in lockable rooms (not cubicles)” and intended to be used by one person at a time. One such example might be a single toilet in a small business such as a café. In schools, it says: “Pupils who identify as trans girls (biological boys) should not be permitted to use the girls’ toilet or changing facilities, and pupils who identify as trans boys (biological girls) should not be permitted to use the boys’ toilet or changing facilities. Suitable alternative provisions may be required. ” In associations - groups or clubs with more than 25 members - the EHRC says “a women-only or lesbian-only association should not admit trans women (biological men), and a men-only or gay men-only association should not admit trans men (biological women)”. The EHRC says the interim guidance, published online on Friday evening, is intended to highlight the main consequences of the Supreme Court judgement. “Employers and other duty-bearers must follow the law and should take appropriate specialist legal advice where necessary,” it adds. A two-week consultation to seek views from “affected stakeholders” is expected to be launched in May. The EHRC aims to provide an updated code of practice to the government for ministerial approval by the end of June. A government spokesperson said: “We welcome the ruling and the clarity it brings for women, and service providers. “We will review and update policy wherever necessary to ensure it complies with the latest legal requirements. ” A spokesman for the Scottish government said it was “keen to work with EHRC to ensure consistent, inclusive and comprehensive guidance is in place following the Supreme Court judgement” and would meet the body to “discuss further”.

    "body": "2025/04/26 - Let’s dive into the details: Numerous world leaders and royals have gathered in Rome for Pope Francis’ funeral. Among the most prominent figures at the Vatican’s St Peter’s Square on Saturday morning were Prince William, US President Donald Trump and his predecessor Joe Biden, Britain’s Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron. Their attendance comes at a fragile time for international diplomacy, with Trump meeting Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky before the service. So among the VIP attendees, who sat next to whom? Trump was in a front-row seat near Francis’ coffin, alongside his wife Melania Trump, across the aisle from Macron and his wife Brigitte. Intriguingly, he and First Lady Melania were sitting between two staunch supporters of Ukraine. Estonia’s President Alar Karis was to Melania’s left, and Finland’s Alexander Stubb to Trump’s right. Estonia and Finland are both staunch allies of another man of the moment in attendance - Zelensky, who looked sombre-faced at the Vatican. He was sitting on the same row as Macron, separated by a few other dignitaries. Zelensky, who has been locked in negotiations and public arguments with Trump in recent weeks, was just 10 seats and one aisle away from him, on the same row. Shortly before the funeral started, the pair were pictured sitting locked in deep discussion. The White House described the 15-minute meeting as “very productive,” while Zelensky said it was “very symbolic” and had “potential to become historic”. The VIPs were in a separate section from the hundreds of thousands of members of the public who have descended on Rome for the event. Dignitaries were sitting on the the right-hand side of the square, next to St Peter’s Basilica. Those with the best seats were Javier Milei, president of Francis’ native Argentina, Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Italian President Sergio Mattarella, representing the country that surrounds the Vatican City state. Behind them were reigning sovereigns, and other delegations were seated in alphabetical order in French, the official language of diplomacy, on other benches. Representing British royalty, the Prince of Wales was sitting next to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz several rows back from the front, and some distance away from Starmer. Starmer himself sat in the fifth row with his wife Victoria. Behind the British leader was the World Health Organization’s (WHO) director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Former US President Joe Biden was seen hand in hand with his wife Jill. He was sitting four rows behind Trump. Many European leaders, as well as royalty from European countries, were in attendance. The Macrons watched the service closely from their front row position, and the French president shook hands with Trump. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was at the proceedings, and was seen chatting with Macron. Other political figures and royals attending the Pope’s funeral included: Correction 26 April 2025: This story has been updated to remove reference to Chen Chien-jen, who is the former vice-president of Taiwan, not the vice-president of China as originally stated in this story.

He’s a nice guy and clearly knows a lot about football, but he was never a Hearts manager. “That’s a bigger issue for me - who’s making these appointments. Critchley was the seventh appointment since Ann Budge took the club out of administration and the track record has not been great. “When Neil Critchley’s name was mooted, I don’t think a single person associated with Hearts thought ‘oh, that’s a good appointment’. “With this one, the board basically absolved themselves of any responsibility for it and handed the decision over to Jamestown Analytics. You cannot just take a step back and give full responsibility to someone else. “Jamestown Analytics was heralded as the tool that could have Hearts challenge for the title but they’ve not been able to get a manager who could last a season and that undermines it. “I don’t think it’s rocket science. Far too often, it feels like they are trying to be too smart and do things differently rather than just doing football things properly. “Hearts are arguably the third biggest club in the country and should be challenging every season. But they’re bottom six and not maximising what they’ve got. ” What do you make of Hearts decision to sack Critchley? And what should the club do now? Let us know here "

    "body": "2025/04/26 - Here’s what you need to know: Alexander Isak scored his 22nd goal of the season as Newcastle overcame Ipswich Town 3-0 Newcastle boosted their Champions League qualification hopes with a comfortable win against Ipswich Town on Saturday, with goals from Alexander Isak, Dan Burn and Will Osula sending Eddie Howe’s side third in the Premier League. The victory moved them above Manchester City, who had posted a late victory against fellow top-five contenders Aston Villa earlier in the week. Chelsea also earned an important 1-0 win against Everton on Saturday to climb to fifth, and are only two points behind Newcastle and tied with Nottingham Forest, who have a game in hand. After the latest set of results in the English top flight, only five points separate Villa, in seventh, and third-placed Newcastle. With the Premier League’s top five guaranteed a spot in the Champions League next term, the race for Europe remains closely contested as the season enters its final weeks. Forest have twice lifted the European Cup but have not played in Europe’s premier competition since 1980, while Villa reached the quarter-finals this season, where they lost to Paris St-Germain. As many as 11 European places are up for grabs and there will definitely be a minimum of eight Premier League teams - up from the usual seven - playing in Europe next season, but things could change in the coming weeks. It means Crystal Palace, down in 12th, remain in contention for a place in Europe through the league as well as if they win the FA Cup. BBC Sport takes a look at how many teams could qualify for each of the European competitions - the Champions League, Europa League and Conference League. Newcastle go third after beating Ipswich Jackson goal sends Chelsea back into Champions League places Sessegnon snatches Fulham win at Southampton Liverpool: Tottenham (H); Chelsea (A); Arsenal (H); Brighton (A); Crystal Palace (H) Arsenal: Bournemouth (H); Liverpool (A); Newcastle (H); Southampton (A) Newcastle: Brighton (A); Chelsea (H); Arsenal (A); Everton (H) Nottingham Forest: Brentford (H); Crystal Palace (A); Leicester (H); West Ham (A); Chelsea (H) Manchester City: Wolves (H); Southampton (A); Bournemouth (H); Fulham (A) Chelsea: Everton (H); Liverpool (H); Newcastle (A); Manchester United (H); Nottingham Forest (A) Aston Villa: Fulham (H); Bournemouth (A); Tottenham (H); Manchester United (A) Bournemouth: Manchester United (H); Arsenal (A); Aston Villa (H); Manchester City (A); Leicester (H) Fulham: Aston Villa (A); Everton (H); Brentford (A); Manchester City (H) Brighton: Newcastle (H); Wolves (A); Liverpool (H); Tottenham (A) Brentford: Nottingham Forest (A); Manchester United (H); Ipswich (A); Fulham (H); Wolves (A) Crystal Palace: Nottingham Forest (H); Tottenham (A); Wolves (H); Liverpool (A) Depending on how things pan out this season there will be between eight and 11 teams from the Premier League taking part in Europe next season. A minimum of five of those will be in the Champions League, which is higher than the usual four because of England’s performance in Uefa’s coefficient rankings. That number could rise to six should Arsenal win the Champions League and finish outside the top five - an unlikely prospect - or even seven if that happens and Manchester United or Tottenham win the Europa League. The maximum number of Premier League teams who could be competing in the Europa League is three. Two places will likely go to the team who finishes sixth and the FA Cup winners. However, if the cup winners have already secured a European place it will then go to the next highest placed side that has not qualified for Europe. A third place could be awarded if Chelsea win the Conference League and fail to qualify for the Champions League. There will be one Conference League place awarded to a Premier League team. Currently, that will go to Carabao Cup winners Newcastle, but that could change if Eddie Howe’s side qualify for the Champions League or the Europa League. As Newcastle currently sit inside the top four that looks likely. There is realistic scenario where finishing ninth or 10th in the Premier League could earn you a spot in the Conference League. This could happen, but it is highly improbable. It would require Arsenal to win the Champions League, Manchester United or Tottenham to win the Europa League and Chelsea to lift the Conference League trophy, and all three winners to finish outside the top six. Arsenal are second in the Premier League and highly unlikely to finish outside the top five. Listen to the latest Football Daily podcast Get football news sent straight to your phone "

    "body": "2025/04/26 - Experts revealed that Russian security forces say they have detained a Ukrainian spy accused of killing a senior Russian general in a car bomb attack in Moscow’s suburbs on Friday. The FSB secret service said they had apprehended “Ukrainian special services agent Ignat Kuzi” who had “planted explosives in a Volkswagen Golf” to kill Gen Yaroslav Moskalik. Gen Moskalik had been the deputy head of the main operational directorate of the military’s General Staff. He died after walking past the car parked outside his house in the suburb of Balashikha. The FSB said Kuzin had rigged the car with a homemade explosive device and the bomb had then been set off remotely from Ukraine. Ukraine has not commented on the bombing. The FSB said the suspect had been recruited by Ukraine in 2023, and had driven to Moscow in September that year. Russian media also reported that the FSB had released a video showing the detained man giving an apparent confession, as well as footage of his arrest and of the bomb’s components. The Kremlin had on Friday blamed Ukraine for the attack, saying Kyiv “continues its involvement in terrorist activities inside our country”. Gen Moskalik had represented Russia in talks with Ukraine in Paris in 2015, which resulted in the failed Minsk agreements which aimed to end the fighting in the Donbas region between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatist forces that started in 2014. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. "

    "body": "2025/04/26 - Here’s what you need to know: This video can not be played England survive France comeback to win Grand Slam by a single point Women’s Six Nations England (31) 43 Tries: Dow 2, Sing 2, Atkin-Davies, MacDonald, Aldcroft Cons: Harrison 4 France (21) 42 Tries: Arbez, Bourdon, Menager, Arbey, Bourgeois, Grisez Cons: Bourgeois 6 England held off a late France fightback to secure a fourth consecutive Women’s Six Nations Grand Slam and a seventh straight title. The victory at Allianz Stadium, Twickenham extends the Red Roses’ winning run to 25 games as they count down to the home Rugby World Cup that starts in August. In front of a crowd of 37,573, the hosts came out of the blocks quickly to score the opening try through the prolific Abby Dow. Fly-half Carla Arbez quickly responded before John Mitchell’s side ruthlessly scored four tries to take control. Full-back Emma Sing, in for the injured Ellie Kildunne, grabbed two tries, while hooker Lark Atkin-Davies and in-form wing Claudia MacDonald also crossed. However, a dropped ball by Zoe Harrison gifted scrum-half Pauline Bourdon Sansus a try and France capitalised on that momentum when centre Marine Menager scored to cut the gap to 10 points at the break. Captain Zoe Aldcroft restored England’s advantage but that was quickly cancelled out by Kelly Arbey, who produced a sensational finish down the wing. Dow and Morgane Bourgeois then traded tries before Joanna Grisez raced away to set up a nervy finish in a highly entertaining second half. England’s last defeat in the Six Nations was against France in 2018 and their record run of championship wins has now moved to 34 games. It is Mitchell’s second Grand Slam since taking over side in the autumn of 2023, with the Red Roses last tasting defeat in the World Cup final by New Zealand in 2022. “That was a bit nervy,” Mitchell told BBC Sport. “Defence wins titles and that wasn’t great from us but our start was pretty good. “France made lots of pick and goes and we were poor in edge defence. “I would rather have this sort of feedback, any day of the week. We got it done, we completed a goal that hasn’t been done in the modern era - four Grand Slams in a row - and now we can have a celebration and get ready for a World Cup. ” Aldcroft added: “I am so proud of all of the girls’ effort, we battled it out today. France came at us so all credit to us for holding on. “When we build pressure we need to keep our foot on the throttle. We will have a couple of drinks after this and enjoy tonight. ” This video can not be played ‘We got it done’ - England coach Mitchell on ‘nervy’ Grand Slam win ‘We got it done’ - relieved England clinch Grand Slam after beating France by one point Last year in Bordeaux, England recorded a clinical 42-21 victory to clinch yet another Grand Slam, with Holly Aitchison controlling things from fly-half. Saracens fly-half Harrison has edged out Aitchison for selection in this campaign because of her tactical kicking game, and that aspect of her game was illustrated in the opening score as her perfectly weighted grubber kick set up Dow. France came into the fixture undefeated but did suffer a scare in Italy last Saturday, when they were down at half-time and needed a second-half response to keep alive their Grand Slam hopes. Neat offloading got the visitors in behind England’s defence and the ball soon found its way to Arbez, who danced over for what looked to be a statement score. However, much of the opening period followed the events of the first half in Parma last week, as Sing went over for the first of her two straightforward finishes. Wing MacDonald added to her two tries in a player-of-the-match performance over Scotland last Saturday, with another sharp finish that followed tries by Atkin-Davies and Sing. With the Red Roses in complete control of the game, Harrison - after a low pass from Natasha Hunt - made the same mistake she did in Cardiff by dropping the ball on her own tryline and that was punished by Bourdon to give hope to France, who were down to 14 players with Assia Khalfaoui in the sin bin. When the prop returned from her punishment for a high tackle, France ended the half the stronger as Menager finished off some slick hands to close the gap to 10 points. This video can not be played England captain Aldcroft ‘so proud’ of Grand Slam winners The last time France travelled to Twickenham in 2023 they scored a remarkable 33 second-half points to almost produce a miracle comeback and snatch the Grand Slam. England made sure they started the second period quickly to prevent a repeat, Harrison showing off her running game to dummy and get in behind France’s defence and set up Aldcroft. France, however, refused to go away. Arbey fended off Sing and Dow to race clear for a magical score and continue another high-scoring thriller in Twickenham. Harrison continued her impressive response to the unexpected first-half fumble by supplying a long floated pass for Dow’s second. Unstructured rugby is when Les Bleues tend to be at their best and once things opened up Bourgeois and Grisez grabbed scores to help set up a grandstand finish, with those scores ensuring France surpassed their record from 2023 of points (33) scored against England. The clock was in the red as Harrison restarted the game and as Mitchell’s side walked to halfway the home crowd erupted in a show of support. A second eruption followed as France spilled the ball to conclude a pulsating finish. If both sides top their World Cup pool and win their quarter-finals they will meet in the final four of this year’s World Cup. Victory at Allianz Stadium maintains England’s invincible aura over France, which could prove pivotal come September in that potential semi-final meeting in Bristol. It was also Aldcroft’s final chance to lift a trophy in the same venue that hosts the World Cup final, as Mitchell’s grand plan for 2025 remains on track by the finest of margins. Former England fly-half Katy Daley-McLean on BBC Two: “At one point I didn’t want to look. Fair play to France. The game needed that finish, the Six Nations needed that finish. We don’t often see England under pressure that often but they delivered. ” Maggie Alphonsi, 2014 World Cup winner on BBC Two: “The Six Nations needed that jeopardy. It was a proper Test match and England should be proud the way they dug deep to win. They had to grind it out and you want that test before a World Cup. ” Former England hooker Brian Moore on BBC TV: “France gave so much to the game but it is about winning and England got over the line. In the first half there were periods where they did things very well but what they did not do is defend well enough at the breakdown. France played high risk rugby and it very nearly paid off. ” England: Sing; Dow, Jones, Heard, MacDonald; Harrison, Hunt; Botterman, Atkin-Davies, Muir, Talling, Ward, Aldcroft (capt), Feaunati, Matthews.

    "title": "New: Dog found using owner's t-shirt after 529 days in Australian wilderness",
    "body": "2025/04/26 - Experts revealed that A miniature dachshund has been found alive and well after spending more than 500 days in the Australian wilderness. Kangala Wildlife Rescue said it had been working “around the clock” to find the dog, Valerie, on Kangaroo Island, off the coast of Australia. She was last seen by her owners on a camping trip in November 2023. Georgia Gardner and her boyfriend, Joshua Fishlock, had momentarily left Valerie in a playpen at their campsite while the couple went fishing. When they returned, she was gone. Valerie’s 529 days in the wilderness - surviving intense heat and avoiding venomous snakes - was brought to an end in part through using Ms Gardner’s t-shirt to create a “scent trail” to a trap. “After weeks of tireless efforts […] Valerie has been safely rescued and is fit and well,” Kangala said in a social media post. The charity said volunteers spent more than 1,000 hours searching for Valerie, covering more than 5,000km (3,109 miles). The rescue effort included surveillance cameras and a trap cage with a remote door system filled with food, Ms Gardner’s clothes and some of Valerie’s toys from home. Lisa Karran, a director of Kangala, said she wore the remnants of Ms Gardner’s clothes as she approached Valerie after the dog had been trapped, and sat with her until the dog was “completely calm”. In the initial days after Valerie went missing, other campers spotted her underneath a parked car which startled the dog and sent her fleeing into bushland, the Washington Post reported. Months later, island locals reported seeing a pink collar that matched Valerie’s, much to the surprise of Jared Karran, another Kangala director. “Of all dogs, that would be the last one I would say would survive out there, but they do have a good sense of smell,” Mr Karran said. In a 15-minute video on social media, Mr and Ms Karran explained how the “rollercoaster” rescue had transpired. Ms Karran said they had to wait until Valerie was in the right part of the trap and calm enough to ensure she would not attempt another escape. “She went right into the back corner, which is where we wanted her. I pressed the button and thankfully it all worked perfectly,” Mr Karran said. “I know people were a little bit frustrated, like ‘why is it taking so long?’ But these are the things that we were doing in the background,” he said. Ms Gardner said on social media after Valerie’s long-awaited rescue: “For anyone who’s ever lost a pet, your feelings are valid and never give up hope. “Sometimes good things happen to good people. ” "

    "body": "2025/04/26 - According to new developments, The foul on Conor Turbitt earned Armagh the last-kick free which secured them a dramatic 0-23 to 0-22 Ulster Semi-Final win over Tyrone Rory Grugan scored a free with the last kick of the game as All-Ireland champions Armagh edged past fierce rivals Tyrone 0-23 to 0-22 to move into their third straight Ulster Senior Football final. In a hugely dramatic semi-final that burst into life in the second half in Clones, Tyrone moved two clear in the closing stages thanks to successive two-pointers from Peter Harte and Darren McCurry. But after Conor Turbitt and Eoin McElholm exchanged scores, Armagh scored the game’s final three points through Jarly Og Burns, Stefan Campbell and Grugan - after the hooter - to break Tyrone’s hearts in a gripping finale watched by 21,288 at St Tiernach’s Park. Armagh, who lost the 2023 and 2024 finals in penalty shootouts, will face the winner of Sunday’s semi-final between Donegal and Down in next month’s provincial decider on the weekend of 10/11 May. In a slow-burn semi-final played out in an intense atmosphere, Armagh were the better team in the first half and took a deserved 0-11 to 0-8 lead at the break. And while the impressive Oisin Conaty scored the second half’s first two points to move Armagh five up, Tyrone two-pointers from Conn Kilpatrick, Harte and McCurry helped swing the game in the Red Hands’ favour. But it wasn’t enough for Tyrone to reach their first Ulster final since 2021, with Malachy O’Rourke’s side now tasked with regrouping for the start of the All-Ireland round-robin stages next month. This video can not be played Highlights: Armagh snatch last-gasp win over Tyrone Already without Rian O’Neill, Armagh’s scoring power was further dented when Conor Turbitt - who missed the quarter-final win over Antrim - was withdrawn in one of three last-minute changes. But even without the flame-haired sharpshooter, Kieran McGeeney’s side had no trouble creating and scoring chances, as Oisin Conaty and Ross McQuillan scores and an Oisin O’Neill two-pointer put them 0-4 0-1 up after Darragh Canavan opened Tyrone’s account in the first minute. Canavan was Tyrone’s chief injury concern heading into the game after missing the win over Cavan last week. He was, however, deemed fit to start and lined up alongside his younger brother Ruairi, who replaced Peter Harte just before throw-in. But while the Canavan brothers only mustered a combined 0-1 in the first half, Darren McCurry (0-5) kept the scoreboard ticking over while an excellent two-pointer from Michael McKernan came at the right time when Tyrone trailed 0-6 to 0-3. Armagh, however, were more efficient and scored five of the first half’s last seven points - all from play - to lead by three at the break, with Ethan Rafferty, Andrew Murnin (2), Callum O’Neill and Oisin Conaty all raising white flags. Tyrone felt that Armagh keeper Ethan Rafferty should have been penalised for a challenge on Darragh Canavan during the second half Conaty, a standout for Armagh, scored two more at the start of the second half, and while Kilpatrick’s two-pointer helped keep Tyrone in it, the All-Ireland champions looked to be marching into the final when an unanswered three-score surge from Oisin O’Neill, Jarly Og Burns and Ben Crealey moved them 0-17 to 0-11 clear. But Tyrone kept chipping away and took control of the game in the third quarter with help from their bench. Eoin McElholm scored two from play after being introduced while Harte’s two-pointer produced the biggest roar of the day from the Red Hand fans. After Harte’s score, Armagh boss Kieran McGeeney was booked for dissent when he kicked a sideline flag on to the pitch. And when McCurry scored the resultant two-pointed free, Tyrone were 0-21 to 0-19 ahead. With six minutes remaining, it was a case of hanging on for Tyrone but Armagh refused to wilt and finished with a flourish as Jarly Og Burns and substitute Stefan Campbell fired over to level the score. Then, with Armagh in possession as the hooter sounded, Grugan found the onrushing Turbitt, who collided with Peter Harte and won the free that allowed Grugan to tap over the simplest of frees and set the Sam Maguire holders up for another crack at ending a 17-year wait for an Ulster title.

    "title": "Update: Ramsey 'gutted' after relegation but backs Cardiff for instant return",
    "body": "2025/04/26 - Experts revealed that Aaron Ramsey, who has 86 caps and 21 goals for Wales, has said he hopes to continue playing next season An emotional Aaron Ramsey was “gutted” by Cardiff City’s relegation to League One, but the caretaker manager believes they can make an instant return to the Championship if changes are made to the club’s structure. Wales captain Ramsey was taking charge of his second match as Cardiff’s relegation was confirmed with a goalless draw at home to West Bromwich Albion on Saturday. The 34-year-old midfielder faces an uncertain future as his Bluebirds contract expires at the end of this season, and he will not rush to make any decisions. “I don’t know [about next season]. Now is the time to digest everything over the next few weeks,” said Ramsey. “I’m gutted. I’m a fan as well. I’m sad to see this club going down. The fans have had a difficult time this season and I really feel for them. I know how they’re feeling. ” Cardiff relegated in draw with West Brom Latest Cardiff City news, analysis and fan views Ramsey believes the Cardiff players are not short on quality, despite their lowly standing. “I think if the right structures are in place with coaching staff and things, these players will give you everything,” he said. “If they can do that and give them the opportunities they deserve, then of course they’re more than capable of coming straight back up. “There’s a lot of quality in that team. They should be competing towards the top end of this league, never mind League One. ” Relegation had long seemed inevitable for Cardiff, who fell to the bottom of the Championship table, five points adrift of safety with one game remaining, following Saturday’s draw which left them with just one win in 14 matches. The Bluebirds had only narrowly avoided the drop in two of the previous three seasons, and this campaign was typically turbulent for the Welsh club. Ramsey became their third manager of the season when he took the reins for the final three games a week ago, succeeding Omer Riza, whose tenure lasted seven months following the departure of Erol Bulut. Cardiff have gone through 16 different managers during owner Vincent Tan’s 15-year tenure, with eight of those coming in the past four years. After the final whistle on Saturday, home fans applauded Cardiff’s players but chanted for Tan’s departure, having held protests against the club’s board earlier this season. Supporters, as well as several notable former players, believe the Bluebirds’ most significant issues are at board level, where there is an apparent lack of football knowledge.

It’s so, so important, because this club has got so much potential, it’s just about getting that right and it’s about responding to this and getting back quickly. ” "

    "title": "Big News: Ramsey 'gutted' after relegation but backs Cardiff for instant return",
    "body": "2025/04/26 - Here’s what you need to know: Aaron Ramsey, who has 86 caps and 21 goals for Wales, has said he hopes to continue playing next season An emotional Aaron Ramsey was “gutted” by Cardiff City’s relegation to League One, but the caretaker manager believes they can make an instant return to the Championship if changes are made to the club’s structure. Wales captain Ramsey was taking charge of his second match as Cardiff’s relegation was confirmed with a goalless draw at home to West Bromwich Albion on Saturday. The 34-year-old midfielder faces an uncertain future as his Bluebirds contract expires at the end of this season, and he will not rush to make any decisions. “I don’t know [about next season]. Now is the time to digest everything over the next few weeks,” said Ramsey. “I’m gutted. I’m a fan as well. I’m sad to see this club going down. The fans have had a difficult time this season and I really feel for them. I know how they’re feeling. ” Cardiff relegated in draw with West Brom Latest Cardiff City news, analysis and fan views Ramsey believes the Cardiff players are not short on quality, despite their lowly standing. “I think if the right structures are in place with coaching staff and things, these players will give you everything,” he said. “If they can do that and give them the opportunities they deserve, then of course they’re more than capable of coming straight back up. “There’s a lot of quality in that team. They should be competing towards the top end of this league, never mind League One. ” Relegation had long seemed inevitable for Cardiff, who fell to the bottom of the Championship table, five points adrift of safety with one game remaining, following Saturday’s draw which left them with just one win in 14 matches. The Bluebirds had only narrowly avoided the drop in two of the previous three seasons, and this campaign was typically turbulent for the Welsh club. Ramsey became their third manager of the season when he took the reins for the final three games a week ago, succeeding Omer Riza, whose tenure lasted seven months following the departure of Erol Bulut. Cardiff have gone through 16 different managers during owner Vincent Tan’s 15-year tenure, with eight of those coming in the past four years. After the final whistle on Saturday, home fans applauded Cardiff’s players but chanted for Tan’s departure, having held protests against the club’s board earlier this season. Supporters, as well as several notable former players, believe the Bluebirds’ most significant issues are at board level, where there is an apparent lack of football knowledge. There is no sporting director or director of football, with the running of the club left to Tan, chairman Mehmet Dalman and chief executive Ken Choo, none of whom have a background in the game and are seldom at games or the training ground. “Things are a little different to what I’ve experienced at other clubs. Normally you do have a head of football or a sporting director, things like that, who are overseeing everything, day-to-day operations, and they are aligned with the club,” said Ramsey. “But the biggest thing for me is making sure the right coaching staff is there, because they drive the right habits and create a culture. So that’s the most important thing, making the right decision in that and trusting the right person with that to bring in the right people around them, who has the team’s best interest at heart. “As long as that structure is OK you can get away with a lot of other things and you can give these players an opportunity. “At the end of the day, everyone has to look at themselves in the mirror and we have to be big enough to accept that.

    "body": "2025/04/26 - Here’s what you need to know: Quinn Roux’s try early in the second half marked the beginning of Bath’s second-half blitz in which they scored six tries Gallagher Premiership Bath 55 (17) Tries: Donoghue, Carr-Smith, Roux, Underhill, Emens 2, Hennessey, Redpath Cons: Donoghue 4, Russell 2 Pens: Donoghue Newcastle 19 (12) Tries: Neild, Doherty 2 Cons: Connon 2 Leaders Bath ran in eight tries in a dominant 55-19 win over bottom club Newcastle Falcons to ensure they will finish top of the Premiership and have a home play-off semi-final. In a scrappy opening littered with penalties, debutant Ciaran Donoghue struck first for the home side before Cameron Neild’s effort from the driving maul brought Newcastle within touching distance. Tom Carr-Smith then went over untouched following Louis Hennessey’s break, before Connor Doherty replied with both teams down to 14 men. Doherty got his second just after the break before tries for Quinn Roux, Sam Underhill, Hennessey, Cam Redpath and a brace from Austin Emens secured Bath’s position at the top of the table. Knowing that a bonus-point win would guarantee top spot in the Premiership with three games left to go, the home team started strongly. Making his top-flight debut, Donoghue scored a try-of-the-season contender as he burst through the Falcons defence and sidestepped the final defender to dot down over the line for Bath’s first. The expectant local crowd thought the home side had doubled the lead just minutes later when Falcons’ hooker Jamie Blamire overthrew a line-out, allowing Redpath to capitalise, only for the centre to be subsequently ruled off-side. Following repeated penalties, the Falcons forced themselves back into the game, putting points on the board with Neild driving over following a maul. Bath lost Underhill to the sin bin shortly afterwards for a high tackle, but it was not enough to prevent the home side from extending their lead. The Falcons repelled Bath through countless phases in their own 22, before Bath drew a penalty, which Donoghue slotted through the posts. Louis Hennessey then burst through a hole in the Falcons’ defence before unselfishly feeding Carr-Smith to add Bath’s second try, before the visitors were reduced to 14 following Louis Brown’s red card for a high, no-arms tackle on Emens. The cards kept on coming as Redpath saw yellow for a deliberate knock-on with Doherty exploiting the space in the ensuing phase to stride through the Bath defence, leaving Newcastle only five points down at half-time. Will Stuart was crucial to Bath’s victory as the west country team’s forward power began to tell in the second half Newcastle then gained a surprise lead just after the restart; Doherty cutting in on the arc following a line-out throw over the top from Blamire to leave the Bath defenders flailing. But the early riposte seemed to stir Bath into action and with it came a flurry of second-half tries. With Donoghue dictating things in the midfield, the fly-half’s break sent Roux through a gap, the second row barrelling towards the line with Falcons defenders helpless in his wake. Bath’s bonus-point try was soon to follow with Underhill powering his way over after yet another Donoghue break, before Emens came within inches of adding a fifth. The full-back then topped his all-action performance with two tries in succession. First came a diving effort in the corner after Bath’s replacements had driven into the Falcons’ half, with the second a mere stride over the line following Donoghue’s charge down the wing. Josh Bayliss created Bath’s seventh try, the back rower drawing the attention of three Falcons’ defenders before feeding Hennessey, who sprinted up the touchline before diving flamboyantly over the line. With Bath again down to 14 following a deliberate knock-on from Bayliss, Redpath added an eighth, which was the signal for the celebrations to begin as Johann van Graan’s side finish top of the table in the regular season for the first time since 2003-04. Bath head of rugby Johann van Graan told BBC Radio Bristol: “I thought the 23 produced some magic moments today. It wasn’t perfect but it gives us five points and puts us in an unassailable home semi-final position, on the weekend of 7 June. “A proud moment for the club, we’ll enjoy tonight then go back to zero. Still loads to play for in between now and then but I’m proud of all involved. [On the moment he was most proud of in the match] “The last defensive set, defended our line, turned the ball over, see an opportunity to come and score 100 yards down the other end. I think that sums up this team - tough to beat. It’s never done until it’s done. ” Newcastle Falcons senior coach Alan Dickens told BBC Radio Newcastle: “I said it after the game last week, coming here is a challenge we’ll look forward to and enjoy and relish in the week - which we did. “Unfortunately we didn’t quite get that bonus-point fourth try. “We were 17-5 down and we had the red card, the response they then showed for the next 15, 20 minutes to actually go in front was excellent. “Disappointing that we missed a couple of tackles on [Ciaran] Donoghue, I thought he had a fantastic game and deservedly got man of the match. We really should have been putting [the tackles] down and who knows where we would have been. ” Bath: Emens, McConnochie, Redpath, Butt, Hennessey; Donoghue, Carr-Smith; Van Wyk, Annett, Stuart, Roux, Ewels, Hill, Underhill, Barbeary. Replacements: Dunn, Du Toit, Griffin, Bayliss, Pepper, Schreuder, Russell, Tuipolotu. Yellow card: Underhill, Redpath, Bayliss. Newcastle: Brown, Hearle, Doherty, Clark, Stevenson; Connon, Stuart; Brocklebank, Blamire, Palframan, Hawkins, De Chaves, Lockwood, Neild, Chick. Replacements: Fletcher, Rewcastle, McCallum, Usher, Leatherbarrow, Pepper, Spencer, Arnold. Red card: Brown. Referee: Craig Maxwell-Keys "

The Parkhead club clinched a fourth successive top-flight crown by thrashing Dundee United 5-0 at Tannadice, and a win in next month’s Scottish Cup final would ensure a sixth domestic treble in nine campaigns. Saturday’s victory also brought an emotional Rodgers a fourth league triumph. “It feels like it’s been normalised when it really isn’t,” said the Northern Irishman, who is now the club’s third most successful manager. “It’s such a hard thing to do. From the first day of pre-season right the way through until the end, we’re going to push and fight to win as many trophies as we can. “We wanted to raise the flag for Celtic today and we’ve done that. We want to also perform well and the players were outstanding in that job as well. ” Celtic thrash Dundee Utd to clinch 13th title in 14 seasons What were the key games in Celtic’s title triumph? Latest Celtic news, analysis &amp; fan views This video can not be played ‘Big pressure, but it’s great when you have days like this’ Celtic have won 43 major honours since 2000, with 11 of them under Rodgers across two spells. The former Liverpool manager claimed every domestic prize he competed for during his first stint in Scotland before his controversial move to Leicester City. That mid-season switch back to the Premier League in 2019 made his return to Celtic difficult to accept for many fans. But Rodgers has won those supporters over by leading the team to more domestic success and progression in Europe. The 52-year-old said he had “never been happier” in Glasgow and was committed to delivering more silverware next season. “To be the manager here, it’s a real privilege,” he added. “But also I have that emotional connection as well. “That’s the joy of managing here. It’s big pressure, big expectation, but it’s great when you have days like this here. “My career until now has been great. I started on a journey as a young coach and have had the privilege to manage some amazing clubs. “However, like I said, there’s an emotional attachment here because of supporting the club and my family and friends. ” Captain Callum McGregor believes the “sky is the limit” for this team under Rodgers, but what is left for Celtic to achieve? In the short term, there is another a treble on the line when they face Aberdeen in next month’s Scottish Cup final at Hampden. If that is secured, the demand will be to repeat that feat again next term while continuing to make strides in Europe. After progressing to the knockout stage of the Champions League, Celtic were seconds away from earning a seismic second-leg win at Bayern Munich, which would have taken the German giants to extra time for a place in the last 16. Although Rodgers’ men will have to navigate one qualifying round next season, they will have aims to improve in Uefa’s premier club competition. But before they need to focus on that, there is another domestic clean sweep to achieve. “We have four league games left to try to arrive into the Scottish Cup final in the best moment,” McGregor said on Sky Sports. “If we do that, we have the chance to do something special this season. ” He added winning trebles was “the standard and expectation we’ve set”.

    "body": "2025/04/26 - Experts revealed that Wright has been an advocate of the women’s game for many years Ian Wright says he “cannot accept” Eni Aluko’s apology for suggesting the former England striker risked blocking female pundits from being given broadcasting opportunities. Wright, who is a pundit for various outlets on the men’s and women’s game, said he had seen the apology from the ex-England forward but wanted to move on from it. “I’m very disappointed by what Eni has said,” the 61-year-old Arsenal legend said. “She knows how I have helped her and supported her publicly. “I can’t accept it [the apology] but I also want to move on from it.

She apologised on Instagram on Friday, saying: “Ian Wright is a brilliant broadcaster and role model whose support for the women’s game has been significant. “In my interview with Woman’s Hour this week, I was trying to make a broader point about the limited opportunities for women in football - whether that’s in coaching, broadcasting or commercial spaces - and the importance of creating more space for women to thrive on and off the pitch. “But it was wrong for Ian’s name to be raised in that conversation, and for that I sincerely apologise.

    "body": "2025/04/26 - Experts revealed that The winner of the Ronnie O’Sullivan v Pang Junxu match will play Si Jiahui or Ben Woollaston in the quarter-finals Ronnie O’Sullivan built a 6-2 lead against China’s Pang Junxu as he dominated the first session of their last-16 match at the World Snooker Championship. O’Sullivan, 49, is aiming to become the first man in the modern era to win the event eight times and he remained on course to do so after pouncing on repeated mistakes from qualifier Pang, who is ranked 27th in the world. The match resumes at 14:30 BST on Sunday with O’Sullivan comfortably ahead. He will win with a session to spare in the unlikely event he claims seven of Sunday’s eight scheduled frames. O’Sullivan had won the closing five frames in his 10-4 success over Ali Carter in round one and raced into a 4-0 lead against Pang, aided by breaks of 58, 91, 50 and 63. Pang made a 119 break in frame five, but that was his only run above 50. He had a chance to end only two frames behind, but another miss in frame eight helped O’Sullivan inch a step closer to the winning target in the best-of-25-frame match. Three-time world champion Mark Williams became the second man to move into the quarter-finals as he battled past Iran’s Hossein Vafaei, earning a 13-10 win. Wales’ Williams turned 50 in March and he becomes the oldest player to reach the last eight at the Crucible since six-time winner Steve Davis did so in 2010 at the age of 52. Williams held a 9-7 advantage after the second session on Friday and he took two of the first three frames on Saturday. Qualifier Vafaei made breaks of 74 and 72 to narrow the gap to 11-10, but Williams was not to be denied and pressed on towards the winning post, fashioning a stylish 115 to seal his victory. Englishman Chris Wakelin became the first man through to the last eight when he defeated Northern Ireland’s Mark Allen on Friday. John Higgins and Xiao Guodong will have to finish off their last-16 match late on Saturday evening The second-round match between John Higgins and Xiao Guodong will go to a late-night finish, with the Scot 12-11 in front and needing one more frame to reach the quarter-finals. Only seven of the scheduled nine frames could be completed in Saturday’s opening session. With the afternoon session scheduled to begin at 14:30 BST, Higgins and Xiao were hauled off shortly before 14:15. Higgins squandered a glorious chance to wrap up victory as he led 53-33 in the 23rd frame but missed a black off the spot before Xiao kept his tournament hopes alive. They will resume on the first available table after Saturday’s scheduled evening matches. The match was tied at 8-8 when they resumed in the morning, and Xiao, ranked 14th in the world, made a break of 76 to move 9-8 ahead. Four-time world champion Higgins responded by taking the next two frames to nudge in front at 10-9. The 20th frame lasted more than 62 minutes, with Higgins unable to convert a 46-25 lead before Xiao finally produced a fine pot on the pink to take it. Higgins responded well with a break of 84 and then took the 22nd frame to move one away from victory. But after Higgins’ missed black in frame 23, Xiao held his nerve with a run of 36 to stay in the tournament and force the tie into a late finish. As well as his trophy wins, Higgins, 49, has lost in four further finals at the Crucible, gone out in the semi-finals on three occasions and fallen at the last-eight hurdle seven times, including the past two seasons. ‘O’Sullivan definitely a contender’ ‘National hero’ - China’s pursuit of an elusive world title Keeping up with the Woollastons - snooker’s family affair World Championship: Schedule, results &amp; BBC coverage "

    "body": "2025/04/26 - Let’s dive into the details: A van appears to have been driven slowly into Just Stop Oil (JSO) protesters as hundreds marched through London for their “last day of action”. A mass of people wearing JSO’s orange vests rallied in Westminster on Saturday after the group claimed a victory on new oil and gas licences and said “we’re hanging up the hi vis”. The group has drawn attention, criticism and jail terms for protests ranging from throwing soup on Vincent van Gogh’s Sunflowers and spray-painting Charles Darwin’s grave, to climbing on M25 gantries. During the march, a man in a white minivan appeared to edge it forwards until it was pressed against protesters. Police appeared to successfully call for the crowd to move away. The minivan was also carrying a child and at least one other passenger. People standing front of the vehicle, some holding a JSO banner, were seen holding their hands up, with one shouting to the police “officer, I’m being pushed back”. The driver exited the vehicle and could be heard remonstrating with the protesters about the road being blocked. Police reminded the man the disruption was temporary and people had a right to protest. Other similar incidents of drivers apparently becoming frustrated with people in the road were also caught on camera. In its March statement announcing the end of direct action, the group said: “Just Stop Oil’s initial demand to end new oil and gas is now government policy, making us one of the most successful civil resistance campaigns in recent history. “We’ve kept over 4. 4 billion barrels of oil in the ground and the courts have ruled new oil and gas licences unlawful. ” The Labour government has said it will not issue licences for new oil and gas exploration, while a series of recent court cases have halted fossil fuel projects including oil drilling in Surrey, a coal mine in Cumbria and the Rosebank and Jackdaw fields in the North Sea over climate pollution. Labour has distanced itself from Just Stop Oil, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer criticising its actions and saying protesters must face the full force of the law.

    "title": "New: Sutton's Premier League & FA Cup semi-final predictions v golf superstar Lee Westwood",
    "body": "2025/04/26 - According to new developments, Liverpool appear certain to win the Premier League and could seal the title this weekend, but picking the FA Cup winners is a much tougher task. Crystal Palace play Aston Villa in the first semi-final, live on BBC One on Saturday (17:15 BST), before Nottingham Forest face Manchester City at Wembley on Sunday. “It’s refreshing that the FA Cup is so wide open,” said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton. “City will be seen as favourites to go on and lift it, but we know they are not the same team they were in the past few seasons. ” As well as the FA Cup, Sutton is making predictions for every Premier League game this season against a variety of guests. For all of this weekend’s games in both competitions, he takes on golf superstar and Forest fan, Lee Westwood. You can watch Westwood play for Majesticks GC, external at the LIV Golf event in Mexico this weekend, on ITVX. Do you agree with their predictions? You can make your own choices below. The most popular scoreline selected for each Premier League game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page. A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points. As well as following Forest, Westwood is a Worksop Town fan - he sponsored their shirts for several years - and is hoping to see them win promotion to the Conference North this season. “I always look to see how they are getting on,” he said. “They have been on a good run and are in the play-offs - it’s been a great season for them, too. ” Westwood will be watching Sunday’s game from Mexico and is hoping Forest can wrap up victory before he starts his round. “I am going to get to the course early and watch it there, then go and warm up because we are playing in the afternoon,” he told BBC Sport. “If it goes to extra time then I won’t see that… but we will have won by then, obviously!” Forest won promotion to the Premier League in a play-off final at Wembley in 2022 but Sunday is their first visit to the old or new national stadium in a cup semi-final or final since the 1992 League Cup final, when they lost to Manchester United. “I am really looking to it,” Westwood added. “For starters it is a massive occasion for the club to be in an FA Cup semi-final for the first time since 1991, and going to Wembley and facing a hugely successful team like City have been in the past few years. “It will be tough, but the fact we are in this scenario is a testament to where Forest have got to this season, and what a great year we have had. “We are fourth after City’s win in midweek and people are saying how we could miss out on the Champions League but you just have to think back to where we were 12 months ago, when we only just stayed up. “To now hear some Forest fans moaning that we are going to miss out on the Champions League shows what an incredible season this has been for us - and by the way, I do think we will finish in the top five. “With the run-in we have got compared to some of the other teams, I wouldn’t say for certain we will make it but I am very optimistic. ” Forest and City have one win apiece from their games in the Premier League this season, but the result Westwood wants a repeat of is their last meeting in the FA Cup. “Let’s roll the clock back to 2009,” he said. “We were a Championship team then but we shocked City 3-0 at the Etihad in the third round. “It was the day they paraded Wayne Bridge as one of their first big signings. “I was there with a load of my mates who support City and to be there and see us win the way we did was one of - if not the best - day of my life. My mates didn’t talk to me afterwards though. ” Chris Sutton and Lee Westwood were speaking to BBC Sport’s Chris Bevan. Westwood (front, centre) was at Wembley to see Forest win promotion in 2022 and is hoping for a return visit for next month’s FA Cup final There are no replays in the FA Cup semi-finals. Games will be decided by extra time and penalties. Gap = league places between the two teams Premier League, Stamford Bridge, 12:30 BST Chelsea 1-0 Everton The worry for Everton is it looks like James Tarkowski is out for the season with the hamstring injury he sustained against Manchester City. That is a massive blow for them at the back, because they did not look the same team defensively once he went off. Everton are without striker Armando Broja too, because he is on loan from Chelsea and cannot face his parent club, but I feel like he has kind of been on trial in the past couple of games anyway. David Moyes has been having a look at Broja, probably to weigh up whether or not to sign him permanently in the summer, but Everton are probably better off with Beto leading their attack. He will be a threat running in behind when they try to break forward, and Abdoulaye Doucoure will try get up there too in support. They might get some joy here because while Chelsea are still in the mix for the top five after their fightback to beat Fulham, things are clearly still not right with them. An element of their fans are just not having Enzo Maresca and his style of play, and it will be interesting to see how the Stamford Bridge crowd react if things don’t go to plan on Saturday. I am really not convinced by Chelsea’s attack at the moment, especially with Cole Palmer and Nicolas Jackson so out of form. Even with Tarkowski missing, they could struggle to break Everton down. Sutton’s prediction: 1-1 Lee’s prediction: I can see Everton getting something here. 1-1 Premier League Amex Stadium, 15:00 BST Brighton 3-2 West Ham Both of these teams are badly in need of a win - Brighton have gone five games without a victory, while West Ham are on a run of six. There are a lot of unhappy Hammers fans at the moment, especially after they could only draw with Southampton last week. That is not the kind of result that wins fans over, and seeing Graham Potter take Jarrod Bowen off with the score at 1-0 did not help. Potter has picked up fewer points per game since taking charge than his predecessor, Julen Lopetegui, and I don’t see much changing for him on his return to the Amex, where he had a much happier time. Brighton have issues too - their form has fallen off a cliff of late and their supporters are not pleased with the way they are finishing the season either. They have still had a decent campaign, but they have become leaky at the back and they could do with a positive result or two if they are going to stay in with a chance of making it into Europe. Sutton’s prediction: 2-1 Lee’s prediction: Not much to play for here. 2-1 Premier League St James’ Park, 15:00 BST Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds. Newcastle 3-0 Ipswich It’s great news that Newcastle boss Eddie Howe will be back in the dug-out for this game after his stay in hospital. I don’t see his side having any trouble securing the three points here, based on what I saw from Ipswich against Arsenal last week. That was game just wasn’t a contest, even before Leif Davis was sent off. There is a lot at stake for the Magpies in the race for Champions League qualification, while it is just a matter of time until Ipswich’s relegation is confirmed. We might see some anger in Newcastle’s performance after their heavy defeat by Aston Villa but, ultimately, this should be a comfortable win for them. Sutton’s prediction: 3-0 Lee’s prediction: I don’t see Newcastle dropping points, unfortunately for Forest. I’m good friends with Alan Shearer but I have gone quiet with him about Forest since Newcastle beat us home and away in the league this season. They beat us on their way to winning the Carabao Cup as well so I haven’t been able to wind him up too much, but I’ll be in touch if we finish above them. 4-1 Premier League St Mary’s Stadium, 15:00 BST Southampton 1-2 Fulham Southampton’s draw with West Ham means they have equalled the points tally of Robbie Savage’s useless Derby County side in 2007-08, but I still feel my 606 co-host has to go down as the Premier League’s worst-ever captain. I take my hat off to Saints fans, because they have stuck with their team through such a dismal season - and maybe they will have something to celebrate when they play Leicester next week. I don’t see them getting anything here, though. Fulham will be annoyed at letting their lead slip against Chelsea last time out, but they have got more quality than Southampton, and they will make it count. Sutton’s prediction: 0-2 Lee’s prediction: Do you know what, I am going to go with Southampton to get a draw. I am just hoping they get a point so they can beat the points total that Derby got a few years ago, because I would hate to see Derby lose that record! 2-2 Premier League Molineux, 15:00 BST Wolves 3-0 Leicester How can you back against Wolves here? They are the Premier League’s most in-form team based on the past five games, while it is an awfully long time since Leicester enjoyed a victory full-stop. Pablo Sarabia’s brilliant free-kick gave Wolves their win at Old Trafford last week, and I don’t think that result surprised anyone. There is talk about Matheus Cunha leaving them to join Manchester United in the summer, but you would think he would set his sights a bit higher. Leicester’s relegation was confirmed by their defeat against Liverpool and, from top to bottom, the club is in a mess. They are only playing for pride now, and I don’t see them getting any points here. Sutton’s prediction: 2-0 Lee’s prediction: Wolves have really hit form with five wins in a row. 3-1 FA Cup semi-final Wembley, 17:15 BST 12th in Premier League v 7th in Premier League Gap = 5 Last major trophy? Palace: Never. Villa: 1996 League Cup Best FA Cup run? Palace: runners-up in 1990 &amp; 2016. Villa: winners x7 between 1887 &amp; 1957 Watch live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website. Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds. It’s interesting how Palace have got a good record against Villa this season. They knocked then out of the Carabao Cup at Villa Park in October, led twice when they drew there in the league in November and then beat them 4-1 at Selhurst Park in February. That will give the Eagles some confidence and, if they play like they did against Arsenal on Wednesday, they have got a great chance of getting through. They rested Jean-Philippe Mateta at the Emirates Stadium but created loads of chances and should have won. It was a very different Palace performance to the one I watched when I was at St James’ Park last week, when they were torn apart by Newcastle, so it’s hard to know what to expect here. The fact Villa have struggled against them this season shows what Palace are capable of, given how good Unai Emery’s side have been. As well as the FA Cup, Villa are still in the race for the top five and did so well to reach the Champions League quarter-finals too. Emery deserves a bit of silverware to reflect the excellent job he has done but we know football doesn’t work like that. Villa were unlucky to lose to Manchester City on Tuesday but the question is whether they have got another big performance in them, like the ones they have produced in Europe. My head tells me that if Villa turn up then Palace won’t beat them again, but I still think this will be extremely close and it will go to extra-time before Villa’s bench wins it for them. Sutton’s prediction: 2-3 after extra-time Lee’s prediction: I fancy Villa. They have got a very strong squad. 1-3 Premier League Vitality Stadium, 14:00 BST Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds. Bournemouth hammered Manchester United 3-0 at Old Trafford before Christmas and they have to be heavy favourites to win this game too. United travel to play Athletic Bilbao in the first leg of their Europa League semi-final next Thursday, and Ruben Amorim has already spoken about how he will prioritise that competition over the Premier League. So, Amorim will play more younger players here and on top of that, although Bournemouth are not on a great run of results, they are still in better form than United are. I am backing Bournemouth and it is going to be tough for United against Bilbao too. Bilbao got the better of Rangers in the last round and I am expecting two pretty tight games. Rangers did have some opportunities, though, so United have got a chance if they can click going forward. Having the second leg at Old Trafford will help Amorim’s side, too. Sutton’s prediction: 2-1 Lee’s prediction: Bournemouth are tough to beat at their place. 2-1 Premier League Anfield, 16:30 BST Liverpool only need a point to make sure of the title, and it is going to happen against Tottenham on Sunday. There is an argument that Spurs, and Manchester United too, should go strong in these Premier League games to try to find the rhythm they have been lacking all season, and get the team playing the way we know they can to help them in their Europa League semi-finals. But I don’t see Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou doing that before his side play Bodo/Glimt on Thursday, and I can only see one outcome. Liverpool have hardly been that sharp of late but they will be determined to win the title in front of their own fans for the first time in 35 years. They were not able to do that when they last won the title in 2020 because of the Covid regulations at the time, so doing it now is a big deal for them. I am expecting them to raise their game and blow Spurs away to get the job done. Sutton’s prediction: 4-1 Lee’s prediction: Liverpool would like to win it there, wouldn’t they? Tottenham might rest people, and Forest have just beaten them. They haven’t got much incentive to do anything to stop Liverpool. 3-0 FA Cup semi-final Wembley, 16:30 BST 4th in Premier League v 3rd in Premier League Gap = 1 Last major trophy? Forest: 1990 League Cup. City: 2024 Premier League Best FA Cup run? Forest: winners in 1898 &amp; 1959. City: winners x7 between 1904 &amp; 2023 Live commentary on 5 Live Sports Extra and BBC Sounds. Pep Guardiola’s team selection will be absolutely crucial here. Both of Manchester City’s goals against Aston Villa on Tuesday came from their players being prepared to run at defenders - firstly Omar Marmoush and then Jeremy Doku, who had started the game on the bench. But Pep appears to be very cautious at the moment, and has not been using his out-and-out wingers, Doku or Savinho, very much because he wants to try to control the middle of the pitch. Doku and Savinho both started when Forest beat City at the beginning of March, which was City’s last defeat, seven games ago, but it’s unlikely that they will both start at Wembley. That does not make this tie any easier to call, though. Forest bounced back from a couple of defeats with a win over Tottenham on Monday, which was a huge result for their top-five hopes, and we know the way they are set up to counter-attack can cause City problems. I am not just saying this because Forest were my boyhood team, but I want anyone but City to win the FA Cup this season. I’ve got nothing against City but it would be a great story if any of the other three teams won it because they have either not won anything for so long or, in Palace’s case, they have never won a major trophy at all. Despite that, I just have a feeling that City are going to put in a good performance here, and earn the right to reach their third straight FA Cup final. As much I hate to say it, I am expecting Pep to find a way to win, the same way they did against Everton and Aston Villa - although I hope I am wrong. My predictions are so bad at the moment, there is a good chance I will be. Sutton’s prediction: 1-2 Lee’s prediction: It will be tough but I do think we can turn them over. I am not just saying that because I’m a Forest fan, it’s because we seem to have played well against the better teams this season, the ones that come on to us. I’ve seen the stats about possession and we have got the lowest average possession (39. 3%) in the Premier League this season, and City have got the highest (61. 6%) so they are going to have the ball and we will try to hit them on the break - we have already beaten them this season, so we know it can work. One late breakaway goal would do the job, and that’s the way we play. 1-0 Chris got five correct results, with no exact scores, from the 10 games in week 33, giving him 50 points. He was beaten by his guest, DJ and producer Sherelle, who got four correct results including one exact score, for a total of 70 points. But the win went to the BBC readers, thanks to their spot-on prediction of Forest’s 2-1 win over Tottenham on Monday. That meant they ended up with six correct results with one exact score, for a total of 90 points. There were also two midweek Premier League games, both moved forward from this weekend because of the FA Cup semi-finals. Sherelle made the prediction for the first game, Manchester City’s win over Aston Villa on Tuesday and picked up 40 points for the guests’ overall total with an exact score. Chris and the BBC readers both went for a 2-1 Villa win. No-one picked up any extra points from Arsenal’s draw with Crystal Palace on Wednesday. Chris, Lee Westwood and the BBC readers all went for a Gunners victory. "

Brighton have issues too - their form has fallen off a cliff of late and their supporters are not pleased with the way they are finishing the season either. They have still had a decent campaign, but they have become leaky at the back and they could do with a positive result or two if they are going to stay in with a chance of making it into Europe. Sutton’s prediction: 2-1 Lee’s prediction: Not much to play for here. 2-1 Premier League St James’ Park, 15:00 BST Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds. Newcastle 3-0 Ipswich It’s great news that Newcastle boss Eddie Howe will be back in the dug-out for this game after his stay in hospital. I don’t see his side having any trouble securing the three points here, based on what I saw from Ipswich against Arsenal last week. That was game just wasn’t a contest, even before Leif Davis was sent off. There is a lot at stake for the Magpies in the race for Champions League qualification, while it is just a matter of time until Ipswich’s relegation is confirmed. We might see some anger in Newcastle’s performance after their heavy defeat by Aston Villa but, ultimately, this should be a comfortable win for them. Sutton’s prediction: 3-0 Lee’s prediction: I don’t see Newcastle dropping points, unfortunately for Forest. I’m good friends with Alan Shearer but I have gone quiet with him about Forest since Newcastle beat us home and away in the league this season. They beat us on their way to winning the Carabao Cup as well so I haven’t been able to wind him up too much, but I’ll be in touch if we finish above them. 4-1 Premier League St Mary’s Stadium, 15:00 BST Southampton 1-2 Fulham Southampton’s draw with West Ham means they have equalled the points tally of Robbie Savage’s useless Derby County side in 2007-08, but I still feel my 606 co-host has to go down as the Premier League’s worst-ever captain. I take my hat off to Saints fans, because they have stuck with their team through such a dismal season - and maybe they will have something to celebrate when they play Leicester next week. I don’t see them getting anything here, though. Fulham will be annoyed at letting their lead slip against Chelsea last time out, but they have got more quality than Southampton, and they will make it count. Sutton’s prediction: 0-2 Lee’s prediction: Do you know what, I am going to go with Southampton to get a draw. I am just hoping they get a point so they can beat the points total that Derby got a few years ago, because I would hate to see Derby lose that record! 2-2 Premier League Molineux, 15:00 BST Wolves 3-0 Leicester How can you back against Wolves here? They are the Premier League’s most in-form team based on the past five games, while it is an awfully long time since Leicester enjoyed a victory full-stop. Pablo Sarabia’s brilliant free-kick gave Wolves their win at Old Trafford last week, and I don’t think that result surprised anyone. There is talk about Matheus Cunha leaving them to join Manchester United in the summer, but you would think he would set his sights a bit higher. Leicester’s relegation was confirmed by their defeat against Liverpool and, from top to bottom, the club is in a mess. They are only playing for pride now, and I don’t see them getting any points here. Sutton’s prediction: 2-0 Lee’s prediction: Wolves have really hit form with five wins in a row. 3-1 FA Cup semi-final Wembley, 17:15 BST 12th in Premier League v 7th in Premier League Gap = 5 Last major trophy? Palace: Never. Villa: 1996 League Cup Best FA Cup run? Palace: runners-up in 1990 &amp; 2016. Villa: winners x7 between 1887 &amp; 1957 Watch live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website. Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds. It’s interesting how Palace have got a good record against Villa this season. They knocked then out of the Carabao Cup at Villa Park in October, led twice when they drew there in the league in November and then beat them 4-1 at Selhurst Park in February. That will give the Eagles some confidence and, if they play like they did against Arsenal on Wednesday, they have got a great chance of getting through. They rested Jean-Philippe Mateta at the Emirates Stadium but created loads of chances and should have won. It was a very different Palace performance to the one I watched when I was at St James’ Park last week, when they were torn apart by Newcastle, so it’s hard to know what to expect here. The fact Villa have struggled against them this season shows what Palace are capable of, given how good Unai Emery’s side have been. As well as the FA Cup, Villa are still in the race for the top five and did so well to reach the Champions League quarter-finals too. Emery deserves a bit of silverware to reflect the excellent job he has done but we know football doesn’t work like that. Villa were unlucky to lose to Manchester City on Tuesday but the question is whether they have got another big performance in them, like the ones they have produced in Europe. My head tells me that if Villa turn up then Palace won’t beat them again, but I still think this will be extremely close and it will go to extra-time before Villa’s bench wins it for them. Sutton’s prediction: 2-3 after extra-time Lee’s prediction: I fancy Villa. They have got a very strong squad. 1-3 Premier League Vitality Stadium, 14:00 BST Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds. Bournemouth hammered Manchester United 3-0 at Old Trafford before Christmas and they have to be heavy favourites to win this game too. United travel to play Athletic Bilbao in the first leg of their Europa League semi-final next Thursday, and Ruben Amorim has already spoken about how he will prioritise that competition over the Premier League. So, Amorim will play more younger players here and on top of that, although Bournemouth are not on a great run of results, they are still in better form than United are. I am backing Bournemouth and it is going to be tough for United against Bilbao too. Bilbao got the better of Rangers in the last round and I am expecting two pretty tight games. Rangers did have some opportunities, though, so United have got a chance if they can click going forward. Having the second leg at Old Trafford will help Amorim’s side, too. Sutton’s prediction: 2-1 Lee’s prediction: Bournemouth are tough to beat at their place. 2-1 Premier League Anfield, 16:30 BST Liverpool only need a point to make sure of the title, and it is going to happen against Tottenham on Sunday. There is an argument that Spurs, and Manchester United too, should go strong in these Premier League games to try to find the rhythm they have been lacking all season, and get the team playing the way we know they can to help them in their Europa League semi-finals. But I don’t see Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou doing that before his side play Bodo/Glimt on Thursday, and I can only see one outcome. Liverpool have hardly been that sharp of late but they will be determined to win the title in front of their own fans for the first time in 35 years. They were not able to do that when they last won the title in 2020 because of the Covid regulations at the time, so doing it now is a big deal for them. I am expecting them to raise their game and blow Spurs away to get the job done. Sutton’s prediction: 4-1 Lee’s prediction: Liverpool would like to win it there, wouldn’t they? Tottenham might rest people, and Forest have just beaten them. They haven’t got much incentive to do anything to stop Liverpool. 3-0 FA Cup semi-final Wembley, 16:30 BST 4th in Premier League v 3rd in Premier League Gap = 1 Last major trophy? Forest: 1990 League Cup. City: 2024 Premier League Best FA Cup run? Forest: winners in 1898 &amp; 1959. City: winners x7 between 1904 &amp; 2023 Live commentary on 5 Live Sports Extra and BBC Sounds. Pep Guardiola’s team selection will be absolutely crucial here. Both of Manchester City’s goals against Aston Villa on Tuesday came from their players being prepared to run at defenders - firstly Omar Marmoush and then Jeremy Doku, who had started the game on the bench. But Pep appears to be very cautious at the moment, and has not been using his out-and-out wingers, Doku or Savinho, very much because he wants to try to control the middle of the pitch. Doku and Savinho both started when Forest beat City at the beginning of March, which was City’s last defeat, seven games ago, but it’s unlikely that they will both start at Wembley. That does not make this tie any easier to call, though. Forest bounced back from a couple of defeats with a win over Tottenham on Monday, which was a huge result for their top-five hopes, and we know the way they are set up to counter-attack can cause City problems. I am not just saying this because Forest were my boyhood team, but I want anyone but City to win the FA Cup this season. I’ve got nothing against City but it would be a great story if any of the other three teams won it because they have either not won anything for so long or, in Palace’s case, they have never won a major trophy at all. Despite that, I just have a feeling that City are going to put in a good performance here, and earn the right to reach their third straight FA Cup final. As much I hate to say it, I am expecting Pep to find a way to win, the same way they did against Everton and Aston Villa - although I hope I am wrong. My predictions are so bad at the moment, there is a good chance I will be. Sutton’s prediction: 1-2 Lee’s prediction: It will be tough but I do think we can turn them over. I am not just saying that because I’m a Forest fan, it’s because we seem to have played well against the better teams this season, the ones that come on to us. I’ve seen the stats about possession and we have got the lowest average possession (39. 3%) in the Premier League this season, and City have got the highest (61. 6%) so they are going to have the ball and we will try to hit them on the break - we have already beaten them this season, so we know it can work. One late breakaway goal would do the job, and that’s the way we play. 1-0 Chris got five correct results, with no exact scores, from the 10 games in week 33, giving him 50 points. He was beaten by his guest, DJ and producer Sherelle, who got four correct results including one exact score, for a total of 70 points. But the win went to the BBC readers, thanks to their spot-on prediction of Forest’s 2-1 win over Tottenham on Monday. That meant they ended up with six correct results with one exact score, for a total of 90 points. There were also two midweek Premier League games, both moved forward from this weekend because of the FA Cup semi-finals. Sherelle made the prediction for the first game, Manchester City’s win over Aston Villa on Tuesday and picked up 40 points for the guests’ overall total with an exact score. Chris and the BBC readers both went for a 2-1 Villa win. No-one picked up any extra points from Arsenal’s draw with Crystal Palace on Wednesday. Chris, Lee Westwood and the BBC readers all went for a Gunners victory. "

    "title": "Breaking: Sutton's Premier League & FA Cup semi-final predictions v golf superstar Lee Westwood",
    "body": "2025/04/26 - Here’s what you need to know: Liverpool appear certain to win the Premier League and could seal the title this weekend, but picking the FA Cup winners is a much tougher task. Crystal Palace play Aston Villa in the first semi-final, live on BBC One on Saturday (17:15 BST), before Nottingham Forest face Manchester City at Wembley on Sunday. “It’s refreshing that the FA Cup is so wide open,” said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton. “City will be seen as favourites to go on and lift it, but we know they are not the same team they were in the past few seasons. ” As well as the FA Cup, Sutton is making predictions for every Premier League game this season against a variety of guests. For all of this weekend’s games in both competitions, he takes on golf superstar and Forest fan, Lee Westwood. You can watch Westwood play for Majesticks GC, external at the LIV Golf event in Mexico this weekend, on ITVX. Do you agree with their predictions? You can make your own choices below. The most popular scoreline selected for each Premier League game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page. A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points. As well as following Forest, Westwood is a Worksop Town fan - he sponsored their shirts for several years - and is hoping to see them win promotion to the Conference North this season. “I always look to see how they are getting on,” he said. “They have been on a good run and are in the play-offs - it’s been a great season for them, too. ” Westwood will be watching Sunday’s game from Mexico and is hoping Forest can wrap up victory before he starts his round. “I am going to get to the course early and watch it there, then go and warm up because we are playing in the afternoon,” he told BBC Sport. “If it goes to extra time then I won’t see that… but we will have won by then, obviously!” Forest won promotion to the Premier League in a play-off final at Wembley in 2022 but Sunday is their first visit to the old or new national stadium in a cup semi-final or final since the 1992 League Cup final, when they lost to Manchester United. “I am really looking to it,” Westwood added. “For starters it is a massive occasion for the club to be in an FA Cup semi-final for the first time since 1991, and going to Wembley and facing a hugely successful team like City have been in the past few years. “It will be tough, but the fact we are in this scenario is a testament to where Forest have got to this season, and what a great year we have had. “We are fourth after City’s win in midweek and people are saying how we could miss out on the Champions League but you just have to think back to where we were 12 months ago, when we only just stayed up. “To now hear some Forest fans moaning that we are going to miss out on the Champions League shows what an incredible season this has been for us - and by the way, I do think we will finish in the top five. “With the run-in we have got compared to some of the other teams, I wouldn’t say for certain we will make it but I am very optimistic. ” Forest and City have one win apiece from their games in the Premier League this season, but the result Westwood wants a repeat of is their last meeting in the FA Cup. “Let’s roll the clock back to 2009,” he said. “We were a Championship team then but we shocked City 3-0 at the Etihad in the third round. “It was the day they paraded Wayne Bridge as one of their first big signings. “I was there with a load of my mates who support City and to be there and see us win the way we did was one of - if not the best - day of my life. My mates didn’t talk to me afterwards though. ” Chris Sutton and Lee Westwood were speaking to BBC Sport’s Chris Bevan. Westwood (front, centre) was at Wembley to see Forest win promotion in 2022 and is hoping for a return visit for next month’s FA Cup final There are no replays in the FA Cup semi-finals. Games will be decided by extra time and penalties. Gap = league places between the two teams Premier League, Stamford Bridge, 12:30 BST Chelsea 1-0 Everton The worry for Everton is it looks like James Tarkowski is out for the season with the hamstring injury he sustained against Manchester City. That is a massive blow for them at the back, because they did not look the same team defensively once he went off. Everton are without striker Armando Broja too, because he is on loan from Chelsea and cannot face his parent club, but I feel like he has kind of been on trial in the past couple of games anyway. David Moyes has been having a look at Broja, probably to weigh up whether or not to sign him permanently in the summer, but Everton are probably better off with Beto leading their attack. He will be a threat running in behind when they try to break forward, and Abdoulaye Doucoure will try get up there too in support. They might get some joy here because while Chelsea are still in the mix for the top five after their fightback to beat Fulham, things are clearly still not right with them. An element of their fans are just not having Enzo Maresca and his style of play, and it will be interesting to see how the Stamford Bridge crowd react if things don’t go to plan on Saturday. I am really not convinced by Chelsea’s attack at the moment, especially with Cole Palmer and Nicolas Jackson so out of form. Even with Tarkowski missing, they could struggle to break Everton down. Sutton’s prediction: 1-1 Lee’s prediction: I can see Everton getting something here. 1-1 Premier League Amex Stadium, 15:00 BST Brighton 3-2 West Ham Both of these teams are badly in need of a win - Brighton have gone five games without a victory, while West Ham are on a run of six. There are a lot of unhappy Hammers fans at the moment, especially after they could only draw with Southampton last week. That is not the kind of result that wins fans over, and seeing Graham Potter take Jarrod Bowen off with the score at 1-0 did not help. Potter has picked up fewer points per game since taking charge than his predecessor, Julen Lopetegui, and I don’t see much changing for him on his return to the Amex, where he had a much happier time. Brighton have issues too - their form has fallen off a cliff of late and their supporters are not pleased with the way they are finishing the season either. They have still had a decent campaign, but they have become leaky at the back and they could do with a positive result or two if they are going to stay in with a chance of making it into Europe. Sutton’s prediction: 2-1 Lee’s prediction: Not much to play for here. 2-1 Premier League St James’ Park, 15:00 BST Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds. Newcastle 3-0 Ipswich It’s great news that Newcastle boss Eddie Howe will be back in the dug-out for this game after his stay in hospital. I don’t see his side having any trouble securing the three points here, based on what I saw from Ipswich against Arsenal last week. That was game just wasn’t a contest, even before Leif Davis was sent off. There is a lot at stake for the Magpies in the race for Champions League qualification, while it is just a matter of time until Ipswich’s relegation is confirmed.

    "body": "2025/04/26 - Experts revealed that Mullins is the first Irish-based trainer since Vincent O’Brien in the 1950s to lift the UK jumps trophy Willie Mullins claimed a treble on the final day of the British jump racing season at Sandown to get the better of rival Dan Skelton and retain his trainers’ title. Wins for Celtic Warrior (5-6 favourite) in the Oaksey Chase, Il Etait Temps (9-2) in the Celebration Chase and Jump Allen (5-1) in the Handicap Hurdle finale, plus the second, third, fourth and fifth-placed finishers in the Bet365 Gold Cup, ensured a day to remember for the 68-year-old Irishman. English trainer Skelton had led the way for much of the year-long season and was more than Â£1m ahead in the championship - which is based on prize money - before the Grand National on 5 April. But Mullins, the first Irish trainer to win the British title for 70 years in 2024, saddled five of the first seven in the big Aintree race, including a one-two-three, to cut the deficit by Â£860,000. Skelton led by Â£68,483 going into the last day with Â£685,000 prize money on offer across the card. But Mullins had the stronger hand with 21 runners compared to Skelton’s nine and trained the first two in the Oaksey Chase with Appreciate It following stablemate Celtic Warrior home to close the money gap, before seizing the advantage when Il Etait Temps beat the Nicky Henderson-trained Jonbon to win the Celebration Chase. It was a fifth Grade One success for the winner, who had been off the track for almost a year, but Danny Mullins, nephew of the trainer, put in a superb ride to take a deserved victory. Skelton needed a big performance in the Gold Cup to have any chance of the title but it was newly crowned champion jockey Sean Bowen who triumphed on Resplendent Grey (9-2), trained by Olly Murphy, while Mullins horses filled the next four places to give him the title. It was the perfect way for Welsh rider Bowen to complete his season, which also seen him pass 1,000 winners in February and make up for disappointment of the 2023-24 campaign. Last season he had been leading the standings before a fall on Boxing Day left him sidelined for two months, allowing rival Harry Cobden to overtake him and win his first title. But this season Bowen finished with 180 wins with Cobden in second on 143, ending his campaign with a win on the Mullins-trained Jump Allen in the final race of the season. The day also saw rising star Freddie Gingell crowned champion conditional jockey, while JP McManus won the champion owner title.

Wins for Gaelic Warrior (5-6 favourite) in the Oaksey Chase, Il Etait Temps (9-2) in the Celebration Chase and Jump Allen (5-1) in the Handicap Hurdle finale, plus the second, third, fourth and fifth-placed finishers in the Bet365 Gold Cup, ensured a day to remember for the 68-year-old Irishman. English trainer Skelton had led the way for much of the year-long season and was more than Â£1m ahead in the championship - which is based on prize money - before the Grand National on 5 April. But Mullins, the first Irish trainer to win the British title for 70 years in 2024, saddled five of the first seven in the big Aintree race, including a one-two-three, to cut the deficit by Â£860,000. Skelton led by Â£68,483 going into the last day with Â£685,000 prize money on offer across the card. But Mullins had the stronger hand with 21 runners compared to Skelton’s nine and trained the first two in the Oaksey Chase with Appreciate It following stablemate Gaelic Warrior home to close the money gap, before seizing the advantage when Il Etait Temps beat the Nicky Henderson-trained Jonbon to win the Celebration Chase. It was a fifth Grade One success for the winner, who had been off the track for almost a year, but Danny Mullins, nephew of the trainer, put in a superb ride to take a deserved victory. Skelton needed a big performance in the Gold Cup to have any chance of the title but it was newly-crowned champion jockey Sean Bowen who triumphed on Resplendent Grey (9-2), trained by Olly Murphy. Mullins horses filled the next four places to give him the title although Dancing City suffered a fatal injury. For Bowen, victory was the perfect way for the Welsh rider to complete his season, which also saw him pass 1,000 winners in February and make up for the disappointment of the 2023-24 campaign. Last season he had been leading the standings before a fall on Boxing Day left him sidelined for two months, allowing Harry Cobden to overtake him and win his first title. But this season Bowen finished on 180 wins with Dan Skelton’s brother Harry in second on 143, and third-placed Cobden ending his campaign with a win on the Mullins-trained Jump Allen in the final race of the season. The day also saw rising star Freddie Gingell crowned champion conditional jockey, while JP McManus won the champion owner title.

    "title": "Update: Thousands line streets of Rome as Pope Francis laid to rest after Vatican funeral",
    "body": "2025/04/26 - Experts revealed that Pope Francis has been buried in Rome after a funeral ceremony and procession attended by hundreds of thousands of people and many heads of state. The first South American pontiff passed away on Monday aged 88, marking the end of a 12-year pontificate. As the Italian capital woke up to a hazy morning, teenage pilgrims, nuns and priests of all denominations filed silently down the streets leading to the Vatican. Many of the streets around St Peter’s Basilica were closed - both to allow the flow of visitors and for security reasons, as more than a hundred foreign dignitaries were expected to join the funeral mass. More than 8,000 Italian police of different branches were out in force, as well as firefighters, medics, canine unit handlers, volunteers, members of the armed forces and even park guards. Many had been called in from all sides of Italy to be in Rome today - resulting in a rather joyous blend of accents from across the country, from the Sicilian to the Milanese. By 08:00 local time (06:00 GMT) much of the square was already full. Jessica, 22 and from Mexico, and Cyril, 20 and from the US, had arrived at dawn to secure a front row spot to the funeral mass. “We never thought we’d be this close. We sacrificed a little sleep to be here but it’s worth it,” said Jessica. She’s a Catholic and said her relatives in Mexico would “never believe it” when she told them she had been at the Vatican for the Pope’s funeral. As heads of state and foreign dignitaries took their places to the right of the altar, hundreds of photographers in the press area on the roof of the colonnade snapped their cameras furiously, hoping to capture a candid image of US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whose last meeting in February gave rise to a combative exchange in the Oval Office. But soon after, as a striking photo of the two men sitting on two chairs inside St Peter’s began to circulate, it emerged that they had already met for around 15 minutes before the service began. Later, Zelensky said the meeting “had potential to become historic, if we achieve joint results”. No more details were shared, but some on social media later joked that, given the setting, the meeting had been a “miracle”. Photos showed that UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Trump, Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron had also all met in the Vatican. From the bright red of the clergy’s habits to the muted grey and blue of nuns’ veils to the rainbow sun hats worn by pilgrims, all morning St Peter’s Square was a riot of colours glistening in the sun. Hymns played out on giant speakers, occasionally drowned out by the sound of helicopters flying overhead, as drones and seagulls crisscrossed over Michelangelo’s dome. Yet the voice of 91-year-old Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re rang loud and clear as he presided over the mass. The service’s structure was very similar to that of any Catholic funeral mass, although the readings were done in many different languages and all hymns were sung in Latin. Outside St Peter’s, a crowd the Vatican later said numbered 200,000 applauded as large screens showed Zelensky take his seat. There was also applause when the Pope’s simple wooden coffin was brought out. The crowd’s applause marked some other salient moments - such as when Cardinal Re, as part of his homily, remembered the Pope’s commitment to migrants and peace. He mentioned that the Pope’s first trip had been to the Italian island of Lampedusa, the port of arrival in Europe for many migrants who make the perilous journey across the Mediterranean, and recalled the mass the Pope celebrated at the US-Mexico border. “War, he said, results in the death of people and the destruction of homes, hospitals and schools. War always leaves the world worse than it was before: it is always a painful and tragic defeat for everyone. ” The cardinal emphasised that Pope Francis had repeatedly urged the world to “build bridges, not walls”. “It was good to hear that on a day when so many heads of state were on St Peter’s Square,” a woman called Maria told the BBC. She and her friend Grazia had flown in from Sardinia especially for the funeral. “It was a message especially for them, I think, because it’s them who decide whether there’s going to be war or peace, not us… Let’s hope something made it through to them. ” “Otherwise them being here was just pure hypocrisy,” added Grazia. During communion, a procession of white-clad priests made its way down St Peter’s Square, carrying golden chalices full of wafers for communion, as many in the large crowd moved forward to receive the hosts. Soon after, Cardinal Re blessed the Pope’s coffin with holy water, before burning incense in a thurible - a symbol of cleansing - and the basilica’s bells tolled three times after the blessing of the coffin was carried out. After some brief mingling, world leaders started making their way out of the basilica. Their motorcades then filed out of the Vatican. Within an hour Trump was reported to be back on Air Force One, while other leaders held various informal meetings in Rome. Meanwhile, the Pope’s coffin was carried through Rome in a slow procession to the church of Santa Maria Maggiore for burial. Authorities said 140,000 had lined the streets, clapping and waving as the hearse – a repurposed white popemobile – crossed the Tiber river and drove past some of Rome’s most recognisable sights: the Colosseum, the Forum and the Altare della Patria national monument on Piazza Venezia. Once the coffin reached Santa Maria Maggiore, it was taken inside and the live broadcast ceased. Pope Francis was buried in the righthand side of the church, near a beloved icon of the Virgin Mary, at around 15:00. Visitors, pilgrims and the clergy vacated St Peter’s Square quickly. Many could be seen minutes later in the numerous cafes, restaurants and pizzerias of the historic Borgo Pio neighbourhood nearby. Grazia from Sardinia said the funeral had made a big impression on her. “It was wonderful to meet in a single square with people who come from every corner of the world and to live a shared moment. This is the legacy of the Pope,” she said. Officials said the day had unfolded without any major incidents. “Four hundred thousand people shared a historic and emotional moment, and thanks to everyone’s commitment the day took place in a solemn and serene way, without critical issues,” said the head of the Civil Protection, Fabio Ciciliano. The city of Rome and the Catholics of the world will now be preparing for the next momentous event - the conclave, which will select the next Pope. A date has not yet been set but it is thought it could start as early as 5 or 6 May, after the Novemdiales - the mandatory nine days of mourning - are over. With 135 cardinals set to attend, it will be the largest conclave in modern history and one of the most unpredictable. Over the past few days, cardinals wandering around Rome were hounded by journalists trying to get a steer on what the conclave might yield. After the funeral, too, the Cardinal of Tonga Soane Patita Paini Mafi was approached by the media as he made his way out of St Peter’s Square. After a South American pope, is it time for an Asian one, he was asked. Cardinal Mafi laughed and pointed to the sky. “Only He knows,” he said. "

    "title": "Update: Russia claims it has regained full control of Kursk from Ukraine",
    "body": "2025/04/26 - According to new developments, Ukraine has denied Russian claims that it has been forced out of Russia’s Kursk region. Valery Gerasimov, chief of staff of Russia’s military, said his forces had regained full control of the region, eight months after Ukrainian forces first launched a surprise incursion into the border region, while Russian President Vladimir Putin described Ukraine’s efforts as a complete failure. Ukraine says its troops are still conducting operations in Kursk, with the military describing Russia’s claims as “propaganda tricks”. Ukrainian forces have been in retreat in Kursk in recent months, facing 70,000 Russian troops and heavy drone attacks as part of Russia’s drive to regain the territory. During a video conference meeting with Putin on Saturday, Gerasimov said: “Today, the last settlement in the Kursk region, the village of Gornal, has been liberated from Ukrainian forces. ” He praised what he described as the “heroism” of North Korean troops who had “provided significant assistance in defeating the group of Ukrainian armed forces”. “The Kyiv regime’s adventure has completely failed,” Putin told Gerasimov, claiming that it would pave the way for further Russian advances on other fronts. Responding in a post on Telegram, the Ukrainian military’s general staff said the situation on the battlefield was “difficult” but insisted its forces were still holding positions in Kursk and continuing an incursion in Russia’s Belgorod region. Ukraine’s incursion was launched last August as an attempt to create a buffer zone on the border between the two countries that would prevent Russian forces from being deployed on Ukraine’s eastern front line. It comes a day after US President Donald Trump said Russia and Ukraine were “very close to a deal” on ending the war, following talks between his envoy Steve Witkoff and Putin this week. Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ahead of Pope Francis’s funeral at the Vatican on Saturday. Zelensky told the BBC on Friday that he was pushing for a “full and unconditional ceasefire” before any deal was struck. Kyiv has faced growing pressure from Trump to accept territorial concessions as part of any deal with Moscow to end fighting, which could reportedly include giving up the Crimean peninsula which was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014. Ukraine had hoped it could use the land it had seized in the Kursk region as a bargaining chip in future peace talks with Russia, which launched its full invasion in 2022 and has currently controls around 20% of Ukraine’s internationally-recognised territory. Russia says its troops are now at the border with Ukraine’s Sumy region, located next to Kursk. "

    "body": "2025/04/26 - Here’s what you need to know: This video can not be played Scotland edge out Ireland thanks to late McGhie try Women’s Six Nations Scotland (12) 26 Tries: Skeldon, Orr, Malcolm, McGhie Cons: Nelson (3) Ireland (7) 19 Tries: Costigan, Djougang, Lane Cons: O’Brien (2) Francesca McGhie’s late try snatched a dramatic victory for Scotland against Ireland in the Women’s Six Nations. Ireland dominated the first half and struck first through an Amee-Leigh Costigan try, but scores from Lana Skeldon and Emma Orr sent Scotland in at 12-7 in front at half-time. Linda Djougang and Emily Lane scored for Ireland either side of a Rachel McLachlan try for the hosts before McGhie’s score in the final play sealed an extraordinary win. Ireland remain third in the table while Scotland move up to fourth before Italy host Wales on Sunday. After dominant away victories against Italy and Wales, the Irish were looking to make it three from three on the road in the championship and they made the perfect start. Molly Scuffil-McCabe spotted a gap in the Scotland fringe defence and turned on the burners to break free before finding Costigan to go over for a brilliant try. Scotland were struggling to get a foothold in the game but their lineout was functioning well and that was their route back into the match. A lineout on the Ireland five metre line was won and, when the rolling maul rumbled over the line, it was hooker Skeldon left holding the ball after touching down for her 19th try in Scotland colours. The visitors came back strongly and pounded the Scotland try line. Only some heroic defence kept Ireland at bay, with Djougang held up twice over the line. This video can not be played ‘Scintillating break’ - Costigan scores Ireland opener Scotland were hanging on and it looked for all the world like Ireland would burst the dam until second row Sarah Bonar pounced for an interception and kicked ahead to take the play into the Ireland 22. Ireland scrambled back but could not get the ball off the field in the final play of the half. The Scots showed great composure and engineered space for Orr to slalom through for a superb score and give the home side an unlikely five-point lead at the break. Djougang was not to be denied her try and ploughed over to level things up at 12-12, and Scotland’s cause was hampered further when Rhona Lloyd was sent to the sin bin for head-to-head contact with Costigan in the build-up to the score. While some accuracy was lacking in their game, the Scots were doggedly staying in the game and when they got their chance of a rare foray into Ireland territory, they took their chance superbly. The ball was whipped wide to Chloe Rollie and she fended off a tackle before slipping a beautiful pass out the back door for McLachlan to dive over in the corner. In a match where they had been under the cosh for large spells, the home side now led 19-12. But Ireland were undeterred and continued to put pressure on Scotland, most notably at scrum time. The home side were barely back to their full complement when they lost another player to a yellow card, this time Helen Nelson for an infringement at a ruck as the Scots became more desperate in their defence of their try line. The pressure eventually told when substitute Lane dived over and O’Brien slotted over the conversion to make it all square again. There was one final twist when McGhie went over in the corner to pull a victory out the fire at the end of a breathless contest. "

    "body": "2025/04/26 - It has been recently reported that This video can not be played Scotland edge out Ireland thanks to late McGhie try Women’s Six Nations Scotland (12) 26 Tries: Skeldon, Orr, Malcolm, McGhie Cons: Nelson (3) Ireland (7) 19 Tries: Costigan, Djougang, Lane Cons: O’Brien (2) Francesca McGhie’s late try snatched a dramatic victory for Scotland against Ireland in the Women’s Six Nations. Ireland dominated the first half and struck first through an Amee-Leigh Costigan try, but scores from Lana Skeldon and Emma Orr sent Scotland in at 12-7 in front at half-time. Linda Djougang and Emily Lane scored for Ireland either side of a Rachel McLachlan try for the hosts before McGhie’s score in the final play sealed an extraordinary win. Ireland remain third in the table while Scotland move up to fourth before Italy host Wales on Sunday. After dominant away victories against Italy and Wales, the Irish were looking to make it three from three on the road in the championship and they made the perfect start. Molly Scuffil-McCabe spotted a gap in the Scotland fringe defence and turned on the burners to break free before finding Costigan to go over for a brilliant try. Scotland were struggling to get a foothold in the game but their lineout was functioning well and that was their route back into the match. A lineout on the Ireland five metre line was won and, when the rolling maul rumbled over the line, it was hooker Skeldon left holding the ball after touching down for her 19th try in Scotland colours. The visitors came back strongly and pounded the Scotland try line. Only some heroic defence kept Ireland at bay, with Djougang held up twice over the line. This video can not be played ‘Scintillating break’ - Costigan scores Ireland opener Scotland were hanging on and it looked for all the world like Ireland would burst the dam until second row Sarah Bonar pounced for an interception and kicked ahead to take the play into the Ireland 22. Ireland scrambled back but could not get the ball off the field in the final play of the half. The Scots showed great composure and engineered space for Orr to slalom through for a superb score and give the home side an unlikely five-point lead at the break. Djougang was not to be denied her try and ploughed over to level things up at 12-12, and Scotland’s cause was hampered further when Rhona Lloyd was sent to the sin bin for head-to-head contact with Costigan in the build-up to the score. While some accuracy was lacking in their game, the Scots were doggedly staying in the game and when they got their chance of a rare foray into Ireland territory, they took their chance superbly. The ball was whipped wide to Chloe Rollie and she fended off a tackle before slipping a beautiful pass out the back door for McLachlan to dive over in the corner. In a match where they had been under the cosh for large spells, the home side now led 19-12. But Ireland were undeterred and continued to put pressure on Scotland, most notably at scrum time. The home side were barely back to their full complement when they lost another player to a yellow card, this time Helen Nelson for an infringement at a ruck as the Scots became more desperate in their defence of their try line. The pressure eventually told when substitute Lane dived over and O’Brien slotted over the conversion to make it all square again. There was one final twist when McGhie went over in the corner to pull a victory out the fire at the end of a breathless contest. "

    "title": "Latest: Hall 'starting from scratch' as London  awaits",
    "body": "2025/04/26 - Here’s what you need to know: Hall has been competing at the highest level from a young age An enforced break through illness followed by the arrival of her two children has meant a rollercoaster few years for two-time Paralympic wheelchair racer Jade Hall. But with a renewed enthusiasm for the sport, she will line up in Sunday’s London Marathon just 13 months after giving birth to her daughter via Caesarean section. Under her maiden name of Jones, the Middlesbrough racer, who was mentored by Paralympic great Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson and Grey-Thompson’s husband Ian from the age of 12, made her Great Britain debut aged 15 and competed at European and World Championships and at the London and Rio Paralympics. She then switched to Para-triathlon, winning Commonwealth gold for England in 2018 in Australia, and was training for the Tokyo Paralympics before the Covid pandemic and then illness intervened. In mid-2020, after initially feeling like she had flu, Hall was diagnosed with pericarditis â inflammation of the lining around the heart, external which can cause chest pain and discomfort - and after recovering made the decision to take a break from elite sport and miss the Games. “There was definitely a point where I didn’t think I was going to be able to race again,” the 29-year-old told BBC Sport. “I was ill for about eight months and in that time everything was hard. My heart rate was elevated when I was just walking around and that was causing chest pains and other symptoms. “From training every day to not being to train at all and not even being able to even go out for a walk or do something simple was pretty tough. “I made the decision to focus on my recovery and forget about the Games because I needed to get healthy again and live a normal life. ” Hall and her husband and fellow wheelchair racer Callum decided to focus on having a family and after welcoming son Luca in February 2023, she returned to training and competed in the Manchester 10K race when he was 12 weeks old. Shortly afterwards, she discovered she was pregnant again and Bonnie arrived in March 2024. “I’ve had a period of almost three years of being in and out of training and with the Caesarean, it’s like I’ve started from scratch,” she said. “I feel like I’ve had a career before children and a career after and it’s really hard to compare the two because they’re just very different. “Before I became unwell I was kind of feeling a bit tired and I felt like I didn’t really know which direction I was going in. “Having that forced break with the illness and then having the children made me realise that I do really love it. ” Hall’s family play an important part in her sporting life Hall finished seventh in the New York Marathon in November, seven months after Bonnie’s birth, and on Sunday returns to London, which she last raced in 2018. The field for the women’s race is led by two-time winner and Paralympic champion Catherine Debrunner of Switzerland and American Susannah Scaroni, who won Monday’s Boston Marathon. Briton Eden Rainbow-Cooper will hope to improve on her fourth place in Boston after struggling with a back injury since early last year. In the men’s race, Swiss ‘Silver Bullet’ Marcel Hug will be aiming for his fifth win in a row - and seventh overall - to close in on David Weir’s record of eight victories. For Hall, who is now focused solely on wheelchair racing rather than triathlon, the next Paralympics in Los Angeles in 2028 are a consideration but her short-term goals are more important. “LA is at the back of my mind but I want to see how the next year goes and how I can earn my place back on the marathon circuit, so I feel like it’s one step at a time for me right now,” she said. “I’m not just sacrificing my time any more, I’m sacrificing time with the children to go and train. “I’m enjoying it - probably more than I ever have - and I want my children to be able to see me doing something positive with my life “Now it just feels different and it feels like it’s bigger because it’s a part of their life too. ” London Marathon 2025 - everything you need to know ‘Once a fool to become an expert’ - Yee set for marathon debut ‘Our daughters will be with us,’ say dads of Southport victims running London Marathon "

    "title": "Update: Gregg Wallace seeks 'space to heal' after saying claims against him 'not all true'",
    "body": "2025/04/26 - Experts revealed that Gregg Wallace has said he needs “space to heal” after stating in an interview that allegations against him of inappropriate sexual comments were “not all true”. A BBC News investigation revealed allegations of inappropriate sexual comments by 13 people who had worked with Wallace across a range of shows, over a 17-year-period. He told the Daily Mail “they’re not all true”, and said he had felt “under attack” and had contemplated suicide. In an Instagram post after the interview was published, the former MasterChef presenter said he knew there would be “a lot of noise” following the Mail interview but he “won’t be joining in”. Wallace has faced further claims of “groping” and “touching” since the original allegations. He strenuously denies them. MasterChef’s production company, Banijay, has launched an inquiry into the historical allegations. In a post on Instagram Wallace said he “meant every word” of his Mail interview. “It was hard to do, but speaking honestly for myself, my family and especially my mum, felt right,” he wrote. He said he now needed “space to heal and be with the people who know who I really am”. In his first interview since the claims emerged, Wallace said that he had received “a tidal wave of abuse” on social media after posting a video on Instagram hitting out at his accusers. In the video, which he subsequently apologised for, he said the claims against him had come from “a handful of middle-class women of a certain age”. “News channels were updating hourly with new allegations,” he said. “You’re watching yourself get personally ripped apart, criticised, accused of all sorts of stuff over and over again. You’re thinking, this isn’t true. It isn’t true. What’s coming next?” Wallace said he couldn’t sleep at the time, adding: “The feeling of being under attack, of isolation, of abandonment was overwhelming. Nobody from the BBC contacted me once these stories started breaking – absolutely nobody at all. ” The BBC and Banijay declined to comment. Wallace said that at the time, his mother called him to ask why people were “picking on him”. He said he responded: “I’ve said something really stupid. They’re investigating my behaviour, but more and more people are coming forward with complaints about me. Mum, they’re not all true. I haven’t done these things. ” Wallace revealed that his mother recently died, adding that it was “terribly sad” that she had spent the last few days of her life reading “horrible things” about him. One of the women who spoke to BBC News as part of its investigation was broadcaster Kirsty Wark who appeared on Celebrity MasterChef. Wark accused Wallace of telling “sexualised jokes” during the filming of the show, and said that it left people feeling “uncomfortable”. But Wallace says he was never aware he had offended her until it came to light last year, saying: “I thought we got on. ” Other high-profile media personalities, including Vanessa Feltz and Kirstie Allsopp, also spoke up at the time. Wallace said that Feltz’s complaint “knocked him for six”, and also pushed back against Allsopp’s comments about his language, saying: “I wouldn’t have said that. ” Writing on Instagram in November, singer Sir Rod Stewart described Wallace as an “ill-mannered bully”, and said the presenter “humiliated” his wife Penny Lancaster when she was on Masterchef in 2021. Addressing that claim, Wallace said it was a “shame” as he liked Sir Rod. He acknowledged there had been a “falling out” between himself and Lancaster, but said it was over “whether an orchid should stay on a bowl of soup or not”. He also addressed other allegations that emerged towards the end of last year, including one that he’d walked around on set naked with a sock on his penis. He admitted to putting a “sock over my private bits” and opening his dressing room door shouting “hooray”, but claimed he did this to three friends who were in the studio after filming had finished, rather than while it was taking place. He admitted that some of the inappropriate jokes were “probably true”, saying: “Some of what’s been said sounds like the sort of comments I’d have made. ” But he insisted he never groped any workers, calling those claims “absolutely not true”. He also said that many of those who work with him had been supportive, including John Torode, his co-presenter on MasterChef. Torode has not responded to a request for comment. When Banijay launched an inquiry, Wallace said his “world tumbled in”. “It’s very difficult to explain the pressure unless you’ve been through it. I thought about suicide all the time: “Is my insurance up to date? Will [Wallace’s wife] Anna get some money? She doesn’t deserve this. It would be better if I wasn’t here. ” He told the newspaper Banijay had arranged for a crisis mentor to support him. Wallace said he was recently diagnosed with autism, saying: “I want to make it absolutely clear I’m not blaming my behaviour on my diagnosis, but it does explain a hell of a lot to me. ” He added that he accepts he was “very slow to wake up” to a changing work environment. “It wasn’t until seven years ago that I had a massive wake-up call and realised the loud, energetic greengrocer persona I was on the telly was, maybe, becoming redundant. So I changed. ” “I honestly never meant to upset anyone. I thought I was going in every day and just delivering what was wanted. I didn’t realise I was causing any problems. ” Wallace has been one of Britain’s most high profile presenters for more than two decades. BBC News, which is editorially independent from the wider organisation, started investigating Wallace last summer, after becoming aware of allegations. The claims were made across five shows, from 2005 to 2022. Most of the allegations came from production workers. Many were young female freelancers. Allegations heard include Wallace talking openly about his sex life, taking his top off in front of a female worker saying he wanted to “give her a fashion show”, and telling a junior female colleague he wasn’t wearing any boxer shorts under his jeans. BBC News has also heard from a former MasterChef worker who says he showed her topless pictures of himself and asked for massages, and a former worker on Channel 5’s Gregg Wallace’s Big Weekends, who says he was fascinated by the fact she dated women and asked for the logistics of how it worked. Another female worker on MasterChef in 2019 says Wallace talked about his sex life; a female worker on the BBC Good Food Show in 2010 says Wallace stared at her chest; and a male worker on MasterChef in 2005-06 says Wallace regularly said sexually explicit things on set. After BBC News’s initial investigation, more women came forward with claims. One woman says he touched her bottom at an event and another says he pressed his crotch against her while filming on a different show. His lawyers have strongly denied he engages in behaviour of a sexually harassing nature. Wallace has repeatedly declined interview requests from BBC News. If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story, information and support can be found at the BBC’s Action Line. "

    "body": "2025/04/26 - It has been recently reported that The Dragons were easy winners over Wigan Warriors in last year’s final Two-time defending Wheelchair Challenge Cup winners Catalans Dragons have been removed from the 2025 competition by tournament organisers after a dispute over international matches. The French side were set to face Halifax Panthers in the quarter-finals next month. But the Rugby Football League (RFL) said Catalans’ invitation to compete had been withdrawn “in response to a refusal by the French Federation to play any international fixtures against England until next autumn’s World Cup”. England and France are the leading international sides in the world rankings, with England the World Cup holders having beaten their French rivals in Manchester in 2022. They have faced each other in double-headers at the end of the last two seasons, but England will be travelling to Australia later this year for a four-Test series. The Dragons, who have England international Seb Bechara in their ranks, won the French Cup final earlier this month. They have dominated the Challenge Cup since their first appearance in 2022, reaching the final three times and winning in 2023 and 2024. Their removal from the draw means Halifax, who have Bechara’s international team-mate Jack Brown back in their ranks after a spell in Australia, receive a bye into the last four. "

    "body": "2025/04/26 - Experts revealed that The death of Virginia Giuffre will leave questions that are now likely to remain unanswered. Her name will always be associated with the scandals and criminality surrounding the late billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his circle - with Ms Giuffre one of the most prominent among his accusers, revealing the trafficking and sexual exploitation of young women. The photo of her and Prince Andrew, taken in London in 2001, became emblematic of the royal’s entanglement with Epstein and was central to his disastrous Newsnight interview in 2019. The origins of the picture remain uncertain. But Ms Giuffre’s death adds another layer to the mystery of what must have inadvertently become one of the most widely viewed photos in royal history. Epstein - who was said to have taken the photo - died in jail facing sex trafficking charges. Ghislaine Maxwell - who helped him abuse young girls and is pictured to the right of Prince Andrew and Ms Giuffre - is in prison in the US. Prince Andrew has stepped down from all public duties. And Virginia Giuffre, a smiling teenager in the photo, is now dead. Ms Giuffre - who was born in the US - died by suicide at her farm in Western Australia aged 41, her family said on Friday. Prince Andrew has always strongly denied any wrongdoing involving Ms Giuffre. They reached an out-of-court settlement in 2022, in which Prince Andrew paid an undisclosed amount of money. A statement with the settlement expressed regret on his part - but contained no admission of liability or an apology. Prince Andrew has always denied all the accusations against him. The prospect of Prince Andrew facing a court hearing in New York was averted by the settlement, but it had been a huge problem for the Royal Family, and Prince Andrew was swiftly removed from all official public roles. His reputation has never recovered. At this stage, there is still much that is not known about Ms Giuffre’s last days or her personal circumstances. But as her family has said, as a young woman, she had the strength to stand up to a toxic mix of power, money and privilege in the circle surrounding Epstein, that sexually exploited so many girls.

Sofia Maatta and Nicole Kozlova scored in the first half and Katie Lockwood added two more after the break as the nine-time winners booked a return to the national stadium to face either holders Rangers or Aberdeen on 25 May. Underdogs Well frustrated City for more than half an hour, but Glasgow’s pressure told when Emily Whelan escaped Emma Lawton and crossed for Maatta to tap into an empty net. Maatta then unselfishly set up Kozlova, who rounded Emily Mutch to finish in first-half stoppage time. Kozlova had moments earlier watched in frustration as she nudged the ball past Mutch, only for Jenna Penman to hack clear on the goal line. Kozlova also shot tamely at Mutch at 0-0 and Whelan headed wide before setting up the opener. Whelan was the provider for Lockwood’s second-half strike, laying the ball across for an emphatic finish. Maatta was denied a second by Mutch soon after and Brenna Lovera netted from an offside position at a corner as the City onslaught continued. Replays suggested Lovera may in fact have been onside. Samantha van Diemen’s excellent long ball was met with an equally good first touch by Lockwood and the midfielder kept her cool to beat Mutch once again.

However, their achievements in securing a SWPL top-six finish and reaching the last four of the Scottish Cup give them cause for optimism for next season.

It’s no different as a manager but it’s all about the players. It’s about them getting their hands on the trophy, so they’ve done the hard work getting themselves into the final and we can go and look forward to that. ” Motherwell manager Paul Brownlie: “At 1-0, we still had control without the ball. We had a good structure about us, defensively we were sound at points in the game but the second goal almost kills the game. “That’s two visits to Hampden in three years, which is an incredible achievement for a club like Motherwell, it’s about growing and getting better. “It’s still pretty raw and we don’t want to lose games, but I’ve got to think of the bigger picture. ” "

    "body": "2025/04/26 - Let’s dive into the details: Original Coronation Street star Philip Lowrie has died aged 88. Lowrie, who appeared in the first episode of the ITV soap in 1960 as the original bad boy Dennis Tanner, died on Friday, his publicist Mario Renzullo said. “My client and very dear friend, Philip Lowrie, the beloved actor renowned for his role as Dennis Tanner on Coronation Street, passed away yesterday,” he said. “His death marks the end of an era for the world’s longest-running soap, where he became a cornerstone of its storytelling. ” Lowrie was born in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester. When the soap started more than six decades ago, Lowrie’s character was seen as a national heartthrob thanks to his roguish role. Dennis was introduced as the son of Elsie Tanner, and moved in with his mother after being released from prison. Lowrie had originally auditioned for the role of Ken Barlow prior to the show’s launch, and appeared in the first episode at the age of 24. William Roache was soon cast as Ken for the beginning of the soap and became a regular sparring partner for Dennis. He left the Street in 1968, when he married Jenny Sutton and moved to Bristol, and did not return until 2011. According to Mr Renzullo, Lowrie was presented in September 2011 with a certificate by the Guinness World Records for being the person with the longest gap between television appearances as the same character in the same show. Dennis soon got back in touch with newsagent Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox), who was his sweetheart when she first appeared in the show in 1966, and they tied the knot when he came back. He left the soap again in 2014 and was later killed off without making another appearance on screen. Lowrie’s mother saved for his fees to go to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada) in London after he left school. After graduating three years later, he soon received his first parts in the West End, appearing with Dame Margaret Rutherford and Peggy Mount in the play Farewell, Farewell, Eugene. He also appeared on Victoria Wood’s comedy shows, such as Victoria Wood’s All Day Breakfast, Victoria Wood, Pat and Margaret, Live In Your Own Room, We’d Quite Like To Apologise, Victoria Wood As Seen On TV, and Wood And Walters. His later stage lead roles in the 2000s and 2010s included being in Dame Agatha Christie’s The Mousetrap, The Case Of The Frightened Lady and The Lady Vanishes.

    "body": "2025/04/26 - Experts revealed that A woman who wrote on a statue using lipstick during unrest in the Brazilian capital in 2023 has been jailed for 14 years. Debora Rodrigues took part in the unrest along with hundreds of supporters of former president Jair Bolsonaro, who attacked government buildings following his election loss the previous year. The 29-year-old was convicted of involvement with a criminal organisation aiming to launch a coup and eliminate the democratic rule of law. Justice Cristiano Zanin, one of a panel of five judges overlooking Rodrigues’s case, stressed she was not being tried solely for the graffiti and was convicted of multiple offences, but many in Brazil believe her sentence is too harsh. Supporters of Bolsonaro meanwhile say the ruling is further evidence that the Supreme Court has become too powerful and partisan. Rodrigues was arrested as part of a broader investigation into an alleged coup plot against the newly-elected President Lula da Silva. The 39-year-old hairdresser apologised for writing “You lost, idiot” on the statue of Justice outside the Supreme Federal Court - an incident dubbed the “lipstick coup”. She maintains that she did not take part in any violence. “I went to the protests and I didn’t imagine that they would be so turbulent,” said Rodrigues. “I have never done anything illegal in my life”. Rodrigues’ lawyers said that she did not enter any buildings during the riots and acted impulsively in the “heat of the moment. ” She expressed regret over her actions. ​ Justice Alexandre de Moraes, presiding over the case, argued that Rodrigues “consciously and voluntarily” aligned herself with demonstrators seeking to overthrow the government. He added that Rodrigues had admitted to taking part in anti-democratic acts in her testimony to police, and that gaps in messages on her phone suggested she had attempted to conceal evidence. The case has become a rallying point for Bolsonaro supporters, who view Rodrigues as a victim of political persecution. In February, a video about Rodrigues went viral on social media. The following month, Bolsonaro shared a post about her on X, calling for an amnesty for those involved in the civil unrest in 2023. Bolsonaro is also facing criminal proceedings over the alleged coup attempt. If found guilty he faces over 40 years in prison. "

    "title": "Latest: Will this be the 'anyone but the big parties' local election?",
    "body": "2025/04/26 - Experts revealed that “A sliver here and a sliver there” – in a few days millions of voters will be taking part in what are, frankly, a pretty weird set of elections. Forget the huge thwack of decisive national victory. Brace for what one former minister described as slivers of votes between five political parties, determining who wins and loses power over town halls in England, and one perch in the Commons. The results will set the political pace for the next few months. And from Friday, Reform could give the two big traditional tribes a problem, and also acquire a potential problem they haven’t encountered thus far - a track record to defend. The largest parties are both likely to have a horrible time of it. Labour’s wide coalition of voters went pop almost as soon as they moved into No 10. Calm heads in government say it was always going to be thus because of the state of the country when they took over. Sir Keir Starmer even told us on the record he was going to “have to be unpopular” – a curious ambition for a politician! But more candid insiders admit the government “looked very unsure” at the start. “They didn’t come in with a big project,” one source says, and many voters took a dim view of ministers’ freebies and the decision on winter fuel allowance. Labour loyalists and spin doctors will emphasise what is true – the elections being fought at council level are “us fighting in the shires”, as one of them said. A poor performance in areas that are traditionally Tory, where the party prospered in 2021, won’t be a surprise. One cabinet minister says, “they’re just not our heartlands, so we just haven’t got our normal base”. But Labour could also lose mayors and there’s no such excuse in what was one of their safest seats, in Runcorn, in the by-election where they could struggle to cling on. After 10 months in power, next week could show Labour how much the reality of government can really hurt. The Conservatives have also been falling over themselves to tell you just saying how awful it’s going to be for them after they were, in the words of one senior figure, “absolutely, mercilessly hammered” back in July. The leadership says “nowhere is safe”.  Some sources even warn in private they could lose all of the town halls they control. The concern behind the very public worry about losing hundreds and hundreds of seats is that “we might not yet actually have hit the bottom”, in the words of another veteran. Leader Kemi Badenoch’s backers continually say that rebuilding the party is a long-term project, and praise her for managing to draw at least a faint line under the toxic infighting that corroded Conservative ranks in recent years. The broad sense in Westminster is that dreadful results next week won’t usher Badenoch to the door. Still, you’d be hard pressed to find a Conservative who’d happily bet their mortgage she’ll definitely be in charge by the time of the next election. That’s in large part because in the words of one Tory bigwig, “she was working on the basis that it was her versus Starmer but it’s not her versus Starmer, it’s her versus Starmer and Farage and Davey”. This election is pick and mix, with the newest morsels on offer coming from Nigel Farage’s Reform UK. They see success in these elections as “two or three more steps up the staircase” towards power, says a senior figure. The other parties report Reform spending big, particularly on online advertising, focusing on national issues like immigration and net zero, and “putting Farage out to draw a crowd”, according to a minister. Reform sources scent success. They hope they can nab Runcorn from Labour (although they aren’t banking on it), but are more confident of winning mayoral races and of taking plenty of council seats. But anything less than big wins will undermine their exuberant claim that it’s credible to see Farage in No 10 one day – and possibly, for that matter, give pollsters red faces again. Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg’s expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you. Reform might be the loudest group, but they’re not the only one making life hard for the big boys. The Lib Dems reckon with a good night they might control more councils than the Tories this time next week – whether it’s Oxfordshire or Wiltshire, Buckinghamshire or other parts of the South West. Leader Sir Ed Davey’s been back in his happy place – carrying out ever more ridiculous stunts on the campaign trail, meeting hedgehogs, and even waving around packets of British pork chops on TikTok this time, (I’m not making that up). After July last year, the Lib Dems have a taste for making the Tories miserable, not just for the sake of it, but in the hope of taking out another chunk of their party’s traditional infrastructure, in the shape of their county councillors. And party sources suggest their activists are more motivated, and their numbers even increasing, because of US President Donald Trump. Lastly, but not least, the Greens want to continue their steady march into council seats across England. In 2023 they had their best showing in 20 years and took majority control of a council for the first time, adding many more councillors to their number last year. This time round they want to add to the tally in counties like Shropshire, Gloucestershire and Kent, where they already have bums on seats. The Green MPs have made less noise than their other newbie rivals at the other end of the spectrum, Reform. So at a time when enthusiasm for the climate agenda has been fading, or at least evolving in both the big main parties, next week the Green Party will want to show it is a growing force. Any election is also a test of our political parties’ campaign machines – the questions different for each this time round. For Labour, is it firing on all cylinders after its July triumph? Frankly, it doesn’t seem to be running a campaign at full throttle this time, which given the geography of the contests, shouldn’t surprise. For the Conservatives, how much of its once legendary campaigning muscle is left after getting whacked in the summer? Some loyalists are heartened there are still members willing to knock on doors. But a rival campaigner now calls them the “tumbleweed Tories”, claiming they’re nowhere to be seen on the ground. Both the Lib Dems and the Greens have long been playing effective local ground games, concentrating on building power bases in pockets of the country. The most acute test perhaps then is for Reform, who have proven time and time again they can make a lot of noise nationally, on air, and increasingly, online. In five-party politics, many races may be won with a relatively small share of the vote, by tiny margins, that “sliver here and sliver there”. These elections are likely to result in real-life evidence of a political idea that’s all the rage, that there’s “fragmentation” among the public, the traditional voting blocs are no more. Excitable columns are already being penned in anticipation, proclaiming that two-party politics is dead. The splitting of the vote among so many groups also seems likely to leave more councils without any a clear majority. In that case, they go into what’s known as “no overall control”, so the biggest party needs votes from the others to get their way. It’s likely that will pose the Conservatives with a tricky real-life question after many weeks of troublesome hypothetical arguments: will they, or won’t they, work with their arch rivals Reform UK on the ground? Crucially, if Reform makes its expected big advances, it will for the first time have responsibility for decisions that affect people’s lives.  That will be a big achievement. Both senior Labour and Conservative sources agree privately, as one said, “the biggest thing to come out of Thursday night is that Reform will have a record to defend”. Next week the smaller parties are on track to have plenty to celebrate.

    "title": "Breaking: Will this be the 'anyone but the big parties' local election?",
    "body": "2025/04/26 - It has been recently reported that “A sliver here and a sliver there” – in a few days millions of voters will be taking part in what are, frankly, a pretty weird set of elections. Forget the huge thwack of decisive national victory. Brace for what one former minister described as slivers of votes between five political parties, determining who wins and loses power over town halls in England, and one perch in the Commons. The results will set the political pace for the next few months. And from Friday, Reform could give the two big traditional tribes a problem, and also acquire a potential problem they haven’t encountered thus far - a track record to defend. The largest parties are both likely to have a horrible time of it. Labour’s wide coalition of voters went pop almost as soon as they moved into No 10. Calm heads in government say it was always going to be thus because of the state of the country when they took over. Sir Keir Starmer even told us on the record he was going to “have to be unpopular” – a curious ambition for a politician! But more candid insiders admit the government “looked very unsure” at the start. “They didn’t come in with a big project,” one source says, and many voters took a dim view of ministers’ freebies and the decision on winter fuel allowance. Labour loyalists and spin doctors will emphasise what is true – the elections being fought at council level are “us fighting in the shires”, as one of them said. A poor performance in areas that are traditionally Tory, where the party prospered in 2021, won’t be a surprise. One cabinet minister says, “they’re just not our heartlands, so we just haven’t got our normal base”. But Labour could also lose mayors and there’s no such excuse in what was one of their safest seats, in Runcorn, in the by-election where they could struggle to cling on. After 10 months in power, next week could show Labour how much the reality of government can really hurt. The Conservatives have also been falling over themselves to tell you just saying how awful it’s going to be for them after they were, in the words of one senior figure, “absolutely, mercilessly hammered” back in July. The leadership says “nowhere is safe”.  Some sources even warn in private they could lose all of the town halls they control. The concern behind the very public worry about losing hundreds and hundreds of seats is that “we might not yet actually have hit the bottom”, in the words of another veteran. Leader Kemi Badenoch’s backers continually say that rebuilding the party is a long-term project, and praise her for managing to draw at least a faint line under the toxic infighting that corroded Conservative ranks in recent years. The broad sense in Westminster is that dreadful results next week won’t usher Badenoch to the door. Still, you’d be hard pressed to find a Conservative who’d happily bet their mortgage she’ll definitely be in charge by the time of the next election. That’s in large part because in the words of one Tory bigwig, “she was working on the basis that it was her versus Starmer but it’s not her versus Starmer, it’s her versus Starmer and Farage and Davey”. This election is pick and mix, with the newest morsels on offer coming from Nigel Farage’s Reform UK. They see success in these elections as “two or three more steps up the staircase” towards power, says a senior figure. The other parties report Reform spending big, particularly on online advertising, focusing on national issues like immigration and net zero, and “putting Farage out to draw a crowd”, according to a minister. Reform sources scent success. They hope they can nab Runcorn from Labour (although they aren’t banking on it), but are more confident of winning mayoral races and of taking plenty of council seats. But anything less than big wins will undermine their exuberant claim that it’s credible to see Farage in No 10 one day – and possibly, for that matter, give pollsters red faces again.

Reform might be the loudest group, but they’re not the only one making life hard for the big boys. The Lib Dems reckon with a good night they might control more councils than the Tories this time next week – whether it’s Oxfordshire or Wiltshire, Buckinghamshire or other parts of the South West.

As a practising vet, writer Alf Wright needed a pen name to comply with professional rules banning advertising and chose James Herriot after seeing the goalkeeper play for Birmingham City in a televised match against Manchester United. After he starred in the 2-2 draw with the star-studded Red Devils, rival winger George Best had said: “Jim Herriot was safer than the Bank of England. ” Herriot, who was capped eight times and also played for Dunfermline Athletic, Hibernian, St Mirren, Partick Thistle, Greenock Morton, Durban City and Mansfield Town, also became famous for adopting the American Football technique of applying boot polish under and around his eyes to reduce the effects of glare from the sun.

After the Hampden defeat by Celtic, he was sold to Birmingham and it was during his six years there that he earned all his Scotland caps under manager Bobby Brown. Having fallen out of favour, he had loan spells with Mansfield Town and Aston Villa before a brief spell with Durban in South Africa. However, he returned to Scotland to join Hibs in 1971, kept a clean sheet as they famously beat Heart of Midlothian 7-0 on New Year’s Day at Tynecastle in 1973 and later that season earned a Scottish League Cup winners’ medal after a 2-1 win over Celtic. Herriot also won the Drybrough Cup on two occasions, both times against Celtic. He left for St Mirren in 1973, moved to Partick Thistle two years later, had a spell on loan to Morton before returning to Dunfermline in 1976, then joined Morton permanently for the 1976â77 season, at the end of which he retired.

    "title": "New: Virginia Giuffre remembered as 'fierce warrior against sexual abuse'",
    "body": "2025/04/26 - According to new developments, Virginia Giuffre, who became a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein and the Duke of York, has been described by her family as a “fierce warrior in the fight against sexual abuse and sex trafficking” after her death aged 41. Ms Giuffre was born Virginia Roberts in California in 1983, before her family relocated to Florida. At seven, she said she was sexually abused by a family friend and her later childhood was spent in and out of foster care. She met Ghislaine Maxwell, a British socialite, in 2000 while working as a locker room attendant at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach. Maxwell offered her an interview for the chance to train as a massage therapist, she said, and took her to Jeffrey Epstein. What she had expected to be a job interview was in fact the beginning of years of abuse, according to Ms Giuffre. Ms Giuffre was taken by Epstein on private jets around the world. She told the BBC she was abused by the US financier and “passed around like a platter of fruit” to his associates. In 2001, at the age of 17, she said Epstein brought her to London and introduced her to Prince Andrew, who she claimed sexually abused her three times. The prince, who has denied all claims against him, reached an out-of-court settlement with her in 2022 which contained no admission of liability or apology. In an interview with the Miami Herald, Ms Giuffre said Epstein had lost interest in her when she turned 19 in 2003, as she had become too old for him. She said she convinced the wealthy financier to pay for her to get training to become a professional masseuse and he arranged for her to take a class in Thailand. But she was also expected to bring home a Thai girl that Epstein had arranged to come to the US. Instead, on that trip, Ms Giuffre met a man named Robert whom she fell in love with and married 10 days later. They spent time in the US before moving to Australia, initially settling in Cairns in far north Queensland before relocating close to the western city of Perth. The pair had three children together: Christian, Noah and Emily. Reports suggest their marriage eventually broke down. On 2 February, she allegedly breached a family violence restraining order in Ocean Reef, the town where her family lived, according to Western Australia Courts. On 22 March she posted the following on Instagram: “My beautiful babies have no clue how much I love them and they’re being poisoned with lies. “I miss them so very much. I have been through hell &amp; back in my 41 years but this is incredibly hurting me worse than anything else. ” Just over a week later she posted again to say she was recovering in hospital after a “serious” vehicle collision and had “four days to live”, alongside a photo of her in hospital. Her family later said she had not intended to make the post public. Western Australia Police disputed the severity of the crash, saying they were only able to find a report of a “minor crash” between a school bus and a car in Neergabby, about an hour north of Perth, on 24 March. The collision was reported by the bus driver the following day, while there were no reported injuries, a police spokeswoman said. Ms Giuffre was living at a farm in Neergabby, where she was found dead on Friday. “It is with utterly broken hearts that we announce that Virginia passed away last night at her farm in Western Australia,” her family said in a statement, confirming her death by suicide. “Virginia was a fierce warrior in the fight against sexual abuse and sex trafficking. She was the light that lifted so many survivors. Despite all the adversity she faced in her life, she shone so bright. She will be missed beyond measure. ” The family added the children “were the light of her life” and that it was while holding her newborn daughter she “realized she had to fight back against those who had abused her and so many others. ” Ms Giuffre’s representative Dini von Mueffling described her as “one of the most extraordinary human beings I have ever had the honour to know. “Deeply loving, wise, and funny, she was a beacon to other survivors and victims. She adored her children and many animals. It was the privilege of a lifetime to represent her. ” If you are suffering distress or despair, details of help and support in the UK are available at BBC Action Line.

Ms Giuffre was born Virginia Roberts in California in 1983, before her family relocated to Florida. At seven, she said she was sexually abused by a family friend and her later childhood was spent in and out of foster care. She met Ghislaine Maxwell, a British socialite, in 2000 while working as a locker room attendant at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach. Maxwell offered her an interview for the chance to train as a massage therapist, she said, and took her to Jeffrey Epstein. What she had expected to be a job interview was in fact the beginning of years of abuse, according to Ms Giuffre. Ms Giuffre was taken by Epstein on private jets around the world. She told the BBC she was abused by the US financier and “passed around like a platter of fruit” to his associates. In 2001, at the age of 17, she said Epstein brought her to London and introduced her to Prince Andrew, who she claimed sexually abused her three times. The prince, who has denied all claims against him, reached an out-of-court settlement with her in 2022 which contained no admission of liability or apology. In an interview with the Miami Herald, Ms Giuffre said Epstein had lost interest in her when she turned 19 in 2003, as she had become too old for him. She said she convinced the wealthy financier to pay for her to get training to become a professional masseuse and he arranged for her to take a class in Thailand. But she was also expected to bring home a Thai girl that Epstein had arranged to come to the US. Instead, on that trip, Ms Giuffre met a man named Robert whom she fell in love with and married 10 days later. They spent time in the US before moving to Australia, initially settling in Cairns in far north Queensland before relocating close to the western city of Perth. The pair had three children together: Christian, Noah and Emily. Reports suggest their marriage eventually broke down. On 2 February, she allegedly breached a family violence restraining order in Ocean Reef, the town where her family lived, according to Western Australia Courts. On 22 March she posted the following on Instagram: “My beautiful babies have no clue how much I love them and they’re being poisoned with lies. “I miss them so very much. I have been through hell &amp; back in my 41 years but this is incredibly hurting me worse than anything else. ” Just over a week later she posted again to say she was recovering in hospital after a “serious” vehicle collision and had “four days to live”, alongside a photo of her in hospital. Her family later said she had not intended to make the post public. Western Australia Police disputed the severity of the crash, saying they were only able to find a report of a “minor crash” between a school bus and a car in Neergabby, about an hour north of Perth, on 24 March. The collision was reported by the bus driver the following day, while there were no reported injuries, a police spokeswoman said. Ms Giuffre was living at a farm in Neergabby, where she was found dead on Friday. “It is with utterly broken hearts that we announce that Virginia passed away last night at her farm in Western Australia,” her family said in a statement, confirming her death by suicide. “Virginia was a fierce warrior in the fight against sexual abuse and sex trafficking. She was the light that lifted so many survivors. Despite all the adversity she faced in her life, she shone so bright. She will be missed beyond measure. ” The family added the children “were the light of her life” and that it was while holding her newborn daughter she “realized she had to fight back against those who had abused her and so many others. ” Ms Giuffre’s representative Dini von Mueffling described her as “one of the most extraordinary human beings I have ever had the honour to know. “Deeply loving, wise, and funny, she was a beacon to other survivors and victims. She adored her children and many animals. It was the privilege of a lifetime to represent her. ” If you are suffering distress or despair, details of help and support in the UK are available at BBC Action Line.

    "body": "2025/04/26 - According to new developments, Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry had moved into second spot after 12 holes but lost ground after suffering three late bogeys Zurich Classic - second-round leaderboard -17 I Salinda &amp; K Velo (US); -16 B Griffin &amp; A Novak (US); -15 R Hojgaard &amp; N Hojgaard (Den); -14 J Bridgeman &amp; C Phillips (US) Selected: -13 D Skinns &amp; B Taylor (Eng); -12 A Rai &amp; S Theegala (Eng/US); -11 R McIlroy &amp; S Lowry (NI/Ire), R MacIntyre &amp; T Detry (Sco/Bel) Missed cut: -9 M Fitzpatrick &amp; A Fitzpatrick (Eng); -8 C Morikawa &amp; K Kitayama (US), M Wallace &amp; T Olesen (Eng/Den); -5 L Donald &amp; C Villegas (Eng/Col) Full leaderboard Defending champions Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry remained six off the pace at the halfway stage of the Zurich Classic after dropping three late shots in New Orleans. The Irish duo, aiming to become the first players to successfully defend the title, started the day six adrift following their eight-under-par fourball round of 64 on Thursday. They looked set to be closer to the leaders after playing their opening 12 holes on Friday in six under par under the foursomes format but their late stumbles included bogeys at their final two holes as they signed for a 69. US rookies Kevin Velo and Isaiah Salinda retained their lead after also carding a 69. “We were six under through 12 and cruising and then a bit of a bad finish but I didn’t feel like we played that badly to have the finish that we did,” said McIlroy, competing in his first event since completing the career Grand Slam by winning the Masters two weeks ago. “A couple of loose shots here and there. ” McIlroy holed an 11-foot eagle putt at the second and four further birdies left the Irish duo in a share of second place on 14 under after 12 holes. However, McIlroy missed the green with his approach on 13 as they dropped a stroke and further shots went at the last two holes when they were unable to find the greens in regulation. Saturday’s round will revert to the fourball format before Sunday’s foursomes finale. “Tomorrow it will be hard to stay patient because the fourball format you just have to try to make as many birdies as you can,” added the Masters champion. Velo and Salinda lead their fellow US players Ben Griffin and Andrew Novak by one shot, with Danish twins Rasmus and Nicolai Hojgaard a further stroke off the pace. English pair David Skinns and Ben Taylor share fifth spot four off the pace after firing a 67 on Friday with their compatriot Aaron Rai and US player Sahith Theegala one shot further back. Scotland’s Robert MacIntyre and his Belgian partner Thomas Detry share 16th place in the group that includes McIlroy and Lowry after firing a 69 on Friday. The fourball element sees both players hitting their own ball with the best score counting, while players take alternate shots with one ball in the foursomes. "

    "body": "2025/04/26 - Here’s what you need to know: Marks &amp; Spencer (M&amp;S) says it has stopped taking online orders as the company struggles to recover from a cyber attack. Customers began reporting problems last weekend, and on Tuesday the retailer confirmed it was facing a “cyber incident”. Now, M&amp;S has entirely paused orders on its website and apps - including for food deliveries and clothes - and says it will refund orders placed by customers on Friday. The firm’s shares fell by 5% following the announcement, before recovering. Online orders remained paused on Saturday morning. “We are truly sorry for this inconvenience,” the retailer wrote in a post on X. “Our experienced team - supported by leading cyber experts - is working extremely hard to restart online and app shopping. “We are incredibly grateful to our customers, colleagues and partners for their understanding and support. ” It said its stores remain open despite the issues affecting online ordering. Previously, the firm was dealing with problems which affected people using contactless payments, Click &amp; Collect, as well as those paying with gift cards. Since it suspended online ordering, M&amp;S has responded to social media posts advising customers that these problems persist. “Gift cards, e-gift cards and credit receipts can’t currently be used as a payment method in store or online,” it said in response to one person on X. But it told another that if people have already received an email telling them an item is ready to be collected, they should be able to go into the store and pick it up. “We’re holding all parcels in store until further notice, so there’s no risk of it being sent back,” it said. But some people have criticised the firm for its handling of the outage, particularly around its messaging to customers. “After being told yesterday in the evening the problem with gift cards was sorted, went in store today and was sent away again,” one person told the firm in a post on X. They said it was the fourth day in a row they had tried and failed to use their M&amp;S gift card. Meanwhile, despite the frustrations, some people online have praised in-store staff over their service amid the problems, and called for customers not to take their frustrations out on workers. But many still appear to have questions over how existing purchases, orders and returns will be impacted by the continued fallout from the cyber attack. Online grocer Ocado, which sells M&amp;S food on its platform, is unaffected by the problems as it runs on an entirely separate system. A spokesperson from the Information Commissioner’s Office told the BBC that M&amp;S was “assessing the information provided” after the retailer told it about the incident. The firm previously said on Tuesday it had reported the incident to the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), and the National Crime Agency told the BBC it was working with the NCSC to support the firm. In an update to investors on Friday, M&amp;S said its decision to pause online orders in the UK formed part of its “proactive management” of the incident. “The M&amp;S team - supported by leading experts - is working extremely hard to restore online operations and continue to serve customers well,” it said. Amid the continuing fallout of this week’s cyber attack, however, experts are speculating around what may be behind it. Nathaniel Jones, vice-president of security and AI strategy at cyber security firm Darktrace, said M&amp;S halting online sales shows “the cascading impact these attacks can have on revenue streams”. “It demonstrates how quickly cyber incidents can cripple retail operations across both digital and physical channels,” he added. William Wright, from cybersecurity firm Closed Door Security, said he believed it could have a “material impact” on the firm. “Data shows almost a quarter of the store’s sales happen online, so no matter how long this pause is put in place, it will hurt M&amp;S financially,” he said. The retailer is the latest major brand to experience significant disruption to its online services in recent months. Morrisons faced huge problems with its Christmas orders last year, with deliveries cancelled and discounts not applied. This was followed by two major banking outages on what was pay day for many in the first two months of this year. In January, serious IT problems at Barclays affected the bank’s app and online banking. It was later disclosed Barclays could face compensation payments of £12. 5m. In February, several banks - notably Lloyds - faced outages, leaving businesses unable to pay staff. Additional reporting by Liv McMahon "

    "title": "Update: Will 'greatest' London Marathon line-ups break records?",
    "body": "2025/04/26 - Let’s dive into the details: Sifan Hassan edged Tigst Assefa to Olympic marathon gold at Paris 2024 Will records be broken? That is the big question before this year’s London Marathon on Sunday. Race director Hugh Brasher declared the event’s 45th edition had “the greatest elite fields in the history of the London Marathon” after a stellar line-up was announced in January. Despite the late withdrawal of women’s world record holder Ruth Chepngetich and 2024 champion Peres Jepchirchir, the women’s race still features the second and third fastest athletes of all time. That includes Sifan Hassan, one of four reigning Olympic and Paralympic marathon champions contesting this year’s event, who returns for the first time since her remarkable comeback victory on her debut in 2023. Two of the five fastest men in history line up in the men’s race, led by record four-time champion Eliud Kipchoge, while half marathon world record holder Jacob Kiplimo will make his eagerly anticipated debut over 26. 2 miles. Meanwhile, the elite wheelchair events feature Swiss athletes Marcel Hug and Catherine Debrunner - the world and course record holders. So who will win - and will they secure a piece of history and a lucrative bonus? A course record in the men’s (two hours one minute 25 seconds) or women’s (2:16:16) elite fields is worth an additional $25,000 (Â£19,000), while anyone breaking a world record (2:00:35 men, 2:16:16 women) will receive $125,000 (Â£94,000). London Marathon Sunday, 27 April from 08:30 BST Watch on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app In an elite men’s race featuring 10 competitors to have run a marathon in under two hours and five minutes, could it be a debutant who steals the limelight? Uganda’s Kiplimo, 24, became the first person to run a half marathon in under 57 minutes in February, clocking 56:42 to shatter the previous mark by 48 seconds in Barcelona. That performance has convinced many that he could become the first person to break the two-hour barrier in a competitive marathon, after Kipchoge proved that was possible in controlled conditions in 2019. “I think it is going to be the most fascinating debut ever,” said Brasher. “Do I think he could be the athlete that runs under two hours? Yes. But let’s see what happens on Sunday. ” Speaking to BBC Sport, Kiplimo said: “I have seen a lot of people saying I will be the one to run under two hours. On Sunday, it is about how my body will feel. “I will do my best. I can’t say now, I have not yet felt the feelings for a marathon. Maybe, [I will know] when I am done with London on Sunday. ” ‘Once a fool to become an expert’ - Yee set for marathon debut Hall ‘starting from scratch’ as London awaits London Marathon 2025 - everything you need to know Kiplimo will be joined by distance-running great and two-time Olympic champion Kipchoge, whose official personal best stands at 2:01:09. The Kenyan, who last raced in London when he earned his fourth victory in 2019, told BBC Sport he can “absolutely” win again - and believes a sub-two hour marathon “will not be far [away]”. “The only thing is for people to accept to try, dare to try and dare to entertain. I have shown them the way to make history. I think in the near future we will look at someone who is running under two hours,” Kipchoge said. The 40-year-old added he still had “some races to run” before the end of his career, saying: “I am still hungry to inspire someone somewhere. I am really motivated to train every day, to showcase and tell people to make this world a running world. ” Reigning champion Alexander Mutiso Munyao, 28, said he was “happy running with the strongest field ever” as he prepared to defend his title, with Olympic champion Tamirat Tola and Sabastian Sawe - the fifth fastest man of all time - also present. The late Kelvin Kiptum’s 2023 men’s course record is 2:01:25, while the Kenyan’s world record stands at 2:00:35. Despite the absences of Chepngetich and Jepchirchir, the sight of former world record holder Tigst Assefa and Hassan on the start line means hopes of a new women’s record are far from over. The elite women race separately in London, meaning the time to beat is Jepchirchir’s 2024 London winning time of 2:16:16, which also stands as the women’s-only world record. Both Assefa and Hassan have run faster than that. Ethiopia’s Assefa smashed the mixed world record in 2023 by running 2:11:53 in Berlin and has suggested similar could be possible this year. “I did a half marathon in December and that was a test,” she said. “My preparation for this race is good and I feel like I’m in better shape than I was in Berlin. ” Sifan Hassan became the first woman to win Olympic 5000m, 10,000m and marathon medals at a single Games in Paris Meanwhile, it is never dull when Hassan is involved. The 32-year-old Dutchwoman won on her debut in London two years ago despite stopping at the roadside mid-race to stretch out a hip injury while her rivals ran away from her - and still clocked 2:18:33. Hassan won Olympic gold last summer in similarly dramatic fashion, appearing to fade from contention before battling past Assefa in a spectacular sprint finish to add to her bronze medals in the 5,000m and 10,000m on the track. Her personal best of 2:13:44 - set at the 2023 Chicago Marathon - puts her third on the all-time list of fastest female marathoners and she spoke about wanting to break the 2:10 barrier earlier this year, something only Chepngetich has achieved. Speaking on Friday, she said: “In the marathon, whether you like it or not you will push.  Running the marathon teaches you to push. “I will do my best. I am getting nervous - that is good. When I get nervous I do well. ” ‘Rob will be with me throughout London Marathon’ ‘Mum’s record in mind’ - McColgan ready for marathon debut BBC Sport extends London Marathon deal to 2030 In Emile Cairess’ injury-enforced absence, Mahamed Mahamed and Philip Sesemann - respectively the third and fifth-fastest British marathon runners of all-time - will hope to shine. The 27-year-old Mahamed, fourth behind Cairess last year, told BBC Sport: “As an athlete you always want to push to the next level. If a medal comes, it comes. On the day anything can happen. ” There will be plenty of attention on Olympic and world triathlon champion Alex Yee as he makes his debut, while Jonny Mellor, Dewi Griffiths and Weynay Ghebresilasie have all run under 2:10. Eilish McColgan finished 15th in the Olympic women’s 10,000m at Paris 2024 Eilish McColgan makes her marathon debut after injury forced her to withdraw in 2023. The Scot, 34, has mother Liz’s personal best of 2:26:52 as a target, while Steph Twell’s Scottish record is a fraction quicker at 2:26:40. “I would love to break my mum’s PB; the Scottish record is a touch quicker - they would be loose goals,” McColgan told BBC Sport. “I would love to be the top Brit home and be relatively competitive in what is one of the strongest women’s fields in the history of marathon running. ” She is joined on the elite start line by Charlotte Purdue, Rose Harvey and Phily Bowden, who have all previously run under 2:26. Eight-time champion David Weir is one of six Britons in the elite wheelchair men’s field, while Eden Rainbow-Cooper, who finished fourth in Monday’s Boston Marathon, is joined by multiple Paralympic medallist and London debutant Sammi Kinghorn and Jade Jones-Hall in the women’s wheelchair race.

    "body": "2025/04/26 - Here’s what you need to know: Sifan Hassan edged Tigst Assefa to Olympic marathon gold at Paris 2024 Will records be broken? That is the big question before this year’s London Marathon on Sunday. Race director Hugh Brasher declared the event’s 45th edition had “the greatest elite fields in the history of the London Marathon” after a stellar line-up was announced in January. Despite the late withdrawal of women’s world record holder Ruth Chepngetich and 2024 champion Peres Jepchirchir, the women’s race still features the second and third fastest athletes of all time. That includes Sifan Hassan, one of four reigning Olympic and Paralympic marathon champions contesting this year’s event, who returns for the first time since her remarkable comeback victory on her debut in 2023. Two of the five fastest men in history line up in the men’s race, led by record four-time champion Eliud Kipchoge, while half marathon world record holder Jacob Kiplimo will make his eagerly anticipated debut over 26. 2 miles. Meanwhile, the elite wheelchair events feature Swiss athletes Marcel Hug and Catherine Debrunner - the world and course record holders. So who will win - and will they secure a piece of history and a lucrative bonus? A course record in the men’s (two hours one minute 25 seconds) or women’s (2:16:16) elite fields is worth an additional $25,000 (Â£19,000), while anyone breaking a world record (2:00:35 men, 2:16:16 women) will receive $125,000 (Â£94,000). London Marathon Sunday, 27 April from 08:30 BST Watch on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app In an elite men’s race featuring 10 competitors to have run a marathon in under two hours and five minutes, could it be a debutant who steals the limelight? Uganda’s Kiplimo, 24, became the first person to run a half marathon in under 57 minutes in February, clocking 56:42 to shatter the previous mark by 48 seconds in Barcelona. That performance has convinced many that he could become the first person to break the two-hour barrier in a competitive marathon, after Kipchoge proved that was possible in controlled conditions in 2019. “I think it is going to be the most fascinating debut ever,” said Brasher. “Do I think he could be the athlete that runs under two hours? Yes. But let’s see what happens on Sunday. ” Speaking to BBC Sport, Kiplimo said: “I have seen a lot of people saying I will be the one to run under two hours. On Sunday, it is about how my body will feel. “I will do my best. I can’t say now, I have not yet felt the feelings for a marathon. Maybe, [I will know] when I am done with London on Sunday. ” ‘Once a fool to become an expert’ - Yee set for marathon debut Hall ‘starting from scratch’ as London awaits London Marathon 2025 - everything you need to know Kiplimo will be joined by distance-running great and two-time Olympic champion Kipchoge, whose official personal best stands at 2:01:09. The Kenyan, who last raced in London when he earned his fourth victory in 2019, told BBC Sport he can “absolutely” win again - and believes a sub-two hour marathon “will not be far [away]”. “The only thing is for people to accept to try, dare to try and dare to entertain. I have shown them the way to make history. I think in the near future we will look at someone who is running under two hours,” Kipchoge said.

Liu, 27, found the hole from 170 yards at the par-five eighth with her second shot, using a seven iron. It proved vital as she also made three bogeys on the front nine before finishing with a bogey and a birdie to card a level-par 72 and lead a group of four players by one shot. England’s Georgia Hall remains in contention at the first women’s major of the season after hitting 72 to stay four strokes off the lead in Texas. Defending champion Nelly Korda rallied from a first-round 77 to card a four-under 68 and is at one over at The Club at Carlton Woods. Americans Lindy Duncan and Sarah Schmelzel, Japan’s Mao Saigo and South Korea’s Hyo Joo Kim are a shot behind Liu. South Korea’s Haeran Ryu, who shared the overnight lead with Liu, made a 74 to slip back to joint-sixth on five under for the tournament. China’s Weiwei Zhang was also on five under after 15 holes of her second round when play was suspended because of bad light. American Lexi Thompson, who has retired from full-time golf but continues to play selected events, is in contention at four under. Liu, who is chasing a first major and first LPGA Tour win, said she would feel the pressure this weekend. “Definitely I will feel a little bit, because this this is a major,” she said. “I know the course going to be harder, so I think should just stay patient, calm, because I’m a very emotional person. ” Hall had an eventful round featuring three bogeys, one double bogey and four birdies to ultimately stay in striking distance of the lead. However, compatriots Lottie Woad and Charley Hull slipped back to four over, with Scotland’s Gemma Dryburgh a shot ahead. All three will miss the cut, which is projected to be at two over, with nine players yet to finish their second round. Korda’s 68, which included six birdies and two bogeys, has therefore moved her inside the cut line and gives the world number one an outside chance of mounting a remarkable comeback over the weekend. Three-time major winner Lydia Ko is also at one over. "

    "title": "Big News: 'We have more in common with America than the rest of Canada'",
    "body": "2025/04/26 - Here’s what you need to know: The threat to Canada’s sovereignty from US President Donald Trump has dominated the election, but the country also faces a challenge from within. Some western Canadians, fed up with a decade of Liberal rule, are openly calling for separation. Standing in front of a crowd of about 100 squeezed into a small event hall in the city of Lethbridge, Dennis Modry is asking locals about Alberta’s future. Who thinks Alberta should have a bigger role in Canada, he asks? A dozen or so raise their hands. Who thinks the province should push for a split from Canada and form its own nation? About half the crowd raise their hands. “How many people would like Alberta to join the US?” Another show of support from half the crowd. Mr Modry, a retired heart surgeon, is a co-leader of the Alberta Prosperity Project, a grassroots organisation pushing for an independence referendum. The possibility of a split has long been a talking point in this conservative-leaning province. But two factors have given it new momentum: Trump’s comments about making Canada the 51st US state, and the subsequent boost that has given the Liberal Party in the polls ahead of Monday’s federal election. Mr Modry told the BBC the separatist movement has grown in recent months - driven in part, he believes, by the president’s rhetoric. “We’re not interested in that”, he said. “We’re interested in Alberta sovereignty. ” Jeffrey Rath, however - a lawyer and rancher from Calgary who is another of the project’s co-founders - was not as dismissive of Trump’s 51st state suggestion. Although he agrees independence is the priority, he could see a future where Alberta joined with the US. “We have a lot more culturally in common with our neighbours to the south in Montana… [and] with our cousins in Texas, than we do anywhere else,” he said. Previously on the political fringes, the possibility of a unity crisis is now being discussed out in the open. In an opinion piece for national newspaper the Globe and Mail, Preston Manning - an Albertan considered one of the founders of the modern conservative movement in Canada - warned “large numbers of Westerners simply will not stand for another four years of Liberal government, no matter who leads it”. Accusing the party of mismanaging national affairs and ignoring the priorities of western Canadians, he added: “A vote for the Carney Liberals is a vote for Western secession – a vote for the breakup of Canada as we know it. ” This sense of “western alienation”, a term used to describe the feeling that the region is often overlooked by politicians in Canada’s capital, is nothing new. For decades, many in the oil and gas-rich prairie provinces of Alberta and Saskachtewan have bemoaned how they are underrepresented, despite the region’s economic significance for the country as a whole. That resentment grew under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government, which brought in environmental policies some Albertans view as a direct attack on the region’s economic growth. National polls suggest the Liberals, now under the leadership of Mark Carney, could be headed for their fourth consecutive win come election day on Monday. That it could come in part because of a surge of support in Ontario and Quebec - the eastern provinces where so much of the population is concentrated - only adds to the regional divide. Judy Schneider, whose husband works in the oil industry in Calgary, told the BBC she would vote “yes” in an independence referendum. She said she didn’t see Carney, who spent much of the last decade away from Canada but was raised in Edmonton, Alberta’s capital, as a westerner. “He can come and say ‘I’m from Alberta,’ but is he?” Ms Schneider said. An independent Alberta remains an unlikely prospect - a recent Angus Reid poll suggested that only one in four Albertans would vote to leave Canada if a referendum were held now. A majority of Canadians, however, feel the issue should be taken seriously, a separate Nanos poll indicated. Political analysts say the divide will pose a challenge to the country’s next prime minister, especially if Carney wins. And even a victory for Calgary-born Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre would “not solve the imbalance that presently exists between the East and the West,” Mr Modry, the activist, said. That wider sentiment has pushed Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, who leads the United Conservative Party, to strike her own path in trade talks with the US, while other provincial leaders and the federal government have co-ordinated their efforts closely. She even visited Trump at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida. In Canada, Smith has publicly warned of a “national unity crisis” if Alberta’s demands - which centre around repealing Trudeau-era environmental laws to accelerate oil and gas production - are not met by the new prime minister within six months of the election. While Smith has dismissed talk of outright separation as “nonsense”, critics have accused her of stoking the flames at such a consequential time for Canada’s future. Even those within the separatist movement have different ideas on how best to achieve their goals. Lorna Guitton, a born-and-bred Albertan and a volunteer with the Alberta Prosperity Project, told the BBC in Lethbridge that her aim was for the province to have a better relationship with the rest of Canada. She described the current union as “broken”, and believes a referendum, or the threat of it, will give Albertans “leverage” in future negotiations with Ottawa. But Ms Guitton also dismissed any notion of it becoming a 51st US state. “They’ve got enough of their own problems. Why would I want to be part of that?” she said. “I would rather be my own independent, sovereign province, or a province with a better deal in Canada. ” At his ranch outside of Calgary in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, Mr Rath has a different view. As he tended to his race horses, he spoke of the political and social attitudes of free enterprise and small government that are shared by Albertans and many Americans. “From that perspective, I would see Alberta as being a good fit within the United States,” he said. He is currently putting together a “fact-finding” delegation to travel to Washington DC and bring the movement directly to the Trump administration. Many voters in Alberta, however, dismiss the notion of independence altogether, even if they agree that the province has been overlooked. Steve Lachlan from Lethbridge agrees the West lacks representation in Ottawa but said: “We already have separation, and we need to come together. ” And the Liberals are not entirely shut out from the province. Polls suggest that Alberta may send more Liberal MPs to Ottawa than in 2021, partly due to changing demographics that led to the creation of new ridings in urban Edmonton and Calgary. James Forrester, who lives in the battleground Calgary Centre district, told the BBC he had traditionally voted Conservative but has leaned left in recent years. This time, he will vote Liberal because of the “Carney factor”. “I feel he’s the best guy to deal with Trump,” he said. As for the separation sentiment: “I’m not worried about it. ” Additional reporting and videos by Eloise Alanna "

    "title": "Update: How much has Elon Musk's Doge cut from US government spending?",
    "body": "2025/04/25 - It has been recently reported that Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) - set up to cut US government spending - claims to have saved, on average, more than $10bn a week since President Trump entered office. “We’re talking about almost $200bn and rising fast,” Trump told the BBC when talking about Mr Musk’s cost-cutting drive on 23 April. Doge’s website says it is focusing on cancelling contracts, grants and leases put in place by previous administrations, as well as tackling fraud and reducing the government workforce. BBC Verify has looked at the agency’s biggest claimed savings, examining the figures and speaking to experts. Our analysis found that behind some of the large numbers, there is a lack of evidence to back them up. In October, Mr Musk pledged to cut “at least $2 trillion” from the federal government budget. He subsequently halved this target and on 10 April talked about making savings of $150bn from “cutting fraud and waste” by the end of the next financial year in 2026. The US federal budget for the last financial year was $6. 75tn. Doge publishes a running total of its estimated savings on its website - which stood at $160bn the last time the site was updated on 20 April. However, less than 40% of this figure is broken down into individual savings. We downloaded the data from the Doge website on 23 April and added up the total claimed savings from contracts, grants and leases. Our analysis found only about half of these itemised savings had a link to a document or other form of evidence. US media has also highlighted some accounting errors, including Doge mistakenly claiming to have saved $8bn from cancelling an immigration contract which in fact had a total value of $8m. Doge says it is working to upload all receipts in a “digestible and transparent manner” and that, as of 20 April, it has posted receipts “representing around 30% of all total savings”. It also lists some receipts as being “unavailable for legal reasons”. BBC Verify examined the four largest savings listed on the Doge website which had receipts attached. The department claims these add up to $8. 3bn, but after examining the evidence provided and speaking to people familiar with federal contracts, this figure appears to be overstated. For three of the savings, Doge links to documents on the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS). This is a database which records contracts given out by the US government. The documents show a contract’s start and end date, the maximum amount the government has agreed to spend, and how much of that has been spent. David Drabkin, a federal contracts expert who helped develop the FPDS database, said the maximum figure listed should be treated with caution. “FPDS does not reflect the actual paid price until some period of time after the contract has been completed and the contract actions have been recorded,” he says. “For example, when buying research and development into a vaccine no one really knows how much that’s going to cost - so when a price is set, it’s not a definite price but rather an upper limit. ” So if Doge counts the maximum figure, that can represent projected spending over a number of years, rather than a direct saving from the country’s yearly spending. Doge’s largest listed individual saving is $2. 9bn. It comes from cancelling a contract - which started in 2023 under President Biden - for a facility in Texas to house up to 3,000 unaccompanied migrant children. Doge appears to have taken the “total contract value” until 2028 - the end date listed - and subtracted the amount spent so far to get the $2. 9bn figure. But the contract was reviewed annually, meaning renewing it until 2028 was not guaranteed. A source familiar with this contract - who spoke on condition of anonymity - told BBC Verify that Doge’s figure is “based on speculative, never-used figures” and that the actual spending depended on how many children were placed at the facility and the services they required. “In truth, the government never incurred those costs and could never reach that ceiling amount. The real, documentable savings from early termination were approximately $153 million”, they estimated. They say this figure comes from tallying up the $18m per month fixed running costs (for things like staffing and security at the facility) from February - when Doge announced the cut - to November - when the contract was subject to annual review. They also told us that the site - which closed on the same day as the Doge announcement - never reached its maximum capacity of 3,000 children, and about 2,000 stayed at the Texas facility at its peak, before numbers fell significantly as border crossings decreased. We contacted the Administration for Children and Families and the Department for Health and Human Services which awarded the contract but are yet to hear back. The second largest saving listed by Doge comes from cancelling a contract between the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and an IT company called Centennial Technologies which it claims was worth $1. 9bn. The document which Doge links to has a total contract value of $1. 9bn and all of the other cost fields, including the amount already spent, are for $0. However, Mr Drabkin told us this does not necessarily mean that nothing had been spent on the contract. He said several government departments have poor recording keeping, meaning the amount spent during some contracts might not always be updated in a timely fashion. The contract start date is listed as August 2024 and was estimated to run until 2031. However, Centennial Technologies’ CEO told the New York Times that the agreement had actually been cancelled last autumn during the Biden administration. The company did not respond to our requests for further comment. Another IT contract, this time with the Department of Defense, is the third largest claimed saving. Doge says $1. 76bn was saved by cancelling a contract with an IT services company called A1FEDIMPACT. On the contract document, the total value is listed as $2. 4bn. An online database of government contracts called Higher Gov says this amount was the ceiling value. Again, there is $0 recorded for the amount that had been spent at the time the contract was terminated. It is unclear where Doge’s figure of $1. 76bn comes from - we have asked the Pentagon and the supplier about it. The fourth largest claimed saving of $1. 75bn comes from cancelling a USAID grant to Gavi, a global health organisation, which campaigns to improve access to vaccines. Doge links to a page on USASpending. gov. It shows a grant was paid to Gavi in three instalments, during the Biden administration, totalling $880m. Gavi confirmed that $880m had been paid out by USAID but said it had not been told the grant had been terminated. “Gavi has not received a termination notice related to this grant,” a spokesperson told us. We have not found any evidence for the $1. 75bn saving claimed by Doge, and a source familiar with the contract said it was unclear where it comes from. We asked the USAID Office of Inspector General about the grant but it did not respond to us. While Doge may have cut a significant amount of government spending, the lack of evidence provided for its biggest claimed savings makes it impossible to independently confirm exactly how much. Doge does not have a press office but BBC Verify has contacted the White House to ask for more evidence of these claimed savings. Additional reporting by Ned Davies and Alison Benjamin. What do you want BBC Verify to investigate? "

    "title": "Update: Border officers saw a couple behaving oddly with a baby - and uncovered a mystery",
    "body": "2025/04/25 - Let’s dive into the details: As they walked through arrivals at Manchester Airport, a couple seemed to be behaving oddly towards their baby. Something did not sit right with Border Force officers. One worried the relationship between the three was “not genuine”. Officers pulled the couple for questioning. The man, Raphael Ossai, claimed to be the girl’s father. He handed them a birth certificate for the baby, which showed his travelling companion, Oluwakemi Olasanoye, as the child’s mother. But officers found a second birth certificate, hidden in the lining of the couple’s luggage. It named another woman, Raphael’s British wife, as the little girl’s mother. It was the start of a mystery that remains unsolved - the little girl’s true identity is still not fully known. What we do know is the child is not related to any of the adults. The girl, who we are calling Lucy, seems to have been born in rural Nigeria in September 2022, and given to an orphanage when she was just three days old. The couple who carried her to the UK, Ossai and Olasanoye, pleaded guilty to immigration offences and were sentenced to 18 months in prison followed by deportation. Now Lucy has been in care in Manchester for nearly two years. The Nigerian High Commission did not engage in depth with the case despite multiple requests from the High Court. For the last nine months the High Court in Manchester has been trying to find out who Lucy really is, as it decides what her future should be. The court heard that on 20 June 2023, Ossai and Olasanoye unlawfully brought Lucy to the UK from Lagos, via Addis Ababa. Olasanoye had a visa to work in the UK and agreed to travel with Ossai and Lucy. When the couple were sentenced in criminal court, it was believed that Lucy was the child of Ossai and his Nigerian-born British wife. Ossai met his British wife in Kenya and married her in Nigeria in 2017 – but he had never been to the UK. When he applied for a visitor’s visa, he was turned down due to financial circumstances. At the time of sentencing, the judge said the “principal motive for this offence” was to bring the baby to the UK so he and his British wife could live as a “family” with Lucy. However during the High Court hearing, DNA tests proved Lucy is not related to either of the adults. Documents presented to the court said that she had been born to a young student in rural Nigeria, who was not able to care for her. Her father was not known. The papers indicated the mother had voluntarily relinquished Lucy to an orphanage. Ossai and his British wife said they had been looking for a little girl to adopt, and he collected Lucy when she was a tiny baby. The couple had permission to foster the little girl but not to adopt her or take her out of Nigeria. Ossai, a music producer, took Lucy to a small flat in Lagos where he looked after her for the next nine months. He told the court he had cared for the baby well – that he had fed her properly, played her music, and kept her safe. But a social worker from the Children and Family Court Advisory Service CAFCASS said she believed Lucy had been neglected, underfed and under stimulated. She had met the little girl when she was just over a year old, in October 2023. “It was really sad when I met her,” a social worker told the court. Giving evidence, she said it was as though the child did not realise “she was actually a person”. “She was so lost, and not really present… she just felt so alone yet she was surrounded by people,” she added. During an observation session, the social worker said Lucy became very “panicky” when her foster carer stood up to leave the room. She also displayed an “extreme cry” that was “very difficult to soothe”. When asked whether Lucy could have been traumatised by the flight or by her transfer to care, the social worker said she believes it is unlikely that alone was to blame. She added that if Lucy had developed a secure attachment to Ossai, that would have been transferred to her foster carer. The judge said the child lacked “basic parental attachment” but did not make a finding on the cause. “I am sure that her being brought into this country illegally and thus separated from her carers is bound to be a significant factor,” he said. Although Ossai has been sentenced to be deported, he and his British wife asked the High Court to assess them to care for Lucy. Ossai said that he thought of Lucy as his daughter. His lawyers said that as the Nigerian authorities had approved him as her foster parent, the English court had no power to take her away. Lucy had always been happy with him, Ossai said, and he thought taking her into care had upset her, especially placing her with white foster carers. “The white may be strange to her,” he added. “When they took her from me I saw the way she was looking at them. ” His lawyers raised concerns that if Lucy were adopted by a white family, she would lose her cultural identity. Ossai’s British wife said Lucy “is like that precious gift that I desired so much”. She told the High Court she would do “anything and everything” for her, adding “I see her as my child”. Both broke down and cried in court when they talked about the little girl. The High Court Judge hearing the case, Sir Jonathan Cohen, rejected Ossai and his British wife’s application to be assessed to care for Lucy. He said the lies they had told and the actions they had taken, especially moving Lucy from Nigeria, had “inevitably caused her very significant emotional harm”. Lucy has been placed with several different foster carers and is residing in at least her third new home since her arrival in the UK. In April, the judge ordered she be placed for adoption in the UK and that her name be changed. He said that Lucy “needs to have the best opportunities going forward in the world”, and that can “only be done in a placement in an alternative family”. The judge added that she would be provided with “background” about her heritage and told what happened in her past. He found that Ossai and his British wife had a genuine desire to adopt Lucy. Julian Bild, an immigration lawyer for anti-trafficking charity Atleu, said in circumstances where a woman is a UK national and a child is a UK national via adoption or otherwise, “it is likely the family would be allowed to stay here”. It is possible for a child to receive British citizenship if they are brought to and physically adopted in the UK, he said. But he added that it is “very, very unlikely that a Nigerian could simply adopt a child to improve their immigration situation and get away with it because that would be pretty transparent”. “A person seeking to bring a child to the UK for the purpose of adoption would first need to get a Certificate of Eligibility from the UK government before being able to do so. “The genuineness for all of this to happen is obviously looked at very closely by the family courts, social workers and experts to ensure the arrangement is in the best interests of the child. ” The Home Office said it could not comment on individual cases and therefore could not clarify whether Ossai and Olasanoye had been removed from the UK. A Home Office spokesperson said: “Foreign nationals who commit crime should be in no doubt that we will do everything to make sure they are not free to roam Britain’s streets, including removing them from the UK at the earliest possible opportunity. “Since the election we’ve removed 3,594 foreign criminals, a 16% increase on the same period 12 months prior. ” The Nigerian High Commission did not respond to our requests for comment.

She had met the little girl when she was just over a year old, in October 2023. “It was really sad when I met her,” a social worker told the court. Giving evidence, she said it was as though the child did not realise “she was actually a person”. “She was so lost, and not really present… she just felt so alone yet she was surrounded by people,” she added. During an observation session, the social worker said Lucy became very “panicky” when her foster carer stood up to leave the room. She also displayed an “extreme cry” that was “very difficult to soothe”. When asked whether Lucy could have been traumatised by the flight or by her transfer to care, the social worker said she believes it is unlikely that alone was to blame. She added that if Lucy had developed a secure attachment to Ossai, that would have been transferred to her foster carer. The judge said the child lacked “basic parental attachment” but did not make a finding on the cause. “I am sure that her being brought into this country illegally and thus separated from her carers is bound to be a significant factor,” he said. Although Ossai has been sentenced to be deported, he and his British wife asked the High Court to assess them to care for Lucy. Ossai said that he thought of Lucy as his daughter. His lawyers said that as the Nigerian authorities had approved him as her foster parent, the English court had no power to take her away. Lucy had always been happy with him, Ossai said, and he thought taking her into care had upset her, especially placing her with white foster carers. “The white may be strange to her,” he added. “When they took her from me I saw the way she was looking at them. ” His lawyers raised concerns that if Lucy were adopted by a white family, she would lose her cultural identity. Ossai’s British wife said Lucy “is like that precious gift that I desired so much”. She told the High Court she would do “anything and everything” for her, adding “I see her as my child”. Both broke down and cried in court when they talked about the little girl. The High Court Judge hearing the case, Sir Jonathan Cohen, rejected Ossai and his British wife’s application to be assessed to care for Lucy. He said the lies they had told and the actions they had taken, especially moving Lucy from Nigeria, had “inevitably caused her very significant emotional harm”. Lucy has been placed with several different foster carers and is residing in at least her third new home since her arrival in the UK. In April, the judge ordered she be placed for adoption in the UK and that her name be changed. He said that Lucy “needs to have the best opportunities going forward in the world”, and that can “only be done in a placement in an alternative family”. The judge added that she would be provided with “background” about her heritage and told what happened in her past. He found that Ossai and his British wife had a genuine desire to adopt Lucy. Julian Bild, an immigration lawyer for anti-trafficking charity Atleu, said in circumstances where a woman is a UK national and a child is a UK national via adoption or otherwise, “it is likely the family would be allowed to stay here”. It is possible for a child to receive British citizenship if they are brought to and physically adopted in the UK, he said. But he added that it is “very, very unlikely that a Nigerian could simply adopt a child to improve their immigration situation and get away with it because that would be pretty transparent”. “A person seeking to bring a child to the UK for the purpose of adoption would first need to get a Certificate of Eligibility from the UK government before being able to do so. “The genuineness for all of this to happen is obviously looked at very closely by the family courts, social workers and experts to ensure the arrangement is in the best interests of the child. ” The Home Office said it could not comment on individual cases and therefore could not clarify whether Ossai and Olasanoye had been removed from the UK. A Home Office spokesperson said: “Foreign nationals who commit crime should be in no doubt that we will do everything to make sure they are not free to roam Britain’s streets, including removing them from the UK at the earliest possible opportunity. “Since the election we’ve removed 3,594 foreign criminals, a 16% increase on the same period 12 months prior. ” The Nigerian High Commission did not respond to our requests for comment.

    "title": "New: Could South America benefit from Trump's trade tariffs?",
    "body": "2025/04/25 - According to new developments, When Donald Trump revealed the level of trade tariffs that countries around the world would face from the US, nations in South America breathed a sigh of relief. Ten of the 12 states on the continent received the lowest level of 10%. Only Guyana and Venezuela were initially hit with higher rates of 38% and 15% respectively, before these were subsequently reduced to 10%. This came as Trump decided to pause elevated rates on almost all countries for 90 days. The exceptions are China, which has been hit with 145%, and Canada and Mexico, which have still got 25% tariffs on some exports to the US. Commentators who describe this as a win for South America argue that the higher US tariffs on China, and on Canada and Mexico, could make South American goods more attractive to US and global buyers. While plausible, this view oversimplifies broader global trade instability that South America is also exposed to. Here I’ll set out this debate – starting with the potential upsides for the region. South America is rich in commodities. Its biggest economies - Brazil and Argentina - are major exporters of soybeans and petroleum as well as, in Brazil’s case, iron ore used in steel production. The US’s huge tariffs on Chinese goods, and China’s retaliatory 125% on US imports, may create opportunities for South American exporters. For example, Brazil could increase agricultural exports to China to replace previous US supplies. China is already Brazil’s largest export destination, followed by the US. There is a precedent. When Trump hit China with tariffs during his first term of office, China shifted some commodity purchases from the US to Brazil, boosting Brazilian soybean exports. With the 2025 soybean harvest in Brazil now continuing, some are hoping for a repeat. These include Frederico D’Avila, a farmer and ex-politician aligned with former Brazilian President Bolsonaro. Mr D’Avila was also previously a senior figure at Aprosoja, a soybean producers’ group. He tells the BBC that President Trump’s first term was “excellent for Brazilian agriculture” as “Trump’s tariffs in that time favoured us”. However, Juan Carlos Hallak, professor of international economics at the University of Buenos Aires, has a counterpoint. He says that raising “bilateral barriers” on commodities mostly just affects “who sells to whom”, and not financial gains for the sellers - as the prices are set globally. So his suggestion is that South American nations shouldn’t expect more financial gains from their commodities as a result of Trump’s actions, just potentially different customers. “The prices are [instead] affected by macroeconomic factors… for example if there is a recession,” he tells the BBC. Yet other sectors in South America are also hoping that Trump’s actions mean they could win more global sales as countries decide to buy less from the US. Take the Brazilian beef industry. The country’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was recently in Japan, hoping to open the Japanese market to Brazil’s beef exports. Japan currently buys 40% of its beef from the US. But after Trump initially threatened to hit the country with 24% tariffs, Tokyo may shift to buy more meat from South America. Other Brazilian industries, such as coffee and footwear, may gain a competitive edge over their Asian counterparts in the US market. Brazil is the world’s biggest producer of coffee, followed by Vietnam, Indonesia and Colombia. Trump initially hit Vietnam with tariffs of 46% and Indonesia with 32%. While those higher rates are now on pause, if they are reinstated in July it will make beans from those two countries significantly more expensive in the US. This would give both Brazilian and Colombian coffee a competitive advantage in the US, where they are already the main suppliers. Meanwhile, Brazil’s shoemakers could see more exports to the US as a result of Trump’s high tariffs on Chinese exports. Currently China is the world’s largest manufacturer of footwear while Brazil is in fifth place. The other three nations in the top five list of the world’s largest footwear producers are India, Vietnam and Indonesia. The US initially gave India a higher tariff rate of 26%. Uruguay’s new President Yamandú Orsi has also said that Trump’s tariffs are helping to push a trade deal between the EU and South America’s bloc, Mercosur, closer to reality. He said that “Europe has little choice now but to lower its demands somewhat” in negotiations, as it seeks to diversify trading partners. You may have noted a lot of “coulds” and “ifs”. That’s not just because it is early days. It’s also because the pace and scale of US trade changes are causing wider instability. Whether the potential positives for South America outweigh the potential negatives is hard to calculate accurately, which brings me to the risks for the continent. Firstly, 10% is still 10%. Even countries with the lower tariff rate may face reduced US demand if prices rise. This is more of a risk for imports that compete with US domestic production, such as oil, soybeans, copper, iron ore, gold, and lithium. The US has also hit imports of aluminium and steel, from all countries, with tariffs of 25%. Brazil is a producer of both metals and has large reserves of their raw materials – bauxite and iron ore.  Meanwhile, Argentina has one of the largest aluminium producers in South America, listed company Aluar, and a smaller steel industry. Argentine producers warn they may both lose US access and face more Chinese imports, creating increased competition for domestic producers. “We’re worried by the diversion of what can no longer enter the US,” Carlos Vaccaro, executive director of the Argentine Steel Chamber, told the Buenos Aires Herald. Trump’s tariff wars have also led to global commodity price volatility, with oil and copper prices seeing slumps. Copper hit a 17-month low at the start of April. This volatility could hit the economies of Chile and Peru, where copper is the top export. Eduardo Levy Yeyati, a former chief economist at the Central Bank of Argentina, says the impact on commodity prices and global demand is a “serious headwind” for South America. Looking ahead, Mr Yeyati says that if Brazil and Argentina do end up enjoying a big rise in exports to the US, it could result in them getting higher tariffs from Trump. After all, Trump’s aim is to boost domestic production, not imports from other countries. Mr Yeyati says that Trump may be equally displeased if South American nations start exporting more to China. “If Brazil fills in the US quota of goods exports to China, the US may choose to punish Brazil. ” He theorises that Trump could also try to pressure Latin America to reduce China’s footprint in the region in return for favourable treatment. China invests billions of dollars in infrastructure projects across Central and South America. So, calling Trump’s tariffs a clear “win” or “loss” for South America oversimplifies a complex situation. Especially if Trump announces in July that every country except China, Canada and Mexico will continue at 10%. As Mr Hallak says: “It’s very hard to predict where this is going. ” Subject to this caveat, he envisions a future where the US protects its manufacturing industries more than its agricultural goods. But adds: “I’m not sure Latin America is ready to take advantage of those opportunities. There will be specific opportunities for sure, but something that changes the game? I don’t think so. ” "

As Mr Hallak says: “It’s very hard to predict where this is going. ” Subject to this caveat, he envisions a future where the US protects its manufacturing industries more than its agricultural goods. But adds: “I’m not sure Latin America is ready to take advantage of those opportunities. There will be specific opportunities for sure, but something that changes the game? I don’t think so. ” "

    "title": "Update: Reeves suggests UK trade with EU more crucial than US",
    "body": "2025/04/25 - It has been recently reported that The UK’s trade relationship with the EU is arguably “more important” than the one it has with the US, the chancellor has told the BBC. Rachel Reeves suggested that moving closer to the EU on trade was a bigger priority, despite her current focus on talks with the US. After her meeting with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Friday, Reeves tweeted that both the UK and US want a deal that is “in both our national interests”. Earlier this week, she signalled the UK could lower tariffs on US car imports from their current 10% to 2. 5% as part of a wider deal. The UK is preparing for a summit with the EU in May in an attempt to “reset” the relationship between the two. “I understand why there’s so much focus on our trading relationship with the US but actually our trading relationship with Europe is arguably even more important, because they’re our nearest neighbours and trading partners,” she told the BBC. “Obviously I’ve been meeting Scott Bessent this week whilst I’m in Washington, but I’ve also this week met the French, the German, the Spanish, the Polish, the Swedish, the Finnish finance ministers - because it is so important that we rebuild those trading relationships with our nearest neighbours in Europe, and we’re going to do that in a way that is good for British jobs and British consumers. ” A Downing Street spokesman said the chancellor’s remarks had been “a statement of fact that the EU is our largest trading partner”. The spokesman also highlighted comments that Sir Keir Starmer has made previously where he had said it was a “false choice between the EU and the US”. Reeves said this week that the government is working “flat out” to secure a trade deal with the US. She has said she wants to see “free and fair” trade, and wants to deepen the relationship between the US and UK in areas such as technology. Conservative shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith told Sky News that his party would “absolutely be seeking to prioritise” a deal with the US over the EU. Griffith argued that the UK already had a tariff-free deal on goods with the EU, therefore the “next best choice if you want to grow the economy after the chancellor’s crashed it would be to get a deal with the US”. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper MP said: “The chancellor is absolutely right that our trading relationship with Europe is more important, but the government’s approach so far shows these are little more than empty words. “This government has bent over backwards to appease Donald Trump but barely lifted a finger to unleash growth by boosting trade with Europe. ” Regarding the situation with the US, Reeves said she “understands what President [Donald] Trump wants to address” with his tariffs, ahead of talks with her US counterpart in Washington. Reeves said there were similarities with the way both the US and UK governments had come to power off the back of voter frustration with the economy. “We’re all grappling with this issue of tariffs but I think that there is an understanding why President Trump wants to address some of the global imbalances there are in the system,” she said. Trump has already imposed tariffs of 25% on all car imports to the US including from the UK. The UK also faces a broader tariff rate of 10% and is looking to negotiate an agreement with the US administration, along with dozens of other countries hit with even higher levies – most of which are currently on pause until July. Some US officials have been positive about the prospects of a deal. Last week US Vice-President JD Vance said there was a “good chance” a trade deal could be reached with the UK. Reeves said she had also been working closely with European and Canadian counterparts to remove trade barriers, and that conversations around the table at G20 meetings this week had been difficult. “Obviously there are strains. We are all following what’s happening in our domestic bond markets, in our equity markets, and we all know that that uncertainty is bad for investment in the UK economy. ” You can watch Faisal’s full interview with Rachel Reeves here.

    "title": "Breaking: Reddin's vision to lift Welsh rugby from low ebb",
    "body": "2025/04/25 - Experts revealed that Dave Reddin was part of the British and Irish Lions backroom staff in New Zealand in 2005 Finally the worst kept secret in Welsh rugby has been confirmed, with Dave Reddin unveiled at Principality Stadium as Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) director of rugby. Having worked with World Cup-winning rugby coach Sir Clive Woodward and England football manager Gareth Southgate, as well as helping guide Team GB at the London 2012 Olympics, Reddin has been identified as the man to fix the problem that is Welsh rugby. In his first public address, Reddin certainly looked and sounded the part, with a polished routine in his smart suit. The message was that the only way is up as Reddin spoke about his responsibility to appoint a new men’s head coach, how he is not afraid to have tough conversations and how he hopes to lift Welsh rugby from a low ebb. A sit down with the WRU’s new DOR Dave Reddin Reddin unveiled as new WRU director of rugby Wales target Tandy for vacant head coach role WRU to revamp nation’s top women’s teams Welsh Rugby Union chief executive Abi Tierney (left) says Dave Reddin was the governing body’s first choice as director of rugby Sitting next to his new boss, WRU chief executive Abi Tierney, Reddin started by outlining why he has taken a job he describes as “a real standout opportunity”. “Global rugby has probably been grieving for Wales and where they have been recently,” he said. “That chance to be involved in a system at a low point, but [which] has the motivation for change, is something that inspired me. “At the beginning of the process I was trying to assess whether it was the right opportunity or not. Talking to Abi and Richard [Collier-Keywood, WRU chairman], the vision they had it was compelling. “It’s about changing a system to create one that is authentically Welsh, that capitalises on the advantages Wales has as a small country, the proximity between regions and national team. “It’s about turning that into a genuine advantage other nations find difficult to overcome. ” Jamie Roberts (left) and Dan Biggar (right) are both British and Irish Lions Reddin revealed he had talked to key rugby figures about taking on the position. Among those were Dan Biggar, Jamie Roberts and Woodward, who Reddin described as “an influential person in my career”. Reddin consulted others who he preferred not to name who “have been connected to the Welsh system in the past”. “I tried to do some careful thinking so I had my eyes wide open coming in,” he said. “With any job, especially with an organisation or system that is at a low ebb, you want to understand whether things are fixable. “I wanted to spend enough time to understand that and the reason I am here is everybody was able to satisfy my questions in that area. “The genuine sentiment from everybody was positive from the opportunity that was here and what persuaded me in the end it was right. ” Dave Reddin was part of the England rugby national set-up between 1997 and 2006 Reddin insists he is not scared to ruffle some feathers. “It’s about developing good relationships with people,” said Reddin. “What I will say is that I’m not scared to have the tough conversations. “Whilst I want to come in, listen and learn, I don’t want to come in and collude with the culture that’s here. “I think it’s about changing the culture and evolving things because we want to be in a different place in the future to where we are now. ” Nevertheless, Reddin says he does not feel “everything is broken” in Welsh rugby. “I’m sure there’s some bright spots of excellence across the Welsh game at every level,” he added. “That’s the first thing I want to focus on, what’s going well, and that’s always a good foundation, particularly when people are in an environment where results aren’t going well. “It’s very easy to become introspective and negative. Just trying to lift that mindset in the beginning is important to enable us to focus on some of the stuff that inevitably has to change. ” As he steps into Welsh rugby’s cauldron having previously been involved with England, Reddin acknowledged questions will be raised about his expertise in his new post. However, he feels he can bring a useful, outside perspective. “Hopefully I am bringing some different experiences, but also a healthy dose of ignorance, humility and curiosity with that,” said Reddin. “I regard that as a strength because it permits me to look at things with fresh eyes. “I don’t have the emotional connection or history to what has happened. I can look at things with a free slate and see things like others have not before. “It does not mean I have all the answers and knowledge. I won’t get it all right. I will make mistakes, but I’ll make them with good intention. ” Steve Tandy has been the Scotland defence coach since 2019 The first thing in Reddin’s in-tray is the job of appointing a new men’s head coach after Warren Gatland departed during the Six Nations, with Cardiff’s Matt Sherratt taking over in a caretaker role role for the final three games. Gatland’s long-term successor will report directly to Reddin. “It’s my responsibility to lead that and I’m accountable for that decision,” said Reddin. “Clearly the most important decision is going to be the head coach and that is where my attention goes first. “I need to get heavily involved in that and we have a plan to do that which needs to be rigorous. That will take a bit more time, but that’s right because we don’t want this to be a short-term appointment. ” Current Scotland coach Steve Tandy has emerged as an early favourite for the job but Reddin says the search remains an open process. “There were 150 names on the list and he (Tandy) will definitely be one of them because it is almost every coach in world rugby,” said Reddin. “There is a process ongoing and that will run to a natural conclusion. ” Tierney has said a caretaker coach could take the men’s side to Japan in July if no permanent candidate has been appointed by then. Dave Reddin helped Gareth Southgate’s England national men’s football side reach the 2018 World Cup semi-finals Reddin arrives at a point when Wales’ men’s side have lost 17 Test matches in a row and the women’s team are on the brink of another Six Nations wooden spoon. So how much time should he be given to turn things around? “I don’t know if I am honest,” said Reddin. “The journey to success in Welsh rugby won’t go in a straight line. I know we’ll be judged by results on the field. That’s the public marker of success. “Sustained success takes longer - the green shoots don’t always appear on the field immediately. “What I would lean on is that experience has told me things can happen a little bit quicker than we expect at times. “But I don’t think it’s realistic to expect our teams to go from where they are to suddenly winning on a consistent basis in the Six Nations. ” Reddin, though, says he is eyeing an initial upturn in fortunes. “The marker in the short-term is tangible improvement in performances and results,” said Reddin. “I know patience is in short supply, but I’m going to ask for a bit more as I understand the system and start to build for the future. ” "

    "title": "Latest: Gatwick to accept 'stricter limits' on plane noise",
    "body": "2025/04/25 - Experts revealed that Gatwick Airport has said it will accept stricter limits on aircraft noise and has put forward what it called improved plans in response to the government’s approval for a second runway. Last month Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said that she was “minded” to give consent for the airport to bring its second runway into use. Gatwick has now responded to the Secretary of State’s letter with what it called an “improved noise scheme for local residents. ” The airport also said it accepts a requirement to have 54% of passengers using public transport before it brings the Northern Runway into operation - but it needs support. Gatwick said it needs help from third parties, including the Department for Transport, to support delivery of the conditions and improvements required to meet the target. This would include reinstating the full Gatwick Express train service, the airport said. It also said if the 54% public transport target is not achieved then an alternative cars-on-the-road limit should be met instead. If neither the public transport mode share or the cars-on-the-road limit are met, then the second runway would be delayed until £350m of road improvements have been completed, it said.

    "body": "2025/04/25 - According to new developments, Gatwick Airport has said it will accept stricter limits on aircraft noise and has put forward what it called improved plans in response to the government’s approval for a second runway. Last month Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said that she was “minded” to give consent for the airport to bring its second runway into use. Gatwick has now responded to the Secretary of State’s letter with what it called an “improved noise scheme for local residents. ” The airport also said it accepts a requirement to have 54% of passengers using public transport before it brings the Northern Runway into operation - but it needs support. Gatwick said it needs help from third parties, including the Department for Transport, to support delivery of the conditions and improvements required to meet the target. This would include reinstating the full Gatwick Express train service, the airport said. It also said if the 54% public transport target is not achieved then an alternative cars-on-the-road limit should be met instead.

    "title": "New: Hairdresser fears she could lose home over tax hikes",
    "body": "2025/04/25 - It has been recently reported that “I never wanted to do anything else but be a hairdresser,” said Kerry Larcher, who opened her first salon when she was 21-years-old. Despite successfully growing her business in Hornchurch, in East London, over three decades, the 50-year-old says she now faces losing her life’s work and her home. Tax rises in October’s Budget are “crippling” her salon business, she said, and the extra £23,000 a year imposed by the chancellor could prove the final nail in the coffin. “I have been crying myself to sleep because, since October, this has been the worst period of my personal life in 30 years,” she said. “I feel ashamed to get into debt but we are gradually eating through our business reserves and I can’t take wages if I don’t make a profit. “I could lose my house if the business folds - that is the reality and if things don’t change it is frightening the life out of me. ” The government says the tax changes announced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves were needed to stabilise the economy. They say their plan to reform business rates will mean lower taxes for High Street businesses such as hair salons when it comes into effect in 2026-27. But salon owners fear this may come too late to save their businesses. Cutting a client’s hair, Kerry explained she could not afford to take on any new apprentices this year and had been forced to reduce the hours of her current 12 apprentices to the minimum. The next step will be to halve the number of apprentices over the next year as their contracts finish, ending up with six by the end of this year. If the business cannot recover over the next four years, the rest of her 28 staff, who are nearly all local women who became stylists after serving an apprenticeship at the salon, are facing potential redundancy. “I’m having to drastically reduce my overall employee numbers to cut costs just to survive,” she said. “Where are the future hairdressers going to come from if good, employed salons go out of business?” Kerry added the way the chancellor is treating salons, which overwhelmingly employ women, “totally goes against the objectives of the government” in growing the economy and supporting workers. Part of the pressure is coming from the UK’s Value Added Tax (VAT) rules, which do not allow businesses to reclaim tax on staff costs in the same way they can for goods, putting labour-intensive businesses such as hair or beauty salons at a disadvantage. “If you look at a cafe, one waiter can serve several tables of four customers in the space of an hour and the cafe can reclaim the VAT on all the food and drink they serve,” Kerry explained. “Whereas one salon customer needs attention from the receptionist, the apprentice for hair-washing, and the stylist in that same hour and we can only claim VAT back on a tube of hair colour. ” Many hairdressers went into debt due to the pandemic, said Kerry, and the added pressures of increases in employer National Insurance contributions (Nics) and business rates are now threatening the future of salons across the country. For Kerry’s salon, the Vanilla Rooms, the tax increases have added a “devastating” £23,000 extra to her annual costs, through a combination of the threshold at which employers start to pay Nics on staff wages being lowered to £5,000 and changes to business rates. Her Nics costs have risen 29%, from about £42,000 to about £54,500 - now costing more than £1,000 a week - and business rates have gone up by 144%, from about £7,000 to about £18,000 a year. Kerry is one of 50,000 UK hairdressing professionals represented by the British Hair Consortium (BHC), which has urged Rachel Reeves to take action or face the “collapse” of the industry due to rising costs. The BHC argues the most efficient support the government could offer is through halving VAT for salons, because staff wages make up 60% of their costs. The association says cutting VAT could actually increase overall tax take, by preventing more workers going self-employed or entering the black market. Kerry’s case was one of those raised by Conservative MP Julia Lopez in a debate this week in Parliament’s Westminster Hall, where she urged Rachel Reeves to lower VAT from 20% to 10% to support the hair and beauty sector. Lopez, the MP for Hornchurch and Upminster, said Kerry was not alone in being forced to consider whether she will have to shut up shop completely. “Some of the increased bills for salons are just unbelievable,” she said, adding that women were disproportionately impacted by the changes. “It’s hard to ignore the impact, let alone the irony, of a chancellor celebrating herself for being the first woman to hold that office while simultaneously hammering the sectors that employ, serve and are often led, by women. ” Liberal Democrat business spokesperson Sarah Gibson agreed that Reeves’ Budget had implemented “an unfair tax on jobs” and the government must offer tax relief for small businesses in June. Gibson said an increasing number of salons are opting to rent chairs out to self-employed staff, instead of employing stylists directly, to avoid paying tax. “If salons don’t get support we will see a huge increase in people becoming chair renters,” she said, which reduces the Treasury’s overall tax take. Responding for the Labour government, Small Business Minister Gareth Thomas defended the chancellor’s decisions in her October Budget as “important for long term stability”. Salons are “a vital pillar of our high streets”, he said, adding “many hair and beauty businesses will benefit from some of the other measures the chancellor introduced”. “We increased the employment allowance so that almost one million employers pay no national insurance contributions at all. More than half of employers will see no change or gain from that package, and that includes many hair and beauty businesses,” he told MPs. Update 26 April 2025: This article was amended to correct the cost of Kerry’s business rates, which she said increased from about £7,000, not from £700 as we originally stated.

    "title": "Update: 'They're still in it' - how Arsenal can beat Lyon to reach final",
    "body": "2025/04/25 - Let’s dive into the details: Arsenal are the only English team to have won the Women’s Champions League - doing so in 2007 when the competition was known as the Uefa Women’s Cup Uefa Women’s Champions League: Lyon v Arsenal Venue: Groupama Stadium Date: Sunday, 27 April Kick-off: 17:00 BST Coverage: Live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app Arsenal are down, but they’re definitely not out of their Women’s Champions League semi-final against eight-time winners Lyon. The Gunners had more shots, more possession and more touches inside their opponent’s box in the first leg, but ultimately it was Lyon who left Emirates Stadium with a 2-1 lead. Now, Renee Slegers’ side must overturn a deficit in France on Sunday if they are to reach their first Champions League final since 2007, the season in which they won the title. They face a stiff task though, with Lyon unbeaten in the Champions League this season, having conceded just three goals in nine games. They have only been knocked out twice in 15 years after winning the first leg in the knockout stage and on those occasions it was to the now redundant away goals rule. While Chelsea’s hopes of a first European trophy have been left hanging by a thread after their 4-1 first-leg defeat in Barcelona, there is belief Arsenal can still turn things around to ensure there is at least one English team in the final. “This isn’t 4-1. It’s a completely different narrative, Arsenal are still in it. It’s a completely different conversation,” former Gunners defender Jen Beattie said. But how exactly can Arsenal turn it around against a team that have reached the final of the Champions League 11 times in 15 years? Bompastor set for ‘biggest challenge’ of career Womenâs Champions League: Can Chelsea and Arsenal fight back? This video can not be played Why Arsenal must ‘go for it’ against Lyon It wasn’t so long ago that Arsenal put five goals past Lyon on French soil. Playing under Jonas Eidevall - before Slegers had joined as his assistant manager - the Gunners outclassed the reigning champions in the group stage in 2022. Caitlin Foord, Frida Maanum and Beth Mead, who all started for Slegers on Saturday, were on the scoresheet. But Arsenal lacked that ruthlessness against Lyon last Saturday, with Mead, Maanum, Foord and Alessia Russo missing multiple chances. “Arsenal showed enough in this first leg to take confidence,” ex-England defender Anita Asante told the Football News Show. “They really dominated the ball, they had control in the final third, created a number of chances and they just missed some of that cutting edge. ” Kadidiatou Diani beat Arsenal’s offside trap to get behind their defence and she made no mistake with a crisp finish for a 17th-minute opener. And just as the hosts had pulled level through Mariona Caldentey’s spot-kick, Lyon split their backline open with Ada Hegerberg pulling Leah Williamson out of position to open up space for Melchie Dumornay, who darted into the box and lifted the ball over Manuela Zinsberger. “Lyon under Joe Montemurro are not afraid to not have the ball. They get the goals they need, sit back and don’t seek to dominate necessarily,” Asante added. “They’re a team that will play in transition and their players, especially in that front three, are all really dynamic and can play into space, carry the ball or threat in the box. “I don’t think it suits Arsenal necessarily to play on the counter. They will probably assess the first 10-15 minutes of the game and adapt from there. ” Despite their first-leg defeat, Beattie does not expect Arsenal to play “very differently”. “I think they got the press wrong once and Diani scored. I can’t think of many other times where Lyon played through from a goal kick,” she said. “I think the Arsenal press was very, very good and if they do that again, they can go and get a result. ” Slegers said Arsenal must be wary of “a lot of threats”, but that her side have the ability to “expose” Lyon. “We’re super humble for the task because they probably have the next level in them - but so do we,” she said. Kadidiatou Diani v Katie McCabe With a front three made up of Diani, Dumornay and Tabitha Chawinga, Lyon are never going to be easy to contain. Arsenal’s full-back Katie McCabe, usually seen powering up and down the left flank, was more reserved when pitted against the rapid Diani in the first leg. The winger found space by drifting infield between McCabe and Steph Catley and it was this movement that gifted Lyon the first goal, with Ellie Carpenter threading the ball through Arsenal’s defence to put Diani one-on-one with Zinsberger. Post-match Lyon boss Montemurro said that was a key tactic they had identified to restrict McCabe’s impact. “Of course, I respect Diani and the whole Lyon team because of what they’ve achieved, but also we know our qualities and our strengths, especially going forward,” McCabe said. “And for me, that is one of my strengths, making forward runs and driving into spaces and delivering a ball into the box. ” McCabe’s pass map against Real Madrid (left) and Lyon (right) Wendie Renard v Alessia Russo One of the key questions for Slegers’ side before the second leg is whether Wendie Renard will be back in the starting XI to make her 500th appearance for Lyon. The 6ft 2in defender - known for her aerial prowess - was on the bench on Saturday after recovering from a foot injury. “Crosses in the box were really effective [and] I think that’s where Arsenal’s best chances came from, but if Renard is back it is a different game, different tactics,” Beattie said. “[Arsenal will] have to play more passes in and around the box and break them down. ” Arsenal scored all three of their goals from crosses during their second-leg comeback against Real Madrid in the quarter-finals, but they failed to make any of their 25 crosses count in the first leg against Lyon. Russo, the Gunners’ top scorer with 18 goals this season, will want to more involved and put herself in dangerous areas after having just four touches inside Lyon’s box. Lindsey Heaps v Mariona Caldentey Mariona Caldentey knows what it takes to win the Champions League. The Spaniard won three European titles in four years with Barcelona before moving to Arsenal in July, and she’s carried that winning mentality into this season. Having scored in Arsenal’s comeback against Real Madrid, Caldentey kept cool under the pressure to convert from the penalty spot against Lyon - her eighth goal involvement in this season’s Champions League. But it’s not just her ability in attack that has helped Arsenal this term. The midfielder won more duels (nine) and tackles (three) than any other player in the first leg as she helped Arsenal dominate possession. However, Caldentey is up against another serial winner in Lindsey Heaps - known as Lindsey Horan before switching to her married name - in the middle of the park. . Despite being forced to settle for less possession by Arsenal, Heaps illustrated her importance to the French giants by kickstarting the attack for Lyon’s second goal at the Emirates with a midfield-splitting pass to Hegerberg.

Playing under Jonas Eidevall - before Slegers had joined as his assistant manager - the Gunners outclassed the reigning champions in the group stage in 2022. Caitlin Foord, Frida Maanum and Beth Mead, who all started for Slegers on Saturday, were on the scoresheet. But Arsenal lacked that ruthlessness against Lyon last Saturday, with Mead, Maanum, Foord and Alessia Russo missing multiple chances. “Arsenal showed enough in this first leg to take confidence,” ex-England defender Anita Asante told the Football News Show. “They really dominated the ball, they had control in the final third, created a number of chances and they just missed some of that cutting edge. ” Kadidiatou Diani beat Arsenal’s offside trap to get behind their defence and she made no mistake with a crisp finish for a 17th-minute opener. And just as the hosts had pulled level through Mariona Caldentey’s spot-kick, Lyon split their backline open with Ada Hegerberg pulling Leah Williamson out of position to open up space for Melchie Dumornay, who darted into the box and lifted the ball over Manuela Zinsberger. “Lyon under Joe Montemurro are not afraid to not have the ball. They get the goals they need, sit back and don’t seek to dominate necessarily,” Asante added. “They’re a team that will play in transition and their players, especially in that front three, are all really dynamic and can play into space, carry the ball or threat in the box. “I don’t think it suits Arsenal necessarily to play on the counter. They will probably assess the first 10-15 minutes of the game and adapt from there. ” Despite their first-leg defeat, Beattie does not expect Arsenal to play “very differently”. “I think they got the press wrong once and Diani scored. I can’t think of many other times where Lyon played through from a goal kick,” she said. “I think the Arsenal press was very, very good and if they do that again, they can go and get a result. ” Slegers said Arsenal must be wary of “a lot of threats”, but that her side have the ability to “expose” Lyon. “We’re super humble for the task because they probably have the next level in them - but so do we,” she said. Kadidiatou Diani v Katie McCabe With a front three made up of Diani, Dumornay and Tabitha Chawinga, Lyon are never going to be easy to contain. Arsenal’s full-back Katie McCabe, usually seen powering up and down the left flank, was more reserved when pitted against the rapid Diani in the first leg. The winger found space by drifting infield between McCabe and Steph Catley and it was this movement that gifted Lyon the first goal, with Ellie Carpenter threading the ball through Arsenal’s defence to put Diani one-on-one with Zinsberger. Post-match Lyon boss Montemurro said that was a key tactic they had identified to restrict McCabe’s impact. “Of course, I respect Diani and the whole Lyon team because of what they’ve achieved, but also we know our qualities and our strengths, especially going forward,” McCabe said. “And for me, that is one of my strengths, making forward runs and driving into spaces and delivering a ball into the box. ” McCabe’s pass map against Real Madrid (left) and Lyon (right) Wendie Renard v Alessia Russo One of the key questions for Slegers’ side before the second leg is whether Wendie Renard will be back in the starting XI to make her 500th appearance for Lyon. The 6ft 2in defender - known for her aerial prowess - was on the bench on Saturday after recovering from a foot injury. “Crosses in the box were really effective [and] I think that’s where Arsenal’s best chances came from, but if Renard is back it is a different game, different tactics,” Beattie said. “[Arsenal will] have to play more passes in and around the box and break them down. ” Arsenal scored all three of their goals from crosses during their second-leg comeback against Real Madrid in the quarter-finals, but they failed to make any of their 25 crosses count in the first leg against Lyon. Russo, the Gunners’ top scorer with 18 goals this season, will want to more involved and put herself in dangerous areas after having just four touches inside Lyon’s box. Lindsey Heaps v Mariona Caldentey Mariona Caldentey knows what it takes to win the Champions League. The Spaniard won three European titles in four years with Barcelona before moving to Arsenal in July, and she’s carried that winning mentality into this season. Having scored in Arsenal’s comeback against Real Madrid, Caldentey kept cool under the pressure to convert from the penalty spot against Lyon - her eighth goal involvement in this season’s Champions League. But it’s not just her ability in attack that has helped Arsenal this term. The midfielder won more duels (nine) and tackles (three) than any other player in the first leg as she helped Arsenal dominate possession. However, Caldentey is up against another serial winner in Lindsey Heaps - known as Lindsey Horan before switching to her married name - in the middle of the park. . Despite being forced to settle for less possession by Arsenal, Heaps illustrated her importance to the French giants by kickstarting the attack for Lyon’s second goal at the Emirates with a midfield-splitting pass to Hegerberg.

    "title": "New: Why Trump keeps attacking the US central bank",
    "body": "2025/04/25 - Experts revealed that US President Donald Trump has some well-known nemeses: illegal immigrants, low-flow showers and last, but definitely not least, the head of the US central bank. Elevated by Trump to lead the Federal Reserve starting in 2018, Jerome Powell almost immediately found himself under fire - described on social media as a bonehead and questioned about reports that the president wanted him gone. But however uncomfortable Powell might have been then, his position has only gotten worse. Not only is he overseeing an economy where the risk of recession is rapidly rising, Trump has been flirting publicly with his removal, writing on social media last week: “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Coming at a time when Trump has pushed to expand presidential power, while cowing political opponents and ploughing past judicial efforts to check his action, it has raised alarm that he is more serious about, and might be more able to, exert control over the Fed than during his first term. The tensions cooled this week, when Trump, a day after a market slide that some analysts tied to the comments, denied to reporters that he ever had any intention of firing Powell. It came amid other hints of de-escalation in Trump’s economic rhetoric as his policies, especially trade tariffs, have faced rising political and business backlash. But Trump did not offer much assurance that he would limit his interventions at the Fed, maintaining his right to have a view and noting that he might call Powell to discuss his concerns about the bank’s interest rate policy. Donald Kohn, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the former vice chair of the Federal Reserve, said the shift in tone appeared intended to calm financial markets but he did not think it marked the end of a fight over the Fed, an institution considered vital to the health of the world’s largest economy. “It’s a testimony to the market’s response,” he said. “But I think it’s way too soon to say that there’s a stability there. ” Trump’s clash with the Fed is ostensibly rooted in differences over where the bank should fix its key interest rate, which plays an influential role shaping borrowing costs for credit cards, mortgages and other loans. Lower rates make it easier to borrow and tend to deliver an economic boost. Higher interest rates dampen activity, helping to keep prices stable. Trump, who cut his teeth professionally taking out loans as a property developer, has long confessed to liking a low interest rate policy. He objected when the Fed raised rates in his first term and has been pushing Powell to cut them now, arguing that inflation has cooled and keeping rates too high could do unnecessary economic damage. “There can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW,” he wrote on social media earlier this week, referring to Powell. Trump is hardly the first politician to cast the bank as a scapegoat at a moment of economic turmoil - or to press for lower interest rates. Nor is he alone in his criticism of Powell, who infamously initially dismissed post-pandemic price inflation as “transitory” and has been faulted for being too focused on backward-looking data. Trump’s pressure on the bank, however, breaks with Washington tradition in recent decades of presidential deference to the Fed. It has drawn comparisons to former President Richard Nixon, who pushed his Fed chairman to loosen its policies ahead of the 1972 election, moves later blamed for feeding the high-inflation, low-growth “stagflationary” dynamic of that decade. The idea that Trump could exert control over the Fed elicits horror among many economists, who say history is littered with examples of countries where political interference at central banks led to spiralling prices and economic ruin. Sarah Binder, professor at George Washington University and a scholar of the Federal Reserve, said confidence in Fed independence is key to maintaining market faith that inflation will be controlled. If shaken, it could lead to higher borrowing costs for everyone, as investors demand higher interest rates for holding debt, she warned, noting that should the Fed eventually cut rates, it is likely to spark speculation about Trump’s influence - regardless of how, if at all, it played into the decision. “That’s ultimately the problem. It is perceptions of independence that really matter and that’s what the pernicious effects of the attacks are they do raise doubts about whether the Fed can be as stalwart as central bankers want to be,” she said. Joe Lavorgna, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, who served on the National Economic Council during Trump’s first term, said he saw little need for Trump to dial back his attacks, noting that he was making a “very classic macro argument” about the bank’s flaws. “I’m completely on board with the president’s sympathies or comments that the Fed has historically been late,” he said, adding that he thought stock market falls had been driven primarily by questions about trade policy. He said he believed that Fed officials would remain more responsive to financial conditions than the president, noting that, if anything, Trump’s pressure could make it more hesitant to cut, lest it be perceived as being cowed. “Ultimately the Fed is going to do what’s prudent,” he said. “The question is just the timing. ” Powell, a longtime Washington lawyer whose term as chair is due to end next year, has maintained that he is unbothered - and uninfluenced - by the criticism and asserted that Trump does not have the legal authority to remove him. But the strength of his position is a matter of legal debate. By law, Fed governors can only be removed for cause, but it is unclear whether that protection extends to the role leading the board. The administration has already taken steps to reduce the Fed’s regulatory role and is engaged in a legal battle over expanding presidential authority over other government agencies set up with features, like for cause protections, intended to insulate them from partisan pressure. Mark Spindel, founder and chief investment officer of the Washington-based investment advisory firm Potomac River Capital, who has worked with Prof Binder on Fed studies, noted that the tradition of Fed “independence” had evolved over time, often after political or economic crisis. “Things that are given can be taken away,” he said, hours before Trump appeared to back off. Asked again for his thoughts a few days later, Mr Spindel wrote back just two words in reply: “Damage done. ” "

    "body": "2025/04/25 - Let’s dive into the details: Ben and Tatiana Woollaston have forged separate careers in snooker Ben Woollaston shot into the snooker spotlight with his surprising first-round win against Mark Selby at the World Championship. It was a match between friends and practice partners from Leicester, and one that Selby said before the draw he hoped to avoid. While Selby coughed up what he described as a “pathetic” performance to lose 10-8, Woollaston celebrated arguably the best result of his career in what became a post-midnight finish. A first win at the famous Crucible theatre has been a long time coming for Woollaston, who is now 37. He has suffered with chronic fatigue in recent years and said he was so sickly he was “green” before the final session against Selby. But if the surname rings a bell, then that might not be entirely down to Ben’s snooker achievements alone. Wife Tatiana is one of the sport’s leading referees. She is not allowed to take charge of Ben’s matches to avoid any possible accusations of a conflict of interest, but has officiated on many of the sport’s big occasions and first appeared at the World Championship in 2020. Tatiana Woollaston is regarded as one of snooker’s top referees Ben Woollaston turned professional at the age of 17, and, as might be expected, found it tough initially to get the wins to stay on tour. He flitted between professional and amateur ranks, but since 2009 has been a fixture on the main tour. It was while in Germany for the Paul Hunter Classic in 2010 that Tatiana, making her way in the game as a European Billiards and Snooker Association referee, first encountered Ben. They married in 2011. Tatiana later told BBC Sport: “I had never heard of him. When we met he was 70 or 80 in the world. “I think it improved him a lot and has given him motivation. Maybe it inspired him. ” Woollaston is 44th for now with 2024-25 season earnings of Â£139,900… and counting. He has been as high as 25th. World Championship: Schedule, results &amp; BBC coverage Quiz: What happened in round one at the Crucible? Ben Woollaston won a first minor ranking title in a Players Tour Championship event in Sheffield in 2011, and was one of a number of players with serious promise to emerge at about that time, others including Judd Trump, Jack Lisowski and Anthony McGill. He qualified for the World Championship in 2013, and despite losing in round one to Ali Carter might well have expected to become a Crucible regular. He also reached the 2015 Welsh Open final, where he was beaten by John Higgins. Losing in qualifying for the Worlds became a frustrating and difficult habit to break, and returning to the sport’s most famous stage this year could be considered overdue. The Woollastons have two sons, and their eldest, 12-year-old Edward, joined Tatiana in the Crucible crowd to see Ben crawl over the line at the end of two gruelling sessions against Selby. “It’s amazing for Edward. I don’t know how he did it - to watch five hours one night and five hours the next night,” said Ben Woollaston. “He didn’t miss one shot [and] stayed in there during the interval. It’s amazing that he did it. ” Ben’s win might have cost Edward some bonus pocket money, however, as he had drawn Selby in a World Championship sweepstake at their snooker club with a Â£100 prize up for grabs. “He thought he had a good chance,” Woollaston said. Tatiana also works at the head office of clothes retailer Next, with snooker a part-time occupation, but is one of the most respected refs around. She refereed the UK Championship final between Judd Trump and Barry Hawkins at the York Barbican in December. That was her first final of a Triple Crown event, a possible step towards a Crucible title match for the 38-year-old, who hails from Belarus. Snooker referees spend much of the year away from home World Snooker Tour says this is confidential and would not offer any guidance. For some, though, it is a full-time role and involves extensive world travel. As well as matches on the regular tour, officials might top up their earnings by running the rule over exhibition matches. This has been a lucrative sideline since the sport’s boom years in the 1980s, when the likes of Len Ganley were almost as popular as the top players. As Mike Ganley - World Snooker Tour tournament director and Len’s son - has said: “Len made good money from the exhibitions because for whatever reason he did have a profile, and an ego and a personality that went with it. ” That helps. It is understood that a referee’s basic pay is generally rather modest, certainly compared to the top players. We can confidently say that Ben Woollaston’s World Championship earnings this year will top any referee’s income from the 17 days. Reaching the second round means he is assured of at least Â£30,000. The champion collects Â£500,000. Ben’s plan for Friday was to sleep as much as possible so that he feels fresh to go again when he plays China’s Si Jiahui in round two, in a match that begins on Saturday. He was seen with Tatiana and Edward heading back to their hotel at about 01:00 BST, and while Ben and Edward possibly had a lie-in, there was no such comfort for Tatiana. She was straight back to work, refereeing the second session of the round two match between Mark Allen and Chris Wakelin. That began at 10:00 BST, and it contained what might go down as another career highlight - picking the black ball out of the pocket as Allen became the 11th man to make a 147 maximum break at the World Championship. So far, Sheffield is treating the Woollastons well. Hearn ready for snooker to leave Crucible after 2027 ‘National hero’ - China’s pursuit of an elusive world title "

That was her first final of a Triple Crown event, a possible step towards a Crucible title match for the 38-year-old, who hails from Belarus. Snooker referees spend much of the year away from home World Snooker Tour says this is confidential and would not offer any guidance. For some, though, it is a full-time role and involves extensive world travel. As well as matches on the regular tour, officials might top up their earnings by running the rule over exhibition matches. This has been a lucrative sideline since the sport’s boom years in the 1980s, when the likes of Len Ganley were almost as popular as the top players. As Mike Ganley - World Snooker Tour tournament director and Len’s son - has said: “Len made good money from the exhibitions because for whatever reason he did have a profile, and an ego and a personality that went with it. ” That helps. It is understood that a referee’s basic pay is generally rather modest, certainly compared to the top players. We can confidently say that Ben Woollaston’s World Championship earnings this year will top any referee’s income from the 17 days. Reaching the second round means he is assured of at least Â£30,000. The champion collects Â£500,000. Ben’s plan for Friday was to sleep as much as possible so that he feels fresh to go again when he plays China’s Si Jiahui in round two, in a match that begins on Saturday. He was seen with Tatiana and Edward heading back to their hotel at about 01:00 BST, and while Ben and Edward possibly had a lie-in, there was no such comfort for Tatiana. She was straight back to work, refereeing the second session of the round two match between Mark Allen and Chris Wakelin. That began at 10:00 BST, and it contained what might go down as another career highlight - picking the black ball out of the pocket as Allen became the 11th man to make a 147 maximum break at the World Championship. So far, Sheffield is treating the Woollastons well. Hearn ready for snooker to leave Crucible after 2027 ‘National hero’ - China’s pursuit of an elusive world title "

    "title": "Update: Annual energy bills predicted to fall by £166 in July",
    "body": "2025/04/25 - Experts revealed that Domestic energy prices are forecast to fall in July, reversing three consecutive increases in regulator Ofgem’s price cap. The annual bill of a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will fall by £166 a year, a drop of nearly 9%, analysts at the consultancy Cornwall Insight have predicted. It comes after a series of household bills became more expensive in April, and would mean a typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit would cost £1,683. The price cap is based on the cost of each unit of energy, not the total bill - so if you use more, you pay more. The energy price cap covers around 22 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is set every three months by Ofgem. While the quarterly change can skew annual comparisons, the regulator illustrates the effect of the price cap with the annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity. In the three months from July last year, that typical bill stood at £1,568 a year. It rose on each of the three occasions the cap was set after that, the most recent of which was at the start of April. The predicted fall of almost 9% in July - if it happens - would bring it sharply down to the lowest level since last September. Cornwall Insight also expects a slight fall in prices in October and another drop in January 2026. However, analysts said great uncertainty still surrounded these forecasts. “While a fall in bills will always be welcomed by households, we mustn’t get ahead of ourselves. We have all seen markets go up as fast as they go down, and the very fact the market dropped so quickly shows how vulnerable it is to geopolitical and market shifts,” said Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall Insight, which is widely recognised for the accuracy of its predictions. “There is unfortunately no guarantee that any fall in prices will be sustained. “The only real way to protect households from this constant cycle of instability and insecurity is to reduce our dependence on international wholesale markets. ” The fall in the wholesale cost of energy, paid by suppliers, is behind the latest predictions. That has been affected by US tariffs policy and warmer-than-expected weather in Europe. "

    "body": "2025/04/25 - It has been recently reported that Law-breaking water company executives face tougher punishments, including possible prison sentences, under new powers that have come into force in England and Wales. Bosses who fail to co-operate or obstruct investigators looking into sewage spills can now be jailed for up to two years. The government said the threat of tougher sentences would act as a “powerful deterrent”. At the same time a highly critical report from the public spending watchdog accuses the government and regulators of failing to manage risk and drive investment in the water sector, contributing to higher bills for customers. The National Audit Office’s report said consumer trust was at an “all-time low”. It pointed the finger at the regulators, Ofwat, the Environment Agency and the Drinking Water Inspectorate, as well as at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), for failing to drive improvements to the system. Water companies have come under fire in recent years for allowing more frequent discharging of sewage spills, polluting rivers and lakes. Firms have been accused of paying dividends to shareholders and bonuses to executives, while failing to invest enough money in the water infrastructure to cope with a growing population and more extreme weather. However, it is Defra and the regulators who are jointly responsible for setting the framework the water companies operate under. The government said the new powers to punish executives were needed because in the past water companies had failed to hand over vital evidence related to illegal sewage discharges. Regulation had been “weak and toothless” with no accountability, said Environment Secretary Steve Reed. “It’s shocking that not a single water executive faced a fine, let alone a prison sentence, despite widespread law-breaking,” he told the BBC’s Today programme. Campaign group River Action welcomed the new measures but said they would only be effective if they were used. “Without delivering actual prison sentences, it’s just theatre,” chief executive James Wallace said. “If the government is serious let’s see real jail time, not just headlines. ” Consumers were currently “paying the price for regulatory failure and corporate greed”, he said, and called for an end to the “failed privatisation experiment”. The industry body Water UK said it was right that water companies were held accountable and that the industry was focused on delivering new investment to secure supplies and end sewage spills. Water firms wanted to see “more direction” from government, simpler regulation, and more decisions devolved to local communities, a spokesperson said. Earlier this week Water UK told the BBC it would back a change to the system so that companies would no longer be responsible for monitoring their own levels of sewage pollution. It said a new “more robust” third-party monitoring system should be put in place. Currently, water companies are responsible for sampling water quality themselves to identify pollution. However, there have been incidents of misreporting, which regulators said had sometimes been deliberate. The government has set up an independent commission to review how the sector is run and regulated, which is expected to publish its findings by July. "

    "title": "Update: Retail sales see biggest rise for nearly four years",
    "body": "2025/04/25 - Experts revealed that UK retail sales rose at the fastest pace for nearly four years in the first few months of the year, after warmer weather helped boost sales in March. Between January and March, sales volumes were up 1. 6% from the previous three months, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which was the biggest quarterly rise since July 2021. March’s sunny weather provided a boost for garden centres, and demand for clothing and DIY goods also improved. However, the ONS said food sales volumes fell, particularly at supermarkets. Analysts also warned that sales could weaken in the months ahead after a separate survey suggested consumer confidence fell in April. Sales volumes in March rose 0. 4%, an unexpectedly strong figure after analysts had predicted a 0. 4% fall. Clothing and shoe stores saw the strongest growth, with sales up 3. 7% from the previous month. The sunny weather in March also helped sales at garden centres, which reported “robust trading”, the ONS said. Sales at non-food stores rose by 1. 7% over the month, but this was partly offset by food store sales volumes falling 1. 3%. “March was a real sweet spot for many households with inflation continuing to cool and wage increases not yet ravaged by an increase in bills,” said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell. “For retailers these figures will be heartening, coming after what was a disappointing Christmas for the sector. But most will be braced for a change in fortunes. ” A separate survey indicating that consumer confidence fell sharply in April has suggested that sales may not grow as quickly in the months ahead. Market research firm GfK said confidence fell this month to its lowest level since November 2023, as people faced rising bills and became more pessimistic about the prospects for the economy. “Consumers have not only been grappling with multiple April cost increases in the form of utilities, council tax, stamp duty, and road tax, but they are also hearing dire warnings of renewed high inflation on the back of the Trump tariffs,” said Neil Bellamy, consumer insights director at GfK. However, Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Liberum, noted that the research carried out by GfK was in the first two weeks of April, when the bill rises and tariff announcements were fresh in people’s memories. “The question being asked is whether that was a particularly unfortunate timing and it’s not necessarily reflective of how consumers will feel later in the year,” he told the BBC’s Today programme. “Later in the year we’re expecting interest rate cuts and a fall in energy costs. Will that start to boost consumer sentiment? I suspect it will. ” "

Between January and March, sales volumes were up 1. 6% from the previous three months, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which was the biggest quarterly rise since July 2021. March’s sunny weather provided a boost for garden centres, and demand for clothing and DIY goods also improved. However, the ONS said food sales volumes fell, particularly at supermarkets. Analysts also warned that sales could weaken in the months ahead after a separate survey suggested consumer confidence fell in April. Sales volumes in March rose 0. 4%, an unexpectedly strong figure after analysts had predicted a 0. 4% fall. Clothing and shoe stores saw the strongest growth, with sales up 3. 7% from the previous month. The sunny weather in March also helped sales at garden centres, which reported “robust trading”, the ONS said. Sales at non-food stores rose by 1. 7% over the month, but this was partly offset by food store sales volumes falling 1. 3%. “March was a real sweet spot for many households with inflation continuing to cool and wage increases not yet ravaged by an increase in bills,” said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell. “For retailers these figures will be heartening, coming after what was a disappointing Christmas for the sector. But most will be braced for a change in fortunes. ” A separate survey indicating that consumer confidence fell sharply in April has suggested that sales may not grow as quickly in the months ahead. Market research firm GfK said confidence fell this month to its lowest level since November 2023, as people faced rising bills and became more pessimistic about the prospects for the economy. “Consumers have not only been grappling with multiple April cost increases in the form of utilities, council tax, stamp duty, and road tax, but they are also hearing dire warnings of renewed high inflation on the back of the Trump tariffs,” said Neil Bellamy, consumer insights director at GfK. However, Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Liberum, noted that the research carried out by GfK was in the first two weeks of April, when the bill rises and tariff announcements were fresh in people’s memories. “The question being asked is whether that was a particularly unfortunate timing and it’s not necessarily reflective of how consumers will feel later in the year,” he told the BBC’s Today programme. “Later in the year we’re expecting interest rate cuts and a fall in energy costs. Will that start to boost consumer sentiment? I suspect it will. ” "

    "title": "New: Company bosses warn over tariffs impact",
    "body": "2025/04/25 - It has been recently reported that Top executives at well-known US firms are warning about the impact that tariffs are having on their companies and the wider economy. Technology giant Intel, footwear maker Skechers and consumer goods firm Procter &amp; Gamble, have either cut their profit forecasts or withdrawn them citing economic uncertainty. US President Donald Trump has been trying to rebalance relations with key trading partners by using steep tariffs to bring them to the negotiating table. No new trade agreements between the US and other countries have been announced yet but there have been signs of progress in talks with South Korea. “The very fluid trade policies in the US and beyond, as well as regulatory risks, have increased the chance of an economic slowdown with the probability of a recession growing,” said Intel’s chief financial officer, David Zinsner, during a call with investors. “We will certainly see costs increase,” he added as the California-based firm announced gloomy profit and revenue forecasts. Intel’s shares dropped by more than 5% in extended trading after those remarks. Beyond the technology industry, footwear maker Skechers also disappointed investors. The firm’s shares fell after it withdrew its annual results forecast. “The current environment is simply too dynamic from which to plan results with a reasonable assurance of success,” Skechers’ chief operating officer, David Weinberg, told investors in a post-earnings call. Skechers - like rivals Nike, Adidas and Puma - uses factories in Asia, particularly in China, to make its products. Comments from Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G) executives also hinted at how tariffs could mean higher prices for its customers. The maker of Ariel, Head &amp; Shoulders and Gillette said it was considering changes to its prices to make up for the extra cost of materials sourced from China and other places. It also said it expected sales to grow this year less than previously forecast. “We’ll be looking for every opportunity to mitigate the impact,” said Andre Schulten, P&amp;G’s financial chief, adding that there will be adjustments to “some level of consumer pricing”. The Japanese owner of the 7-Eleven convenience stores, Seven &amp; I, said it is also feeling the impact of the trade tensions. North America account for more than 70% of its sales. Its incoming chief executive, Stephen Dacus, told the BBC about the uncertainty faced by the business. “We don’t know what those tariffs are going to be. We’ve seen some news recently where they have changed quite a bit so it’s a little bit difficult to understand what the ultimate effect is,” he said. “Lowering prices and lowering quality typically doesn’t work… so what you have to do… is find ways to maintain quality while bringing the cost down”. They join a growing list of examples of companies around the world that have warned about the impact of Trump’s trade policies. South Korean car making giant Hyundai announced on Friday that it has set up a task force to find ways to deal with the fallout from tariffs. “We expect a challenging business outlook to continue due to intensifying trade conflicts and other various unpredictable macroeconomic factors,” it said. It added that it is considering moving some manufacturing out of South Korea. The firm has already shifted some production from Mexico to the US, which accounts for about a third of its global sales. Meanwhile, there were signs that talks on Thursday between US and South Korean trade officials in Washington DC, aimed at removing tariffs, have been positive. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the two sides had a “very successful” meeting. “We may be moving faster than I thought, and we will be talking technical terms as early as next week,” he told reporters after the meeting. South Korea’s industry minister, Ahn Duk-geun, who also took part in the talks, echoed Bessent’s optimism and added that they are working toward a “July package”. A 90-day pause on higher tariffs affecting dozens of countries is set to expire on 8 July. Trump has said more than 70 countries have reached out to start negotiations since the tariffs were announced. "

    "title": "New: China has halted rare earth exports, can Australia step up?",
    "body": "2025/04/25 - According to new developments, Australia’s prime minister Anthony Albanese has pledged to invest A$1. 2bn (£580m) in a strategic reserve for critical minerals if he wins next month’s election, as trade tensions escalate. The announcement came after China imposed export restrictions on seven rare earth elements, essential to the production of advanced technologies - including electric vehicles, fighter jets, and robots. China’s controls apply to all countries but were widely seen as retaliation to US President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Albanese said Australia would prioritise minerals that are key to its security, and that of its partners, including rare earths. But could his plan challenge China’s dominance? Rare earths are a group of 17 elements - named “rare” because they are notoriously difficult to extract and refine. Rare earths, like samarium and terbium, are critical to the production of technologies set to shape the world in the coming decades – including electric vehicles and highly advanced weapons systems. Albanese’s proposed reserve includes rare earths as well as other critical minerals of which Australia is a top producer - like lithium and cobalt. Both China and Australia have rare earth reserves. But 90% of rare earth refining – which makes them usable in technology – takes place in China, giving the country significant control over supply. And that has spooked Western governments. Beijing said its restrictions on rare earths were in response to Trump’s sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports to the US, currently at 145%. But analysts say Washington’s inability to secure the supply of rare earths has become one of the Trump administration’s chief anxieties, especially as diplomatic tensions with Beijing have deepened. Around 75% of US rare earth imports came from China between 2019 and 2022, according to the US Geological Survey. Philip Kirchlechner, director of Iron Ore Research in Perth, Western Australia, told the BBC that the US and EU had “dropped the ball” on recognising the importance of the rare earths over recent decades, as China swiftly developed a monopoly over refinement. “China has its foot on the blood vein… of US and European defence systems,” he added. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, this week said that China halting exports of rare earths used in advanced magnets was affecting the company’s ability to develop humanoid robots, in an early symbol of the pain Beijing has the power to inflict on US companies. Albanese’s proposal says that minerals in the reserve will be available to both “domestic industry and international partners”, in a likely reference to allies such as the US and EU. But Kirchlechner, while welcoming the move as “long overdue”, added that the proposal is “not going to solve the problem”. The fundamental issue is that even if Australia stockpiles more critical minerals, the refining process of rare earths will still largely be controlled by China. Lithium – not a rare earth, but a crucial metal in the production electric vehicle batteries and solar panels – is a good example. Australia mines 33% of the world’s lithium, but only refines and exports a tiny fraction. China, on the other hand, mines just 23% of the world’s lithium, but refines 57% of it, according to the International Energy Agency. Australia has been investing in refining rare earths as part of its Future Made in Australia plan, aimed at leveraging the country’s critical minerals reserves to drive the green transition. Arafura Rare Earths, headquartered in Perth, Western Australia, last year received A$840m in funding to create the country’s first combined mine and refinery for rare earths. And in November, Australia opened its first rare earths processing plant, also in Western Australia, operated by Lynas Rare Earths. But the country is expected to depend on China for refining until at least 2026, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, headquartered in Washington. China has been trying to seize on the volatility brought by Trump. In a series of editorials in Australian newspapers, China’s ambassador to Canberra lambasted Washington’s approach to global trade, and called on Australia to “join hands” with Beijing - something that Albanese quickly rejected. Australia has touted its resource industry in its talks with Trump. Some critical minerals were exempt from a 10% tariff he imposed on imports of most Australian products. But analysts say Albanese’s proposal is mainly aimed at protecting Australia and its partners from strategic adversaries like China. Alicia García-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis, told the BBC that Albanese’s plan was “more sophisticated” than previous proposals, because it included the ability to sell Australia’s resources at moments of economic tension. If China imposes export controls, she added, Australia could begin selling more of its mineral reserves to help lower prices on global markets, and loosen the control China has had on setting prices. But she said that Australia still cannot completely replace China. “If [Australia’s] goal is to serve the West, become more instrumental to the West – especially the US – there are weak spots China can enter – and the most important is refining. ” "

Around 75% of US rare earth imports came from China between 2019 and 2022, according to the US Geological Survey. Philip Kirchlechner, director of Iron Ore Research in Perth, Western Australia, told the BBC that the US and EU had “dropped the ball” on recognising the importance of the rare earths over recent decades, as China swiftly developed a monopoly over refinement. “China has its foot on the blood vein… of US and European defence systems,” he added. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, this week said that China halting exports of rare earths used in advanced magnets was affecting the company’s ability to develop humanoid robots, in an early symbol of the pain Beijing has the power to inflict on US companies. Albanese’s proposal says that minerals in the reserve will be available to both “domestic industry and international partners”, in a likely reference to allies such as the US and EU. But Kirchlechner, while welcoming the move as “long overdue”, added that the proposal is “not going to solve the problem”. The fundamental issue is that even if Australia stockpiles more critical minerals, the refining process of rare earths will still largely be controlled by China. Lithium – not a rare earth, but a crucial metal in the production electric vehicle batteries and solar panels – is a good example. Australia mines 33% of the world’s lithium, but only refines and exports a tiny fraction. China, on the other hand, mines just 23% of the world’s lithium, but refines 57% of it, according to the International Energy Agency. Australia has been investing in refining rare earths as part of its Future Made in Australia plan, aimed at leveraging the country’s critical minerals reserves to drive the green transition. Arafura Rare Earths, headquartered in Perth, Western Australia, last year received A$840m in funding to create the country’s first combined mine and refinery for rare earths. And in November, Australia opened its first rare earths processing plant, also in Western Australia, operated by Lynas Rare Earths. But the country is expected to depend on China for refining until at least 2026, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, headquartered in Washington. China has been trying to seize on the volatility brought by Trump. In a series of editorials in Australian newspapers, China’s ambassador to Canberra lambasted Washington’s approach to global trade, and called on Australia to “join hands” with Beijing - something that Albanese quickly rejected. Australia has touted its resource industry in its talks with Trump. Some critical minerals were exempt from a 10% tariff he imposed on imports of most Australian products. But analysts say Albanese’s proposal is mainly aimed at protecting Australia and its partners from strategic adversaries like China. Alicia García-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis, told the BBC that Albanese’s plan was “more sophisticated” than previous proposals, because it included the ability to sell Australia’s resources at moments of economic tension. If China imposes export controls, she added, Australia could begin selling more of its mineral reserves to help lower prices on global markets, and loosen the control China has had on setting prices. But she said that Australia still cannot completely replace China. “If [Australia’s] goal is to serve the West, become more instrumental to the West – especially the US – there are weak spots China can enter – and the most important is refining. ” "

    "body": "2025/04/25 - Here’s what you need to know: Australia’s prime minister Anthony Albanese has pledged to invest A$1. 2bn (£580m) in a strategic reserve for critical minerals if he wins next month’s election, as trade tensions escalate. The announcement came after China imposed export restrictions on seven rare earth elements, essential to the production of advanced technologies - including electric vehicles, fighter jets, and robots. China’s controls apply to all countries but were widely seen as retaliation to US President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Albanese said Australia would prioritise minerals that are key to its security, and that of its partners, including rare earths. But could his plan challenge China’s dominance? Rare earths are a group of 17 elements - named “rare” because they are notoriously difficult to extract and refine. Rare earths, like samarium and terbium, are critical to the production of technologies set to shape the world in the coming decades – including electric vehicles and highly advanced weapons systems. Albanese’s proposed reserve includes rare earths as well as other critical minerals of which Australia is a top producer - like lithium and cobalt. Both China and Australia have rare earth reserves. But 90% of rare earth refining – which makes them usable in technology – takes place in China, giving the country significant control over supply. And that has spooked Western governments.

    "body": "2025/04/25 - Let’s dive into the details: Ding Junhui (left) lost in the 2016 world final and Lei Peifan beat reigning world champion Kyren Wilson in the first round of this year’s tournament Players from eight countries have won snooker’s most prestigious title and become a world champion - but China is still waiting for its first success. Could 2025 be the year that changes? This season’s World Championship last 16 includes six Chinese players - Ding Junhui, Lei Peifan, Pang Junxu, Si Jiahui, Xiao Guodong and Zhao Xintong - with England having the next highest total with five. “This has got to be the biggest year for China in terms of chances of having a world champion,” said Jason Ferguson, chairman of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA). “We’ve seen players like Lei Peifan winning ranking events and players bounce on to the scene and that could happen here. These boys have no fear and really want it. “If a Chinese player became a world champion there’s no doubt that player would become a national hero. ” Trailblazer Ding has come the closest to snooker’s ultimate glory, losing 18-14 to Mark Selby in the 2016 final. Of the six Chinese players left in, four have won ranking tournaments, with two of those coming this season - Xiao at the Wuhan Open in October and Lei in the Scottish Open in December. “There’s been a big improvement in Chinese players,” said Ding. “In the past two or three seasons, they’ve improved so quickly. “They’re showing people how good they are and they’ve won tournaments, which says they’ve got the talent, skills and form to play anybody. “It tells people they’re ready to play the biggest tournament and hopefully one of them can win it. I would love to see a Chinese player win a World Championship - it would be great for Chinese snooker and also for the young ones to look at and start playing from a young age. ” Ding Junhui won the first of his 15 ranking titles just after his 18th birthday at the China Open in 2005 Since the turn of the century, there has been a British winner at the Crucible in every year apart from when Australian Neil Robertson triumphed in 2010 and Belgium’s Luca Brecel took the 2023 title. But a long-term aim from snooker bosses has been to grow the game globally. “Most people thought this sport was very English and would remain this way, but we could see a real burning will to grow in these countries,” said Ferguson. A pivotal moment in snooker’s development came when it was added into the World Games in Akita, Japan in August 2001. “That really changed the face of snooker,” added Ferguson. “I remember walking into the arena with my friends from Asia and we were carrying a banner in a stadium in front of 60,000 people which said ‘Billiards Sports’. “My friend said to me: ‘Jason, remember this day, this day is when snooker becomes a sport. ’ “We had taken this game which was doing well and very popular in England and had turned it into a sport. ” Snooker’s popularity in China grew at a rapid rate, accelerating when a shy Ding, two days after his 18th birthday, defeated seven-time world champion Stephen Hendry to win the 2005 China Open, watched by a reported television audience of 110 million people in the country. “Because of Ding, snooker now has a big market,” said world number 12 Zhang Anda. “Ding being world champion would be good for every player because China is a very big market. I hope he can win the first one. ” “It’s not just about major events in China, we’ve built Chinese snooker from the bottom up,” said Ferguson. “China embraced this sport and gave it a lot of love and care. The one thing China has got right is access to snooker facilities in schools and mainstream education. That’s something we need here. “The players are coming together in academies - there are three in Sheffield - and you find players playing against each other day in, day out and the standard of snooker is absolutely amazing. ” Chinese snooker, and the sport in general, received a huge setback in June 2023 when 10 players from China received bans for their involvement in match-fixing. Former Masters champion Yan Bingtao was among those banned, while Liang Wenbo and Li Hang were handed lifetime bans. Zhao, a former UK Championship winner, served a 20-month ban and has been the only player to return after he had not directly thrown a match but accepted charges of being a party to another player fixing two matches and betting on matches himself. “It was a shame some players fell foul of the rules, it was a really sad time and difficult to deal with,” said Ferguson. “We kept close to our partners in China and the authorities in snooker. We worked together to educate players better and to ensure the players have opportunities. The sport has recovered and it has not stopped the talent coming through. ” Halo World Snooker Championship 19 April to 5 May Crucible Theatre, Sheffield Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Sport website and app; live text coverage of selected matches; updates on BBC Radio 5 Live Pang Junxu beat compatriot Zhang Anda in the first round this year and will play Ronnie O’Sullivan in the last 16 Robertson knows what it is like to break through the British dominance of snooker and felt the unity the Chinese players were showing this year was a massive boost. The Australian added: “Xiao Guodong said it’s like ‘Team China’ and they are really happy for each other and I like that mindset. He said they’re trying to take the burden off Ding and support him and they’re in it together. “The game is getting stronger and stronger in China and it makes first rounds in all tournaments harder as we’re only going to get more Chinese players qualifying. “They don’t seem fazed by the Crucible and all seem to play well, even on debuts, so it’s exciting for snooker. We’re seeing a lot of international flags, which is great for the game. ” So what happens to snooker if a Chinese player lifts the famous trophy on Monday, 5 May? “It’s something the authorities we’ve been working in China with have dreamed of, that one day they would have the world champion,” said Ferguson. “If a Chinese player wins it would be magical, a historical moment, a real shift in the sport, and I can’t tell you the media frenzy it would cause for snooker around the world. ” "

    "body": "2025/04/25 - Experts revealed that Lindsey Burrow is running the London Marathon to continue raising money for charity in memory of late husband Rob Lindsey Burrow says her late husband Rob “will be with me throughout” when she runs the London Marathon on Sunday. Mother-of-three Burrow, 42, is running in memory of former rugby league great Rob, who died in June 2024 after being diagnosed with motor neurone disease (MND) in 2019. She will also run the Rob Burrow Leeds Marathon two weeks later to continue raising money for the Leeds Rhinos Foundation and Leeds Hospitals Charity. “He will be in spirit with me throughout the whole run, in my head saying ‘come on run faster, you can do this’,” Burrow told BBC Yorkshire. “As I lace up my trainers I’ll definitely be thinking of Rob and the MND community. That is ultimately why I am running the race, to make Rob proud. ” Rob’s MND diagnosis came two years after he retired from a stellar 17-year career at Leeds Rhinos, during which he made almost 500 appearances and won 13 trophies. With the help of former team-mate and close friend Kevin Sinfield, they raised more than Â£15 million for MND charities as Rob battled the disease himself. Both men were awarded CBEs in the 2024 New Year Honours. “Rob will will be at the forefront of my mind. It will be emotional but I’m looking forward to it,” said Burrow, who will run the 26. 2 miles alongside her brother Mark. ‘Our daughters will be with us,’ say dads of Southport victims running London Marathon ‘Once a fool to become an expert’ - Yee set for marathon debut London Marathon 2025 - everything you need to know The official charity of the year for the 45th edition of the London Marathon is Pancreatic Cancer UK. Pancreatic Cancer is the deadliest common cancer - more than half of people in the UK who are diagnosed die within just three months. Thousands of people will be running and raising money for the charity, which is aiming to collect Â£2m to provide vital early detection tests. Earlier in April, 797 pairs of running shoes, donated by survivors, supporters and families affected by pancreatic cancer, were displayed on the banks of the River Thames in London. Among those running on Sunday will be Jo Curtis, who lost her husband, Stewart, to pancreatic cancer. Stewart, who had been training for the marathon when he was diagnosed, underwent successful surgery but the cancer returned a year later. “A key thing for me has been that we can’t have gone through this for no positive to come from it. I kept thinking, ‘What can I do?’ There was a lightbulb moment where I thought, ‘I can do the marathon for him’,” Curtis told BBC Sport. “My hope is that collectively all of us who are doing it on the day raise a significant amount of awareness for the charity, hopefully a huge amount of money, and that can prolong the life of a dad, a mum, a sister and allow them more time with their family. ” London Marathon Sunday, 27 April from 08:30 BST Watch on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app West Brom fan Dave Heeley will be raising money for the club’s Albion Foundation “Stubborn to a fault… A lot of grit and determination… Just dad”. That’s how Dave Heeley’s daughters Grace, Georgie-Lee and Dannie describe their father as they prepare to join him for his 17th and final London Marathon. Widely known as ‘Blind Dave’, the 67-year-old from West Bromwich first ran the London Marathon in 2002 and has embarked on several extraordinary physical challenges to raise money for charity despite being diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa at the age of 10. Among his achievements, Heeley became the first blind person to run seven marathons across seven continents in seven days in 2008. In 2011, he ran the length of the UK, completing 10 marathons in 10 days from John O’Groats to Land’s End. “I asked the question, ‘Why me? What have I done to deserve this?’ Then I went on a bit of a journey and thought, ‘You know what kid, life is for living’. Let’s go out there and enjoy it,” Heeley told BBC Sport. “Don’t worry about what you cannot do. Concentrate your efforts on what you can do and you will achieve. ” Heeley, raising money for his club West Brom’s Albion Foundation, said running with his daughters on Sunday will be “the best memory of all” after they persuaded him to run one last London Marathon having undergone two knee replacements. Run With Rom and his epic Marathon Mix Romesh Ranganathan picks the tunes to help get you over the finish line Flora Turnbull will continue to spread awareness of prostate cancer after losing her father, former BBC Breakfast presenter Bill Turnbull, to the disease in 2022. The number of prostate cancer referrals within the NHS reached a record high a year after Bill’s death, following his work to raise awareness of the disease. His diagnosis coincided with that of actor Stephen Fry, with their willingness to speak about prostate cancer termed the ‘Turnbull and Fry effect’ by NHS England. On continuing the legacy of her father by running the marathon for Prostate Cancer UK, Turnbull, 33, said: “After his death, we as a family were overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and thanks from people across the nation, and particularly those men who were inspired to learn more about their own prostate cancer risk and speak to their GP. “But there is still work to be done. I want to ensure that everyone can keep their dads, partners, brothers, sons, grandads, uncles and friends around as long as possible. ” "

    "body": "2025/04/25 - Let’s dive into the details: Lindsey Burrow is running the London Marathon to continue raising money for charity in memory of late husband Rob Lindsey Burrow says her late husband Rob “will be with me throughout” when she runs the London Marathon on Sunday. Mother-of-three Burrow, 42, is running in memory of former rugby league great Rob, who died in June 2024 after being diagnosed with motor neurone disease (MND) in 2019. She will also run the Rob Burrow Leeds Marathon two weeks later to continue raising money for the Leeds Rhinos Foundation and Leeds Hospitals Charity. “He will be in spirit with me throughout the whole run, in my head saying ‘come on run faster, you can do this’,” Burrow told BBC Yorkshire. “As I lace up my trainers I’ll definitely be thinking of Rob and the MND community. That is ultimately why I am running the race, to make Rob proud. ” Rob’s MND diagnosis came two years after he retired from a stellar 17-year career at Leeds Rhinos, during which he made almost 500 appearances and won 13 trophies. With the help of former team-mate and close friend Kevin Sinfield, they raised more than Â£15 million for MND charities as Rob battled the disease himself. Both men were awarded CBEs in the 2024 New Year Honours. “Rob will will be at the forefront of my mind. It will be emotional but I’m looking forward to it,” said Burrow, who will run the 26. 2 miles alongside her brother Mark. ‘Our daughters will be with us,’ say dads of Southport victims running London Marathon ‘Once a fool to become an expert’ - Yee set for marathon debut London Marathon 2025 - everything you need to know The official charity of the year for the 45th edition of the London Marathon is Pancreatic Cancer UK. Pancreatic Cancer is the deadliest common cancer - more than half of people in the UK who are diagnosed die within just three months. Thousands of people will be running and raising money for the charity, which is aiming to collect Â£2m to provide vital early detection tests. Earlier in April, 797 pairs of running shoes, donated by survivors, supporters and families affected by pancreatic cancer, were displayed on the banks of the River Thames in London. Among those running on Sunday will be Jo Curtis, who lost her husband, Stewart, to pancreatic cancer. Stewart, who had been training for the marathon when he was diagnosed, underwent successful surgery but the cancer returned a year later. “A key thing for me has been that we can’t have gone through this for no positive to come from it. I kept thinking, ‘What can I do?’ There was a lightbulb moment where I thought, ‘I can do the marathon for him’,” Curtis told BBC Sport. “My hope is that collectively all of us who are doing it on the day raise a significant amount of awareness for the charity, hopefully a huge amount of money, and that can prolong the life of a dad, a mum, a sister and allow them more time with their family. ” London Marathon Sunday, 27 April from 08:30 BST Watch on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app West Brom fan Dave Heeley will be raising money for the club’s Albion Foundation “Stubborn to a fault… A lot of grit and determination… Just dad”. That’s how Dave Heeley’s daughters Grace, Georgie-Lee and Dannie describe their father as they prepare to join him for his 17th and final London Marathon. Widely known as ‘Blind Dave’, the 67-year-old from West Bromwich first ran the London Marathon in 2002 and has embarked on several extraordinary physical challenges to raise money for charity despite being diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa at the age of 10. Among his achievements, Heeley became the first blind person to run seven marathons across seven continents in seven days in 2008. In 2011, he ran the length of the UK, completing 10 marathons in 10 days from John O’Groats to Land’s End. “I asked the question, ‘Why me? What have I done to deserve this?’ Then I went on a bit of a journey and thought, ‘You know what kid, life is for living’. Let’s go out there and enjoy it,” Heeley told BBC Sport. “Don’t worry about what you cannot do. Concentrate your efforts on what you can do and you will achieve. ” Heeley, raising money for his club West Brom’s Albion Foundation, said running with his daughters on Sunday will be “the best memory of all” after they persuaded him to run one last London Marathon having undergone two knee replacements. Run With Rom and his epic Marathon Mix Romesh Ranganathan picks the tunes to help get you over the finish line Flora Turnbull will continue to spread awareness of prostate cancer after losing her father, former BBC Breakfast presenter Bill Turnbull, to the disease in 2022. The number of prostate cancer referrals within the NHS reached a record high a year after Bill’s death, following his work to raise awareness of the disease. His diagnosis coincided with that of actor Stephen Fry, with their willingness to speak about prostate cancer termed the ‘Turnbull and Fry effect’ by NHS England. On continuing the legacy of her father by running the marathon for Prostate Cancer UK, Turnbull, 33, said: “After his death, we as a family were overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and thanks from people across the nation, and particularly those men who were inspired to learn more about their own prostate cancer risk and speak to their GP. “But there is still work to be done. I want to ensure that everyone can keep their dads, partners, brothers, sons, grandads, uncles and friends around as long as possible. ” "

Julie Sarahs launched a pop-up branch, called Stroud Community Costumes, which allows students to borrow dresses, suits, shoes and bags for a non-compulsory donation. She was inspired to take action after seeing the cost of some dresses rise to more than £200. “If I can take away a little bit of the stress around this time when people are revising for exams, perhaps struggling financially or wanting to be a little bit sustainable with fashion then this is perfect for them,” Ms Sarahs said.

Ms Sarahs said she was worried some students felt priced out of attending the event. “If I can help by providing somebody with something to wear then that is great,” she said. “That frees up a little bit more time and money for them to go wild on hair, makeup, nails, accessories, fake tans, or [I can] try and reassure them that, actually, it doesn’t have to be so over the top. ” Ms Sarahs added she would be “very grateful” for donations of shirts, suits and men’s shoes for male students, as she does not have as many options for boys.

    "title": "Update: Why the Post Office paid £600m to stay shackled to the faulty Horizon system",
    "body": "2025/04/25 - It has been recently reported that The Post Office has paid more than £600m of public money to continue using the faulty Horizon IT system despite deciding to ditch it more than a decade ago, the BBC can reveal. The terms of the original 1999 deal with computer giant Fujitsu mean the Post Office has been stuck with the system and unable to build a replacement so far, even after it contributed to one of the UK’s biggest miscarriages of justice. Former Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair and other senior Labour government figures were warned about potential problems with the terms of the deal before it was signed, the BBC has learned. The Post Office said it “apologises unreservedly to victims of the Horizon IT scandal” and said it was committed to moving away from Fujitsu and the Horizon software. Under the terms of the original £548m deal, struck under pressure from the then-Labour government, the Post Office did not own the computer code for the core part of the Horizon system. Although the Post Office has wanted to switch suppliers since 2012, buying the rights to the code from Fujitsu or building a completely new system from scratch was considered too expensive - even as the amounts paid to Fujitsu to retain the Horizon system grew and grew. Because it did not own the code, the Post Office was also unable to inspect the part of the software that processed transactions, and had to rely on assurances from Fujitsu that it was functioning correctly. The Post Office, which is owned by the government, prosecuted about 700 sub-postmasters between 1999 and 2015 for theft, fraud and false accounting over supposed cash shortfalls in branches reported by the Horizon system, based on these assurances. The convictions were overturned by Parliament last year. Earlier this year, Business Minister Baroness Jones of Whitchurch told the House of Lords that the Post Office is “unfortunately, still dependent on the Horizon system”, and the only way Fujitsu could be “out of the picture” immediately would mean shutting down all local post offices. An attempt to replace the system with one built by IBM failed in 2016, at a cost of £40m, and the Post Office extended its contract with Fujitsu for at least four more years at a cost of £107m. The Post Office told the BBC that it finally obtained rights related to the Horizon software and code in 2023, although it is not known if this includes the core system that processes transactions. The £10m price for the licence was “cheap - because who else would buy it?” according to IT expert Jason Coyne, one of the first people to identify flaws in the system. The BBC understands that the Post Office may try to use this licence for Horizon’s replacement. But while this is being built, IT experts believe the Post Office’s contract with Fujitsu will need to be extended beyond March 2026 - when it is currently due to end. Issues over who would own the Horizon software began when the contract to computerise the network of Post Office branches - then numbering 18,000 - was negotiated between the Post Office, Fujitsu and its subsidiary ICL Pathway, and the government. In May 1999, Sir Tony Blair received an update from the Treasury, in a document warning that discussions with ICL over the terms of a deal “have foundered”. One of the sticking points was around intellectual property rights (IPR) - which included ownership of the code within the Horizon software. The document says that ICL was “not prepared to… give perpetual licences for all the IPR”. It goes on to say that if the Post Office ever wanted to change suppliers, the owner of the IPR “would be in a strong position to drive a costly settlement with the Post Office”. The BBC has also obtained a document from 20 May the same year, which was sent to then-Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown and other government officials, warning about the issue of who owned the code. In it, a Treasury civil servant states that one of the “main problems” with the terms of a proposed deal with ICL for the Horizon software was the “issues surrounding ownership of assets and IPR of the kit acquired by” the Post Office. Mr Coyne, the IT expert, said it was “utter madness” that the deal went ahead in July 1999 because it meant that the Post Office became “operationally reliant on Horizon”, even though it did not own the rights to use the system without Fujitsu. A spokesperson for Sir Tony Blair did not address the BBC’s questions around his knowledge of the IPR issues but said he “took very seriously the issues raised about the Horizon contract” at the time. “The final decision was taken after an investigation by an independent panel recommended it was viable. “It is now clear that the Horizon product was seriously flawed, leading to tragic and completely unacceptable consequences, and Mr Blair has deep sympathy with all those affected. ” A spokesperson for Gordon Brown said he “would not have been shown the memo” from 20 May 1999 and he would have been copied in as a “formality”. “He was not involved in any work related to the purchasing, award or management of the Horizon contract. ” The warnings about ownership of the IPR came true more than a decade later when Post Office decided to invite other companies to take over the Horizon contract. Former executives told the Post Office Inquiry, which is examining decisions leading up to the wrongful convictions of hundreds of sub-postmasters, how the company had found it difficult to replace Fujitsu. Alisdair Cameron, former chief financial officer at the Post Office, said that Fujitsu had been “difficult colleagues” and “it was accepted that Horizon, and the infrastructure on which it was built, was vulnerable”. But Mike Young, chief operations officer at the Post Office between October 2010 and April 2012, told the inquiry that Fujitsu management said to him “the code is ours. You own the service because you pay for that but you don’t pay [for] the code”. Documents released by the Post Office Inquiry show the “IPR issue” was often discussed by top-level Post Office executives. “There is a risk that we may be unable to agree an IP license with Fujitsu on reasonable terms”, said an agenda for a Post Office board meeting in July 2013 - while other documents describe concerns over costs. Procurement specialist Ian Makgill told us he believes not owning the IPR to the Horizon software would have been a factor in the collapse of the 2016 IBM deal to replace the system. He said that if IBM had tried to build new software without any of the IPR from Horizon, it would have needed to “start from scratch, which would have cost the Post Office hundreds of millions of pounds”. “IPR is the reason why the Post Office hasn’t been able to move away from Fujitsu and the Horizon software,” he said. Since 1999, the Post Office has spent £2. 5bn on contracts with Fujitsu. This figure includes more than £600m spent on bridging or extension contracts to continue the Horizon contract since the Post Office started looking for new suppliers in 2012, according to analysis from data firm Tussell and the BBC. Many of the sub-postmasters wrongly accused by the Post Office maintained that there was no missing money and the shortfalls were down to errors in the Horizon system. But with the Post Office unable to directly inspect the system which processed transactions, it accepted assurances from Fujitsu that the system was working correctly. “Fujitsu were fighting the whole time to protect their investment and their intellectual property, rather than looking after the interests of the sub-postmasters,” said Mr Makgill. Fujitsu did not respond to the BBC’s specific questions but stated that it was “focused on supporting the Post Office in their plans for a new service delivery model” so branches can continue to operate. Mr Makgill said that the Post Office bears the “ultimate responsibility” over the fate of wrongly accused sub-postmasters. “They didn’t have to take those prosecutions, they didn’t have to take people to court. ” Sub-postmasters currently using the Horizon IT software continue to report issues with it. Seven in 10 said they had experienced an “unexplained discrepancy” on the system since January 2020, according to a YouGov survey with 1,015 respondents commissioned by the Post Office Inquiry in 2024. The Post Office has said that it has not undertaken any prosecutions related to Horizon since 2015 and “has no intention of doing so”. It told the BBC that it is “implementing changes across the entire organisation” so that it is “fit for the future, fundamentally changed and with postmasters at its heart”. It said this includes working with Fujitsu to correct discrepancies and reviewing the current version of Horizon - replacing it in stages, under a five-year plan named the “Future Technology Portfolio”. Post Office chairman Nigel Railton has said a new IT system would not be introduced in one “big bang” but there would be gradual changes. The Post Office did not respond to the BBC’s specific questions about IPR being the reason why the company was unable to ditch Fujitsu, and said it would not be appropriate to comment ahead of the Post Office Inquiry’s final report. The Department of Business and Trade told the BBC that it was providing £136m of funding over the next five years to the Future Technology Portfolio, and was “working at pace” to ensure the Post Office had the technology it needed, including replacing the Horizon system.

But with the Post Office unable to directly inspect the system which processed transactions, it accepted assurances from Fujitsu that the system was working correctly. “Fujitsu were fighting the whole time to protect their investment and their intellectual property, rather than looking after the interests of the sub-postmasters,” said Mr Makgill. Fujitsu did not respond to the BBC’s specific questions but stated that it was “focused on supporting the Post Office in their plans for a new service delivery model” so branches can continue to operate. Mr Makgill said that the Post Office bears the “ultimate responsibility” over the fate of wrongly accused sub-postmasters. “They didn’t have to take those prosecutions, they didn’t have to take people to court. ” Sub-postmasters currently using the Horizon IT software continue to report issues with it. Seven in 10 said they had experienced an “unexplained discrepancy” on the system since January 2020, according to a YouGov survey with 1,015 respondents commissioned by the Post Office Inquiry in 2024. The Post Office has said that it has not undertaken any prosecutions related to Horizon since 2015 and “has no intention of doing so”. It told the BBC that it is “implementing changes across the entire organisation” so that it is “fit for the future, fundamentally changed and with postmasters at its heart”. It said this includes working with Fujitsu to correct discrepancies and reviewing the current version of Horizon - replacing it in stages, under a five-year plan named the “Future Technology Portfolio”. Post Office chairman Nigel Railton has said a new IT system would not be introduced in one “big bang” but there would be gradual changes. The Post Office did not respond to the BBC’s specific questions about IPR being the reason why the company was unable to ditch Fujitsu, and said it would not be appropriate to comment ahead of the Post Office Inquiry’s final report. The Department of Business and Trade told the BBC that it was providing £136m of funding over the next five years to the Future Technology Portfolio, and was “working at pace” to ensure the Post Office had the technology it needed, including replacing the Horizon system.

    "title": "Update: California passes Japan as fourth largest economy",
    "body": "2025/04/25 - It has been recently reported that California’s economy has overtaken that of the country of Japan, making the US state the fourth largest global economic force. Governor Gavin Newsom touted new data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the US Bureau of Economic Analysis showing California’s growth. The data shows California’s gross domestic product (GDP) hit $4. 10 trillion (£3. 08 trillion) in 2024, surpassing Japan, which was marked at $4. 01 trillion. The state now only trails Germany, China and the US as a whole. “California isn’t just keeping pace with the world - we’re setting the pace,” Newsom said. The new figures come as Newsom has spoken out against President Donald Trump’s tariffs and voiced concern about the future of the state’s economy. California has the largest share of manufacturing and agricultural production in the US. It is also home to leading technological innovation, the centre of the world’s entertainment industry and the country’s two largest seaports. Newsom, a prominent Democrat and possible presidential candidate in 2028, filed a lawsuit challenging Trump’s authority to impose the levies, which have caused disruption to global markets and trade. Trump has enacted 10% levies on almost all countries importing to the US, after announcing a 90-day pause on higher tariffs. Another 25% tariff was imposed on Mexico and Canada. The levies on China, however, have led to an all-out trade war with the world’s second largest economy. Trump imposed import taxes of up to 145% on Chinese goods coming into the US and China hit back with a 125% tax on American products. His administration said last week that when the new tariffs were added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%. Newsom noted his worries about the future of the state’s economy. “While we celebrate this success, we recognise that our progress is threatened by the reckless tariff policies of the current federal administration,” he said. “California’s economy powers the nation, and it must be protected. ” Trump has argued his trade war is only levelling the playing field after years of the US being taken advantage of. The tariffs are an effort to encourage factories and jobs to return to the US. It is one major pillar of his economic agenda, as is a cut in interest rates, aimed at reducing the cost of borrowing for Americans. The new data shows California’s GDP behind the US at $29. 18 trillion, China at $18. 74 trillion and Germany at $4. 65 trillion. It also shows California was the fastest growing among those countries. Japan’s economy is under pressure because of its decreasing and ageing population, which means its workforce is shrinking and social care costs are ballooning. This week, the IMF cut its economic growth forecast for Japan and projected that the central bank would raise interest rates more slowly than previously expected because of the impact of higher tariffs. “The effect of tariffs announced on April 2 and associated uncertainty offset the expected strengthening of private consumption with above-inflation wage growth boosting household disposable income,” its World Economic Outlook report said.

    "title": "Update: Supported housing in crisis, groups tell Starmer",
    "body": "2025/04/25 - According to new developments, Supported housing, which helps vulnerable or disabled people live independently, is in crisis, an open letter signed by more than 170 organisations in the sector claims. Services at one in three providers in England had to shut last year, adding to a total shortfall of about 325,000 places, says the letter, which will be delivered to Prime Minister Keir Starmer today. Signatories to it include Refuge, Age UK and the National Housing Federation (NHF). Blaming cuts to council funding and rising costs, the NHF says a further one in three providers fear they may close unless the government pledges more money. The government says supported housing is vital and it is focused on building more homes. About half a million people in the UK currently live in supported housing, including young care leavers, army veterans, people with learning disabilities and those escaping homelessness or domestic abuse. “Supported housing plays an indispensable role in cutting NHS waiting list backlogs, and reducing pressure on social care, temporary accommodation, and other vital public services,” the open letter says. However, it says the future of supported housing is now at risk following “years of funding cuts” and that local authorities have now been forced to “decommission vital services”. “Rising costs alongside reduced funding have rendered many services unviable, forcing many to close, while demand for supported housing continues to rise. The decision to increase employers’ National Insurance contributions has placed even further pressure on providers’ budgets. ” The organisations are calling for long-term increased funding for housing-related support of at least £1. 6bn per year for councils and for supported homes to be among the 1. 5 million new houses planned by the government. “We recognise the vital role played by supported housing in helping vulnerable people to live independently and well, and the contribution it makes to tackling rough sleeping and timely hospital discharge,” a spokesperson for the Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government said. The spokesperson said the government was putting £2bn into increasing social and affordable housebuilding in 2026-27, with further details to be set out in a long-term housing strategy later this year. Proponents of austerity measures say tough funding choices need to be made to balance the UK’s finances. However, Shaoxiong Liu says his family do not know what they would have done without a supported housing place for his son Jason. Aged 39, Jason has autism, a learning disability and mental health challenges. As he grew older, this became increasingly unmanageable for his family. After falling ill, Jason was admitted to hospital with sepsis in 2017. Due to his challenging behaviour and a condition that induces severe vomiting, he remained in hospital for months as they struggled to find somewhere long term that could accommodate his needs. He was eventually placed with Advance Housing, where his family says Jason has flourished in the intervening eight years. His weight has risen from 35kg to 53kg, he can go on bus trips and attends social events organised by the housing provider. “Jason’s behaviour is so much better now. He’s lived there so long and he’s happy there,” Mr Liu says. “Jason is an adult now and we are in our 70s, so his behaviour could be quite dangerous for us if he lived with us - we couldn’t look after him. ” The NHF says one in three providers in England it surveyed say they may have to stop providing services altogether, meaning the loss of 70,000 supported homes across the country. In 2009, ringfenced council funding for housing-related support was removed. When council budgets were cut during austerity from 2010, funding was needed in other areas, meaning some councils had to cut supported housing services. The NHF says that means there are now fewer supported homes than in 2007, including a net loss of 3,000 supported homes in the last three years. It calculates there is a total shortfall of up to 325,000 supported homes, based on unmet need.

    "title": "Latest: Who will win the race to develop a humanoid robot?",
    "body": "2025/04/24 - Let’s dive into the details: It’s a bright spring morning in Hanover, Germany, and I’m on my way to meet a robot. I have been invited to see the G1, a humanoid robot built by Chinese firm, Unitree, at the Hannover Messe, one of the world’s largest industrial trade shows. Standing at about 4’3” (130cm), G1 is smaller and more affordable than other humanoid robots on the market, and has such a highly fluid range of motion and dexterity that videos of it performing dance numbers and martial arts have gone viral. Today the G1 is being controlled remotely by Pedro Zheng, the Unitree sales manager. He explains that customers must program each G1 for autonomous functions. Passers-by stop and actively try to engage with the G1, which cannot be said for a lot of the other machines being shown off in the cavernous conference room. They reach out to shake its hand, make sudden movements to see if it will respond, they laugh when G1 waves or bends backwards, they apologise if they bump into it. There’s something about its human shape that, uncanny as it is, sets people at ease. Unitree is just one of dozens of companies around the world developing robots that have a human form. The potential is huge - for business it promises a workforce that doesn’t need holidays or pay rises. It could also be the ultimate domestic appliance. After all, who wouldn’t want a machine that could do the laundry and stack the dishwasher. But the technology is still some way off. While robotic arms and mobile robots have been common in factories and warehouses for decades, conditions in those workplaces can be controlled and workers can be kept safe. Introducing a humanoid robot to a less predictable environment, like a restaurant or a home, is a much more difficult problem. To be useful humanoid robots would have to be strong, but that also makes them potentially dangerous - simply falling over at the wrong time could be hazardous. So much work needs to be done on the artificial intelligence that would control such a machine. “The AI simply has not yet reached a breakthrough moment,” a Unitree spokesperson tells the BBC. “Today’s robot AI finds basic logic and reasoning – such as for understanding and completing complex tasks in a logical way – a challenge,” they said. At the moment their G1 is marketed at research institutions and tech companies, who can use Unitree’s open source software for development. For now entrepreneurs are focussing their efforts on humanoid robots for warehouses and factories. The highest profile of those is Elon Musk. His car company, Tesla, is developing a humanoid robot called Optimus. In January he said that “several thousand” will be built this year and he expects them to be doing “useful things” in Tesla factories. Other carmakers are following a similar path. BMW recently introduced humanoid robots to a US factory. Meanwhile, South Korean car firm Hyundai has ordered tens of thousands of robots from Boston Dynamics, the robot firm it bought in 2021. Thomas Andersson, founder of research firm STIQ, tracks 49 companies developing humanoid robots - those with two arms and legs. If you broaden the definition to robots with two arms, but propel themselves on wheels, then he looks at more than 100 firms. Mr Andersson thinks that Chinese companies are likely to dominate the market. “The supply chain and the entire ecosystem for robotics is huge in China, and it’s really easy to iterate developments and do R&amp;D [research and development],” he says. Unitree underlines that advantage - its G1 is cheap (for a robot) with an advertised price of $16,000 (£12,500). Also, Mr Andersson points out, the investment favours Asian nations. In a recent report STIQ notes that almost 60% of all funding for humanoid robots has been raised in Asia, with the US attracting most of the rest. Chinese companies have the added benefit of support from the national and local government. For example, in Shanghai there is a state-backed training facility for robots, where dozens of humanoid robots are learning to complete tasks. So how can US and European robot makers compete with that? Bristol-based Bren Pierce has founded three robotics companies and the latest, Kinisi has just launched the KR1 robot. While the robot has been designed and developed in the UK, it will be manufactured in Asia. “The problem you get as a European or American company, you have to buy all these sub-components from China in the first place. “So then it becomes stupid to buy your motors, buy your batteries, buy your resistors, shift them all halfway around the world to put together when you could just put them all together at the source, which is in Asia. ” As well as making his robots in Asia, Mr Pierce is keeping costs down by not going for the full humanoid form. Designed for warehouses and factories, the KR1 does not have legs. “All of these places have flat floors. Why would you want the added expense of a very complex form factor… when you could just put it on a mobile base?” he asks. Where possible, his KR1 is built with mass-produced components - the wheels are the same as you would find on an electric scooter. “My philosophy is buy as many things as you can off the shelf. So all our motors, batteries, computers, cameras, they’re all commercially available, mass produced parts,” he says. Like his competitors at Unitree, Mr Pierce says that the real “secret sauce” is the software that allows the robot to work with humans. “A lot of companies come out with very high-tech robots, but then you start needing a PhD in robotics to be able to actually install it and use it. “What we’re trying to design is a very simple to use robot where your average warehouse or factory worker can actually learn how to use it in a couple of hours,” Mr Pierce says. He says the KR1 can perform a task after being guided through it by a human 20 or 30 times. The KR1 will be given to pilot customers to test this year. So will robots ever break out of factories into the home? Even the optimistic Mr Pierce says it’s a long way off. “My long term dream for the last 20 years has been building the everything robot. This is what I was doing my PhD work in I do think that is the end goal, but it’s a very complicated task,” says Mr Pierce. “I still think eventually they will be there, but I think that’s at least 10 to 15 years away. ” "

He says the KR1 can perform a task after being guided through it by a human 20 or 30 times. The KR1 will be given to pilot customers to test this year. So will robots ever break out of factories into the home? Even the optimistic Mr Pierce says it’s a long way off. “My long term dream for the last 20 years has been building the everything robot. This is what I was doing my PhD work in I do think that is the end goal, but it’s a very complicated task,” says Mr Pierce. “I still think eventually they will be there, but I think that’s at least 10 to 15 years away. ” "

    "title": "Big News: Who will win the race to develop a humanoid robot?",
    "body": "2025/04/24 - It has been recently reported that It’s a bright spring morning in Hanover, Germany, and I’m on my way to meet a robot. I have been invited to see the G1, a humanoid robot built by Chinese firm, Unitree, at the Hannover Messe, one of the world’s largest industrial trade shows. Standing at about 4’3” (130cm), G1 is smaller and more affordable than other humanoid robots on the market, and has such a highly fluid range of motion and dexterity that videos of it performing dance numbers and martial arts have gone viral. Today the G1 is being controlled remotely by Pedro Zheng, the Unitree sales manager. He explains that customers must program each G1 for autonomous functions. Passers-by stop and actively try to engage with the G1, which cannot be said for a lot of the other machines being shown off in the cavernous conference room. They reach out to shake its hand, make sudden movements to see if it will respond, they laugh when G1 waves or bends backwards, they apologise if they bump into it. There’s something about its human shape that, uncanny as it is, sets people at ease. Unitree is just one of dozens of companies around the world developing robots that have a human form. The potential is huge - for business it promises a workforce that doesn’t need holidays or pay rises. It could also be the ultimate domestic appliance. After all, who wouldn’t want a machine that could do the laundry and stack the dishwasher. But the technology is still some way off. While robotic arms and mobile robots have been common in factories and warehouses for decades, conditions in those workplaces can be controlled and workers can be kept safe. Introducing a humanoid robot to a less predictable environment, like a restaurant or a home, is a much more difficult problem. To be useful humanoid robots would have to be strong, but that also makes them potentially dangerous - simply falling over at the wrong time could be hazardous. So much work needs to be done on the artificial intelligence that would control such a machine. “The AI simply has not yet reached a breakthrough moment,” a Unitree spokesperson tells the BBC. “Today’s robot AI finds basic logic and reasoning – such as for understanding and completing complex tasks in a logical way – a challenge,” they said. At the moment their G1 is marketed at research institutions and tech companies, who can use Unitree’s open source software for development. For now entrepreneurs are focussing their efforts on humanoid robots for warehouses and factories. The highest profile of those is Elon Musk. His car company, Tesla, is developing a humanoid robot called Optimus. In January he said that “several thousand” will be built this year and he expects them to be doing “useful things” in Tesla factories. Other carmakers are following a similar path. BMW recently introduced humanoid robots to a US factory. Meanwhile, South Korean car firm Hyundai has ordered tens of thousands of robots from Boston Dynamics, the robot firm it bought in 2021. Thomas Andersson, founder of research firm STIQ, tracks 49 companies developing humanoid robots - those with two arms and legs. If you broaden the definition to robots with two arms, but propel themselves on wheels, then he looks at more than 100 firms. Mr Andersson thinks that Chinese companies are likely to dominate the market. “The supply chain and the entire ecosystem for robotics is huge in China, and it’s really easy to iterate developments and do R&amp;D [research and development],” he says. Unitree underlines that advantage - its G1 is cheap (for a robot) with an advertised price of $16,000 (£12,500). Also, Mr Andersson points out, the investment favours Asian nations. In a recent report STIQ notes that almost 60% of all funding for humanoid robots has been raised in Asia, with the US attracting most of the rest. Chinese companies have the added benefit of support from the national and local government. For example, in Shanghai there is a state-backed training facility for robots, where dozens of humanoid robots are learning to complete tasks. So how can US and European robot makers compete with that? Bristol-based Bren Pierce has founded three robotics companies and the latest, Kinisi has just launched the KR1 robot. While the robot has been designed and developed in the UK, it will be manufactured in Asia. “The problem you get as a European or American company, you have to buy all these sub-components from China in the first place. “So then it becomes stupid to buy your motors, buy your batteries, buy your resistors, shift them all halfway around the world to put together when you could just put them all together at the source, which is in Asia. ” As well as making his robots in Asia, Mr Pierce is keeping costs down by not going for the full humanoid form. Designed for warehouses and factories, the KR1 does not have legs. “All of these places have flat floors. Why would you want the added expense of a very complex form factor… when you could just put it on a mobile base?” he asks. Where possible, his KR1 is built with mass-produced components - the wheels are the same as you would find on an electric scooter. “My philosophy is buy as many things as you can off the shelf. So all our motors, batteries, computers, cameras, they’re all commercially available, mass produced parts,” he says. Like his competitors at Unitree, Mr Pierce says that the real “secret sauce” is the software that allows the robot to work with humans. “A lot of companies come out with very high-tech robots, but then you start needing a PhD in robotics to be able to actually install it and use it. “What we’re trying to design is a very simple to use robot where your average warehouse or factory worker can actually learn how to use it in a couple of hours,” Mr Pierce says.

    "body": "2025/04/24 - Experts revealed that M&amp;S shoppers are facing further frustration at the checkout as the company struggles to recover from a cyber attack. Customers began reporting problems on the weekend, with the retailer confirming on Tuesday it was dealing with a “cyber incident. ” It told the BBC on Wednesday that customer-facing systems were back to normal. However, it has since confirmed it has been forced to take some systems offline as part of its “proactive management of the incident. ” It said it had stopped processing contactless payments, had paused the collection of click and collect orders in stores, and warned of delays to online order deliveries. Contactless payments have since been restored, the BBC has been told, however this has been questioned by some customers. BBC staff have described witnessing the impact of the suspension of contactless payments. At Euston station, in London, shop staff were seen shouting that it was cash only as the payments system was down.  Disruption was also seen in Glasgow, and a store at Edinburgh Haymarket seemingly closed early. M&amp;S says it had made the “decision to move some of our processes offline to protect our colleagues, partners, suppliers and our business”. But stores remain open and customers could “continue to shop on our website and our app”, the statement added. But confusion has reigned on social media amongst M&amp;S customers. The firm has responded to some posts on X (formerly Twitter) in the past few hours advising customers contactless payments can be taken in stores However, this has been contradicted by some individuals, with one saying: “That is wrong - only chip and pin or cash is working”. M&amp;S also told click &amp; collect customers not to travel to a store “until they have received their ‘Ready To Collect’ email”. Some customers also questioned that, with one person saying after receiving their email, “store staff said they are unable to retrieve the item” The company has declined to provide detail on the nature of the attack, but moving systems offline is often a response to ransomware attacks. On Tuesday the firm said in a notice to investors that it had engaged “external cyber security experts to assist with investigating and managing the incident. “We are taking actions to further protect our network and ensure we can continue to maintain customer service,” it added. The company said it also reported the incident to the National Cyber Security Centre which told the BBC it was “working with Marks and Spencer to support their response to a cyber incident”. The National Crime Agency told the BBC its officers were “working alongside partners in the NCSC to better understand the incident and support the company”. "

    "title": "Latest: China tells Trump - If you want trade talks, cancel tariffs",
    "body": "2025/04/24 - Here’s what you need to know: China has called on the US to cancel its sweeping tariffs on Chinese goods entering the country as a sign that US President Donald Trump is serious about resolving the trade war between the two countries. A Chinese official said there had been no trade talks with the US, despite suggestions otherwise from the Trump administration. The trade war between the world’s two largest economies has been escalating, with China sending back Boeing planes it ordered from the US in its latest retaliation over tariffs. But Trump has appeared to soften his stance on China, saying that the taxes he has so far imposed on Chinese imports would “come down substantially, but it won’t be zero”. A trade war between China and the US is in full swing, with Trump imposing import taxes of up to 145% on Chinese goods coming into the US, and China hitting back with a 125% tax on American products. In one of China’s strongest statements yet over the tariff war, Commerce Ministry spokesman He Yadong said the US should remove all “unilateral tariff measures” against China “if it truly wanted” to solve the issue. “The person who tied the bell must untie it,” he added. Separately, Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said China and the US had “not conducted consultations or negotiations on tariffs, let alone reached an agreement”. He added that reports to the contrary were “false”. Trump previously said negotiations between the countries were “active” - but this was also contradicted by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who said on Wednesday they had not yet begun. Bessent added that there was an opportunity for a “big deal” between the US and China on trade. He has previously said he expected a de-escalation of the “unsustainable” trade war, and said the current situation was “not a joke”. Trump said on Tuesday that he would be “very nice” in negotiations with Beijing in the hope of securing a trade deal. But following China’s latest comments, he said on his Truth Social media platform “Boeing should default China for not taking the beautifully finished planes that China committed to purchase”. “This is just a small example of what China has done to the USA, for years,” he added, before repeating accusations that synthetic opioid fentanyl “continues to pour into our country from China, through Mexico and Canada, killing hundreds of thousands of our people”. The boss of plane manufacturer Boeing revealed China had sent back aircraft it had ordered from the US as part of its retaliation to tariffs. Kelly Ortberg said this week that two planes had already been returned and another would follow due trade tensions between the two countries. China held a roundtable on Wednesday to address the concerns of more than 80 foreign firms over the impact of US tariffs on their investments and operations in China, the commerce ministry said. “It is hoped that foreign firms will turn crises into opportunities,” said Vice Commerce Minister Ling Ji.

    "title": "Update: Ed Miliband 'considering' regional energy pricing",
    "body": "2025/04/24 - According to new developments, Energy secretary Ed Miliband is “considering” plans to introduce regional pricing for power that could lead to lower bills in parts of the country that generate more energy. He did not set out details of the “zonal pricing” scheme, which is meant to make the national energy grid more efficient and encourage investment. But he rejected claims in a Daily Telegraph article that it would mean increased energy bills for southern English households. Some energy companies have backed the idea - but others say it will scare off investment and lead to higher bills. According to the Telegraph government officials have advised Miliband to back plans for a form of regional pricing used in some other parts of the world including Australia, Italy and Sweden. If implemented, it would be the biggest reform of the power market since the 1990s privatisation. Under the scheme, power costs would match local supply and demand. In practice it could lead to lower bills in areas with abundant wind generation like Scotland rather than households in the South. The scheme is supported by some energy businesses - including Greg Jackson, the boss of Octopus Energy, the UK’s largest domestic energy supplier. Mr Jackson said it could make the overall system more efficient and reduce the amount of network upgrades needed to shift the electricity from where it’s generated to where it’s consumed. But Dale Vince, the founder of green energy company Ecotricity and a Labour donor, said on BBC Radio 4’s Today Programme that zonal pricing was a “terrible idea” as “tens of millions of Britons could end up paying more for their energy than they do now”. Speaking ahead of an international energy security summit in London, Miliband said the government were considering options to change energy pricing but insisted “absolutely no decision has been made”. “This is an incredibly complex question that we are looking at about how we reform our energy market,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “There are two options, zonal pricing and reformed national pricing. “Whatever route we go down my bottom line is bills have got to fall, and they should fall throughout the country. “We are going to take our time over this very complex and important decision. ” The Liberal Democrats warned against regional pricing saying the “government has got to ensure that reforms to electricity pricing ultimately bring down customers’ bills and create a fairer system - across the board. ” The party’s energy and net zero spokesperson, Pippa Heylings, said: “In a cost-of-living crisis and when energy giants have been raking it in - energy bills should be going down not up. ” Reform UK leader Nigel Farage called the plans “a form of bribery”, saying cheaper bills would be a payoff for massive infrastructure projects “ruining” the local area. “None of this I think has been fully thought through,” he argued. “I think Ed Miliband has a religious fervour for achieving that zero, regardless of the consequences. ” The Green Party of England and Wales have also called on the government to reject regional pricing. Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay told the BBC: “People live in poverty all over the country - penalising families struggling to pay their bills because of where they happen to live would be wrong. ” The Conservatives have also been approached for comment.

    "body": "2025/04/24 - Experts revealed that Energy secretary Ed Miliband is “considering” plans to introduce regional pricing for power that could lead to lower bills in parts of the country that generate more energy. He did not set out details of the “zonal pricing” scheme, which is meant to make the national energy grid more efficient and encourage investment. But he rejected claims in a Daily Telegraph article that it would mean increased energy bills for southern English households. Some energy companies have backed the idea - but others say it will scare off investment and lead to higher bills. According to the Telegraph government officials have advised Miliband to back plans for a form of regional pricing used in some other parts of the world including Australia, Italy and Sweden. If implemented, it would be the biggest reform of the power market since the 1990s privatisation. Under the scheme, power costs would match local supply and demand. In practice it could lead to lower bills in areas with abundant wind generation like Scotland rather than households in the South. The scheme is supported by some energy businesses - including Greg Jackson, the boss of Octopus Energy, the UK’s largest domestic energy supplier. Mr Jackson said it could make the overall system more efficient and reduce the amount of network upgrades needed to shift the electricity from where it’s generated to where it’s consumed. But Dale Vince, the founder of green energy company Ecotricity and a Labour donor, said on BBC Radio 4’s Today Programme that zonal pricing was a “terrible idea” as “tens of millions of Britons could end up paying more for their energy than they do now”. Speaking ahead of an international energy security summit in London, Miliband said the government were considering options to change energy pricing but insisted “absolutely no decision has been made”. “This is an incredibly complex question that we are looking at about how we reform our energy market,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “There are two options, zonal pricing and reformed national pricing. “Whatever route we go down my bottom line is bills have got to fall, and they should fall throughout the country. “We are going to take our time over this very complex and important decision. ” The Liberal Democrats warned against regional pricing saying the “government has got to ensure that reforms to electricity pricing ultimately bring down customers’ bills and create a fairer system - across the board. ” The party’s energy and net zero spokesperson, Pippa Heylings, said: “In a cost-of-living crisis and when energy giants have been raking it in - energy bills should be going down not up. ” Reform UK leader Nigel Farage called the plans “a form of bribery”, saying cheaper bills would be a payoff for massive infrastructure projects “ruining” the local area. “None of this I think has been fully thought through,” he argued. “I think Ed Miliband has a religious fervour for achieving that zero, regardless of the consequences. ” The Green Party of England and Wales have also called on the government to reject regional pricing. Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay told the BBC: “People live in poverty all over the country - penalising families struggling to pay their bills because of where they happen to live would be wrong. ” The Conservatives have also been approached for comment.

    "body": "2025/04/24 - Experts revealed that Tech firms will have to do more to protect young people from harmful content under new safety measures announced by the media regulator. Ofcom’s own research found that 59% of 13 to 17-year olds surveyed had seen “potentially harmful content” online in the previous month. As part of implementing the Online Safety Act, the regulator has finalised a series of child safety rules which will come into force for social media, search and gaming apps and websites on 25 July 2025. Ofgem says the rules will prevent young people from encountering the most harmful content relating to suicide, self-harm, eating disorders and pornography. They are also designed to protect children from misogynistic, violent, hateful or abusive material, online bullying and dangerous challenges. Firms which wish to continue operating in the UK must adopt more than 40 practical measures, including: changing the algorithms which determine what is shown in children’s feeds to filter out harmful content implementing stricter age verification methods to check whether a user is under 18 removing identified harmful material more quickly, and support children who have been exposed to it identifying a named person in their company who is “accountable for children’s safety”, and annually review how they are managing risk to children on their platforms Failure to comply could result in businesses being fined Â£18m or 10% of their global revenues, or their executives being jailed. In very serious cases Ofcom says it can apply for a court order to prevent the site or app from being available in the UK. A number of campaigners want to see even stricter rules for tech firms, and some want under-16s banned from social media completely. Ian Russell, chairman of the Molly Rose Foundation - which was set up in memory of his daughter who took her own life aged 14 - said he was “dismayed by the lack of ambition” in the codes. Molly Russell took her own life in 2017 after being exposed to suicide and self-harm content on Instagram and Pinterest The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are also calling for stronger protection from the dangers of social media, saying “enough is not being done”. They unveiled a temporary memorial in New York City dedicated to children who have died due to the harms of the internet. “We want to make sure that things are changed so that… no more kids are lost to social media,” Prince Harry told BBC Breakfast. The NSPCC children’s charity argues that the law still doesn’t provide enough protection for private messaging apps. It says that the end-to-end encrypted services which they offer “continue to pose an unacceptable, major risk to children”. On the other side, privacy campaigners complain the new rules threaten users’ freedom. Some also argue age verification methods are invasive without being effective enough. Digital age checks can lead to “security breaches, privacy intrusion, errors, digital exclusion and censorship,” according to Silkie Carlo, director of Big Brother Watch. The bill also requires firms to show they are committed to removing illegal content, including: child sexual abuse controlling or coercive behaviour extreme sexual violence promoting suicide or self-harm selling illegal drugs or weapons terrorism The Act has also created new offences, such as: cyber-flashing - sending unsolicited sexual imagery online sharing “deepfake” pornography, where artificial intelligence is used to insert someone’s likeness into pornographic content Children aged eight to 17 spend between two and five hours online per day, according to Ofcom research, external. It found that nearly every child over 12 has a mobile phone and almost all of them watch videos on platforms such as YouTube or TikTok. About half of children over 12 think being online is good for their mental health, according to Ofcom, external. However, the Children’s Commissioner said that half of the 13-year-olds her team surveyed reported seeing “hardcore, misogynistic” pornographic material on social media sites. Children also said material about suicide self-harm and eating disorders was “prolific” and that violent content was “unavoidable”. The NSPCC says it’s vital that parents talk to their children about internet safety and take an interest in what they do online, external. Two-thirds of parents say they use controls to limit what their children see online, according to Internet Matters, a safety organisation set up by some of the big UK-based internet companies. It has a list of parental controls available and step-by-step guides, external on how to use them. These include advice on how to manage teen or child accounts on social media, video platforms such as YouTube, and gaming platforms such as Roblox or Fortnite. However Ofcom data suggests that about one in five children are able to disable parental controls. Instagram does not let 13 to 15-year-old users make their account public unless they add a parent or guardian to their Teen Account Instagram has already introduced “teen accounts” which turn on many privacy settings by default - although some researchers have claimed they were able to circumvent the promised protections. Ofcom: Guide for parents, external Keep kids off Roblox if you’re worried, its CEO tells parents Phone and broadband networks may block some explicit websites until a user has demonstrated they are over 18.

    "title": "New: Tax-free parcels rule used by Shein and Temu under review",
    "body": "2025/04/24 - According to new developments, Major retailers have welcomed the government’s review of a rule that allows small parcels to enter the UK duty-free, saying it gives overseas firms such as Shein and Temu an unfair advantage over British businesses. The current rule allows international retailers to send packages to the UK worth less than £135 without incurring import taxes. Former Dragons’ Den star Theo Paphitis, whose retail group includes the Ryman and Robert Dyas, told the BBC that the measure was ruining UK High Streets. Some retailers have argued that they are being undercut by overseas rivals, but a body representing small businesses said scrapping the exemption could raise costs for them and prices for customers. Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced on Wednesday that the government planned to review the customs treatment of low-value products entering the UK following complaints from retailers. The explosion of parcels being shipped under the measure has prompted increased scrutiny in recent years. While all retailers use the exemption, those who sell fast-fashion and cheap goods have seen sales soar. It has fuelled the rise of Chinese retailers, such as online giants Shein and Temu, which ship low-value packages to the UK and other countries to reach millions of customers. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr Paphitis said retailers had been lobbying government “for a very, very long time”, arguing the rule had a devastating impact “on our retail landscape and our high streets”. He joined the bosses of Sainsbury’s, Currys and the British Retail Consortium in welcoming the government’s consultation on the rule. UK businesses bringing in larger shipments have to pay taxes, and they also argue that cheaper goods might fail to meet the same environmental and ethical standards that they have to keep to. Aside from concerns over unfair competition with domestic retailers, it has also been raised that governments could be missing out on potential tax income. The so-called “de minimis” rule has received renewed interest after US President Donald Trump scrapped a similar measure amid his escalating trade war with China. Goods worth less than $800 moving into the US will soon be subject to charges, when they were previously exempt. The move has already prompted Chinese retailers to raise their prices. In the UK, there are further concerns that China will dump goods here to avoid the tariffs which Trump has imposed on its exports. Earlier this month, the boss of Currys told the Financial Times that the “single biggest area where lots of stock is likely to land in the UK… is from the likes of Shein, Temu, Alibaba, TikTok shop and, most of all, Amazon marketplace”. On Thursday, Alex Baldock told the BBC that he was pleased the government was “reviewing the low-value shipment loophole, and that they’re committed to levelling the playing field between British and overseas retailers”. But the Federation of Small Businesses urged the government to proceed with caution in its de minimis consultation, suggesting that scrapping it might “ultimately lead to higher prices for consumers”. “With 16% of goods moved by small firms sitting below the £135 threshold, a decision to scrap it impacts on trading and inflation,” said Tina McKenzie, chair of the FSB. “It’s right to be concerned about potential future dumping of goods, as escalating tariffs applied by bigger global blocs against each other may mean a surge in goods arriving in markets like our own,” she added. Mr Paphitis told the BBC it was “absolute nonsense” that the measure kept inflation and prices down, arguing it led to a loss of jobs and tax revenue for the UK, due to businesses being unable to compete with cheaper foreign rivals. Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, the trade body for retailers, said the review was “more critical now” due to a “rise in the number of potentially non-compliant products entering the UK market”. The British Independent Retailers Association said small packages having no tax or charges was a key concern. It called on ministers to act to “deter import surges” in order to “protect independent retailers”. When Sainsbury’s announced their latest financial results earlier this month, boss Simon Roberts called on the government to act as soon as possible. “Everyone should pay their tax… So if there’s a loophole here which means that’s not happening, then that needs to be closed so it’s a level playing field for everybody,” he said.

    "body": "2025/04/24 - Experts revealed that Websites will have to change the algorithms that recommend content to young people and introduce beefed-up age checks or face big fines, the UK media regulator has confirmed. Ofcom says its “Children’s Codes” - the final versions of which have now been published - will offer “transformational new protections”. Platforms which host pornography, or offer content which encourages self-harm, suicide or eating disorders are among those which must take more robust action to prevent children accessing their content. Ofcom boss Dame Melanie Dawes said it was a “gamechanger” but critics say the restrictions do not go far enough and were “a bitter pill to swallow”. Ian Russell, chairman of the Molly Rose Foundation, which was set up in memory of his daughter - who took her own life aged 14 - said he was “dismayed by the lack of ambition” in the codes. But Dame Melanie told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that age checks were a first step as “unless you know where children are, you can’t give them a different experience to adults. “There is never anything on the internet or in real life that is fool proof… [but] this represents a gamechanger. ” She admitted that while she was “under no illusions” that some companies “simply either don’t get it or don’t want to”, but emphasised the Codes had legal force. “If they want to serve the British public and if they want the privilege in particular in offering their services to under 18s, then they are going to need to change the way those services operate. ” Prof Victoria Baines, a former safety officer at Facebook told the BBC it is “a step in the right direction”. Talking to the Today Programme, she said: “Big tech companies are really getting to grips with it , so they are putting money behind it, and more importantly they’re putting people behind it. ” Technology Secretary Peter Kyle said key to the rules was tackling the algorithms which decide what children get shown online. “The vast majority of kids do not go searching for this material, it just lands in their feeds,” he told BBC Radio 5 Live. Kyle told The Telegraph he was separately looking into a social media curfew for under-16s, but would not “act on something that will have a profound impact on every single child in the country without making sure that the evidence supports it”. The new rules for platforms are subject to parliamentary approval under the Online Safety Act. The regulator says they contain more than 40 practical measures tech firms must take, including: If companies fail to abide by the regulations, Ofcom said it has “the power to impose fines and - in very serious cases - apply for a court order to prevent the site or app from being available in the UK. ” Children’s charity the NSPCC broadly welcomed the Codes, calling them “a pivotal moment for children’s safety online. ” But they called for Ofcom to go further, especially when it came to private messaging apps which are often encrypted - meaning platforms cannot see what is being sent.

    "body": "2025/04/24 - It has been recently reported that Since Bekki Thomas was a teenager, she has experienced crippling pain and chronic fatigue that lasted weeks at a time. Despite the severe symptoms, it took eight years for doctors to diagnose the Clevedon woman with endometriosis. GPs initially said her pain was caused from “over-exercise” or “anxiety”. The 26-year-old is now calling for more research and awareness about the condition to help other women. “When I was 11, I remember being in a lot of pain. I thought it was pretty normal and just meant to be like that. There wasn’t any research going into it, we didn’t know much about it,” she said. About 1. 5 million women in the UK are thought to have the condition, which causes pain and extreme tiredness as a result of tissue similar to the womb lining growing elsewhere in the body. When she was 13 years old, Ms Thomas said she remembered “keeling over in agony” at the back of the classroom. “I knew something wasn’t quite right,” Ms Thomas said. “My skin seemed a lot worse than anyone I knew, my back pain was crazy. It didn’t seem quite normal to me. “Three weeks out of every month I was going through that. ” Her doctor put her on the Pill to help manage the pain but it gave her migraines, so she came off it in 2018. The pain then grew worse, and her doctor said it must be caused by “anxiety or over-exercise”. It was only after her sister googled the symptoms that Ms Thomas was able to return to her surgery and ask to be tested for endometriosis. The only treatment offered to her was a Mirena coil, and she feels she has been “put on the back burner” with no further medication. She has now found a support group where people with the condition can talk about their experiences. “It’s good to speak to other women who have it,” Ms Thomas said. “There is no cure. Pain management can be difficult. “I mask it a lot at work and in relationships because you don’t want to be a burden. “There needs to be more research and funding. And making more space for women. ” A spokesperson for the Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire Integrated Care Board said they “encourage anyone with concerns about their care to discuss these with their care provider”. “We are working with general practitioners across Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire to ensure women receive the support and care they need. “This includes updating referral guidance on endometriosis, as well as other gynaecological conditions, and providing training and education,” they added.

    "title": "Latest: 'We have had kids hurt because of no carpets'",
    "body": "2025/04/24 - Let’s dive into the details: Children have been injured and patients left stuck in hospital because of a lack of carpet in their homes, a charity has said. The Noah’s Ark Centre, in Halifax, has fitted carpets in more than 400 homes since 2023 and said it had more than 70 people on its waiting list. By law UK landlords only have to put flooring in kitchens and bathrooms, with campaign group End Furniture Poverty saying at least 1. 2m homes have no carpet or flooring in their bedrooms and living areas. Andrew Sykes, from the Noah’s Ark Centre, said carpet was “not just to make a home look pretty, it’s to make a home safer and warmer”. Mr Sykes said: “We’ve had children hospitalised because of splinters in toes [and] I can think of at least three clients who were bed blocking in hospital because the hospitals wouldn’t release them home because they didn’t have carpets down. ” The vast majority of people living without flooring in all rooms - 760,000 - were in social housing, according to a survey of 5,500 people carried out by The National Centre for Social Research. Often social landlords rip up flooring when a tenant moves on hygiene grounds - but it is not always replaced quickly. When Chloe Ramsden and her five-year-old son moved into their home in Halifax there was only flooring in the kitchen and bathroom. She said she had managed to save, with the help of her family, to buy carpet for the property but it had been damaged in a fire, leaving her with no flooring downstairs. Ms Ramsden said her son, who has additional needs, had struggled with the bare floorboards. “He doesn’t like keeping things on his feet, so to just sit down in the living room and watch telly like a normal family causes a lot of emotional distress for him,” she said. “It’s cold, it’s sharp, it’s hard. My heating bill has skyrocketed because it’s freezing. It’s something very overlooked. People don’t often think about flooring when moving house but actually it’s quite a big thing for families. ” Noah’s Ark Centre began providing carpet to those in need after teaming up with Leeds flooring provider Mercado. John Clark, from Mercado, had contacted the charity after reading a BBC News article about social housing not providing new tenants with flooring. “I read a heart breaking story about a mother who’d just moved into a house, and her young child got some splinters in his toes and was in quite a lot of pain,” he said. “We have discontinued lines and we struggle to recycle them at times [so] we decided to donate them to charity. It seemed the right thing to do. ” Noah’s Ark has a waiting list of 70 people needing carpets or flooring. “The cost of living crisis has been particularly brutal the last few years for those on the lowest incomes and people have to prioritise,” Mr Sykes said. “You have to prioritise feeding and clothing your children but a carpet is not just to make a home look pretty, it’s to make a home safer and warmer. ” Ms Ramsden said she had been trying to save for new flooring but as a single mum, working part time, said she had found it difficult. “I’ll put £20 away and then my son will need new school shoes or we’ll need food, milk, butter or whatever so we have to dip into that. It’s just impossible. ” Noah’s Ark has now fitted carpet in living room and flooring to her kitchen after she contacted the charity for help. “I’m very excited, more so for my son. I can’t wait to get him home from school because he knows it’s happening,” she said. “The first thing he asked this morning was, ‘I don’t have to wear my shoes when I come from school do I?’ and so he’s very excited. ” Claire Donovan, End Furniture Poverty Director, added: “Living without flooring has an impact on your comfort, the warmth of your home, and your mental wellbeing. “It’s also unsafe for families with young children, the elderly and those with disabilities to be living with concrete floors or rough floorboards, often with nails sticking out. “We would urge all landlords to immediately stop the policy of asking tenants to remove flooring when they move out, instead assess it and if it is good enough quality, clean and leave in place for the next tenant. ” Listen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North.

    "body": "2025/04/24 - Experts revealed that Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) takes a “significant” toll on daily life and relationships, a study has found. PMDD, which is a severe cyclical, hormone-based mood disorder linked to periods, is thought to affect more than one in 20 women. Research led by Durham University studied 400 people and found those with the disorder reported lower quality of life and relationships. Lead author Dr Sophie Hodgetts said the study “clearly highlights the need for greater clinical recognition of the interpersonal impact of PMDD”. PMDD sufferers, which accounted for over 50% of respondents (216), expressed a lower sense of intimacy, trust and passion within their relationships. Researchers also found partners expressed feelings of high stress, a diminished sense of personal growth and worth, difficulties or inabilities within their caregiving roles, and a general sense of feeling unsupported. They also reported similar levels of dissatisfaction within their relationships. However, both sufferers and partners agreed “love” and “commitment” remained unaffected, with strong and consistent responses in these areas from people living with the condition and their companions. Dr Hodgetts added: “It is particularly striking that the patterns of difficulty reported were so similar for both PMDD sufferers and their partners,” she said. The study was conducted with the support of the International Association for Premenstrual Disorders. Additionally, the collaboration is exploring the lived experiences of undergoing treatment for PMDD and investigating the intersection of PMDD and neurodivergence.

    "body": "2025/04/24 - It has been recently reported that The price of Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency has soared after the US president promised to host two special events for its top investors. The website for the $Trump meme coin says its 220 biggest holders will be invited to a private gala dinner with the president on 22 May, describing it as the “most EXCLUSIVE INVITATION in the world. ” According to crypto trading platform Coinbase, $Trump jumped by more than 70% after the announcement. But it remains well below the record high of more than $74 (£42. 40) reached shortly after its launch in January. The digital currency is one of several crypto-related ventures launched by businesses linked to Trump, who has called himself the “crypto president”. As well as the gala dinner, which will be held at the Trump National Golf Club in Washington DC, there will be “an ultra-exclusive private VIP reception with the President” for the top 25 coin holders, the coin’s website said. Trump tokens in circulation are currently worth a total of around $2. 5bn. They were first released just days before his inauguration on 20 January. The move was criticised by several people in the crypto industry, with some calling it “a stunt”. First lady Melania Trump also launched a cryptocurrency on the eve of the inauguration. Meme coins are often used by speculators to make money or to allow fans to show support to a celebrity or moment in internet culture. Shortly after returning to the White House this year, Trump signed an executive order to create a presidential working group tasked with proposing new crypto laws and regulations. He has also signed an order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve as well as a Digital Asset Stockpile, which will include other digital currencies. Those funds will be stocked with coins forfeited to the federal government as part of criminal or civil proceedings. This week, Trump’s media company announced plans to launch exchange traded-funds (ETFs). The financial products to be launched by Trump Media &amp; Technology Group, owner of the Truth Social platform, and its partners will include digital assets as well as stocks with a “Made in America focus”. ETFs are investment funds that hold multiple assets. They can be bought and sold in a similar way to shares. "

    "title": "Update: Millions of vapes seized in illegal trade crackdown",
    "body": "2025/04/24 - Let’s dive into the details: More than six million illegal vaping products have been seized by Trading Standards officers across England in the past three years, new analysis by the BBC has found. We joined one of the teams responsible for tracking down the illicit goods as they prepare for a ban on the sale of single-use disposable vapes. Paul Leighton is packing his rucksack with a heavy-duty hammer, pry bar and evidence bags for what he describes as “just an average day out”. As the senior Trading Standards officer at Newcastle City Council, he has learned the hiding places used to conceal illegal vapes can be sophisticated. Sometimes, he has to force his way in. He has found them hidden everywhere from inside fridges and barbecues to behind fake fuse boxes and tiled panels complete with hydraulic lifts. “I’ve seen entire kitchens come away from walls and off the floor as well… so all sorts of hiding places,” he says. Classified as illicit or non-compliant vapes, the products he will be searching for today fail to meet the legal requirements for sale in the UK. More than six million of them were seized in England between 2022 and 2024, according to analysis by the BBC. The health risks posed to unwitting customers are summed up by Connor Lamb, a senior technician for licensing also taking part in the unannounced checks on shops. If you get a normal vape, he says, “they’ve got a capacity which is enough for 600 puffs - the equivalent to 20 cigarettes”. But if you get an illegal one, “it can be anything from 200 cigarettes in one vape. Obviously someone buying this to go on a night out or a kid might just be chuffing on it all day and you can imagine the drastic effect that’ll have on someone’s lungs. ” According to Trading Standards, illicit or non-compliant vapes can be anything with tank sizes greater than 2ml, a nicotine strength of more than 20ml or labels that do not display manufacturer details and health warnings. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency strongly advises consumers not to use them as the true content - and any possible health risk - is unknown. On the road, Paul and Connor quickly find a stash of between 12 and 20 packs of illegal vapes at the back of a shop counter. “It would be unusual to have so few in a shop that sells quite frequently like this, so it’s just a case of where they’re hiding the rest,” says Paul. We head to a room at the back of the shop. There is a stench of urine. It is full of litter and we are deep in seemingly empty cardboard boxes. Paul’s hunch is proven right though as a search among the rubbish unearths a box of illegal vapes. Of 136 local Trading Standards bodies in England, 133 responded to BBC Freedom of Information requests, showing that between 2022 and 2024: Selling illegal vapes was a factor in at least 316 shop closures during that period, while selling to children was a factor in at least 67. Most of the closures were temporary and some retailers may have been shut down more than once. The Independent British Vape Trade Association (IBVTA) insists the majority of vape shops operate within the law, serving adults who would otherwise be smoking. A spokesperson said: “These business owners would never knowingly involve themselves in criminal activity. Rather, it is since the resurgence of popularity of single-use vapes, and therefore a popular ‘cash market’, that we’ve seen organised crime gangs get involved in importing and distributing vapes. ” They said IBVTA had long called for greater enforcement action at borders to stem the flow of illegal products entering the country. The Department of Health and Social Care said it was allocating an extra £10m this financial year for Trading Standards to tackle underage and illicit sales, with an expected 80 additional apprentice enforcement officers to be funded. Paul and Connor agree single-use vapes are among the main driving forces of the illegal trade and hope the coming ban will improve the situation. “These are quite sophisticated networks that we’re up against who are also involved in lots of quite serious activities as well as modern day slavery, trafficking, drug supply,” says Paul. “I think we’ll see a lot less product taken off the street because we haven’t really had a massive issue with reusable vapes for quite some time. “They’ve always been broadly compliant in terms of the devices that are being used, the batteries, the liquids, the odd oversized tank here. ” From 1 June, it will be illegal for businesses in the UK to sell, supply or possess single-use vapes for sale. Those caught doing so will get a £200 on-the-spot fine in the first instance, rising to an unlimited fine and/or a prison sentence of up to two years for repeat offences. The government has said Trading Standards will be able to keep the full value of the on-the-spot fines, to reinvest into enforcement. Extra enforcement powers and funding are something IBVTA says it welcomes, noting “not all Trading Standards teams are equally or adequately resourced” and “some areas with low regulatory compliance are unable to carry out the enforcement they would want to”. But a national spokesperson for Trading Standards said its work was “definitely having an impact”. Government funding had enabled “extra boots on the ground” at Heathrow Airport and Dover Port, the spokesperson said, which explained the high number of seizures by the local authorities home to those border points – Hillingdon and Kent. In Hillingdon alone, 2,099,248 vaping products were seized between 2022-2024, making up a third of the total. They said Salford was home to a number of vape warehouses supplying products across England, meaning “seizing at this stage in the supply chain is really effective”. However, they said there was still a “huge challenge in terms of retailers prepared to sell illegal products as well as those who persistently sell to children”. Back in Newcastle, Paul offers a similar assessment of the task faced nationally. He estimates the number of illegal vapes still circulating in the country is “easily in the millions at the moment”, adding: “It’s a constant battle trying to make a difference. ” Additional reporting by Jonathan Fagg and Miguel Roca-Terry Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

But a national spokesperson for Trading Standards said its work was “definitely having an impact”. Government funding had enabled “extra boots on the ground” at Heathrow Airport and Dover Port, the spokesperson said, which explained the high number of seizures by the local authorities home to those border points – Hillingdon and Kent. In Hillingdon alone, 2,099,248 vaping products were seized between 2022-2024, making up a third of the total. They said Salford was home to a number of vape warehouses supplying products across England, meaning “seizing at this stage in the supply chain is really effective”. However, they said there was still a “huge challenge in terms of retailers prepared to sell illegal products as well as those who persistently sell to children”. Back in Newcastle, Paul offers a similar assessment of the task faced nationally. He estimates the number of illegal vapes still circulating in the country is “easily in the millions at the moment”, adding: “It’s a constant battle trying to make a difference. ” Additional reporting by Jonathan Fagg and Miguel Roca-Terry Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "title": "New: Exhausted hospital staff putting patients at risk, says watchdog",
    "body": "2025/04/24 - Here’s what you need to know: Extreme tiredness and exhaustion among NHS staff poses a significant risk to patients, England’s NHS safety watchdog warns. The Health Services Safety Investigations Body said medication errors, impaired decision-making, reduced attention and rude and disrespectful behaviour were the most common problems associated with fatigued staff in hospitals. It said there was limited data on the scale of the problem, but cited evidence from staff surveys and information provided by safety experts that it was a contributory factor in safety incidents. In its report, the watchdog gave examples of mistakes being made with pregnancy scans and chemotherapy drugs. In one case a mother and baby were harmed after an inaccurate scan, with the staff member saying fatigue and workload contributed. In the chemotherapy case the staff were nearly nine hours into a 12. 5-hour day shift and had only managed five to six hours of sleep between shifts and had limited breaks because of staffing pressures. The hospital investigation found fatigue was “likely to have been a factor”. Some staff reported being sleep-deprived on a daily basis. And one doctor told the watchdog: “When it gets to that third day of doing these 12-hour nights it’s dangerous from 2am onwards… do I have the energy or the brain space or the mental space to even make a life-changing decision for a patient at this point?” The watchdog said exhaustion was also a risk to staff themselves with some complaining of nodding off at the wheel on the way home and reports of staff dying in road accidents after work. Shift work, long working hours, lack of breaks, caring responsibilities and financial pressures were all cited as factors in staff fatigue. The watchdog said the issue was often misunderstood in the NHS and thought of more as a wellbeing issue rather than a safety issue. It said the government and NHS England needed to introduce better systems to monitor fatigue and work with unions and employers to raise awareness about it. Senior safety investigator Saskia Fursland said: “Fatigue is more than just being tired - it can significantly impair decision-making, motor skills, and alertness. “We must move away from viewing fatigue as an individual issue and putting the onus on personal responsibility and instead treat it as a system-level risk that deserves urgent attention. ” Dr Latifa Patel, of the British Medical Association, said the findings were concerning, but not surprising with doctors facing long shifts back-to-back with little respite. She said there needed to be better rota design to ensure staff could rest properly between shifts and improved rest facilities in hospitals. But she said fatigue was also “often driven by workforce shortages” too. A spokesperson for NHS England said it recognised staff were at risk of burnout and was “committed” to ensuring they got the support they needed to provide safe care. “Staff should always feel confident to report patient safety concerns, including those that are linked to fatigue, and we will work with local NHS systems to address any issues,” he added. He said the NHS was offering more flexible working options than ever before and there was a range of mental health support available for staff.

    "title": "Update: 'My peanut allergy nearly killed me - now I eat them every day for breakfast'",
    "body": "2025/04/23 - Let’s dive into the details: Chris Brookes-Smith, 28, used to live in fear of dying from eating even the smallest trace of peanut. Ten years ago he had his worst allergic reaction after ordering a curry at a local Indian takeaway. The trauma of it is seared into his memory. “I knew I was in trouble after one bite,” he says. “Within seconds there were spots on my lips. Within minutes I was vomiting. I could feel my throat closing up, hives forming in my armpits then over my whole body… My face going all puffy with the swelling. ” His voice tails off, full of emotion. “I thought I was going to die. ” Photos taken in hospital later that day show the toll the reaction took on his body. “I looked like a plucked turkey because my skin had blistered so much,” Chris says. But the most painful thing were the hives - red, raised bumps on the skin - which felt “like boiling water had been poured over me”. Trying to avoid peanuts, one of the most common food allergies, has been a way of life for Chris and millions of other adults with a serious allergy. Eating out, going to social events and travelling abroad are all fraught with anxiety. As many as one in 200 adults and one in 50 children have a nut allergy, charities say. Some children grow out of their allergies, but many don’t - and they continue into adulthood, often getting worse. An allergic reaction occurs when the body reacts to the protein in peanuts, thinking it’s a threat, which triggers a sudden release of chemicals. Symptoms can range from the mild to very serious. Chris’s allergy first came to light as a baby, when he developed a rash as his mum made peanut butter sandwiches. Each reaction since has been worse than the one before, which means he’s become accustomed to living every day “on high alert hoping nothing bad happens”. Activities such as going out with friends or eating in restaurants, which should be enjoyable, turned into stressful, potentially life-threatening experiences. Despite a love of travel, Chris avoided going to countries where peanuts are commonly used, like south east Asia, after three allergic reactions on a trip to Italy. As Chris grew up, his family constantly worried about him. But then his mum heard about a clinical trial at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust and King’s College London that would change her son’s life. It would test whether adults like Chris with serious peanut allergies could be desensitised by training their bodies to tolerate the very thing that could kill it, calming down the immune system when it would usually over-react. Despite being “really nervous”, Chris agreed to sign up. Under the watchful eye of doctors, Chris started by eating a fraction of a milligram of peanut powder mixed with yoghurt. Over many months, the amount of peanut was gradually increased, slowly building up to Chris eating fractions of nuts and, finally, whole nuts. By the end of the nine-month study, 14 of the 21 patients could eat the equivalent of five peanuts without having allergic reactions - including Chris. Professor Stephen Till, who led the research, says the treatment “has potential to have a real impact on patients’ lives”. “Most severe reactions occur because of mistakes, usually by somebody else, and miscommunication. So it provides them with some protection against that. “They’ve taken control, if you like, of their peanut allergy now. ” The method - called oral immunotherapy - is already proven to work for allergies to pollen, wasp and bee stings. It’s only been used on food allergies in the last 20 years, and mostly in children whose immune systems are still developing. Adult allergies are thought to be harder to shift. “Peanut allergy is very common in children and almost never goes away,” says Prof Till. “Those young people are going to become adults, so we need treatments for adults too. ” This trial, published in the journal Allergy, shows adults with serious allergies can increase the amount of peanut they can tolerate by 100 times. Chris, who lives in Northamptonshire, had no idea how he would react to even the slightest trace of peanut. Increasing that dose - willingly - every day was something he couldn’t imagine. “The first time I went there and I ingest this stuff, my heart’s going a million miles an hour,” he says. “The big jump in fear was going from peanut dust to half a whole nut. ” But he was reassured by having a team of doctors and nurses present, with drugs such as adrenaline standing by in case of a severe, life-threatening reaction. “You’ve got 100 eyes on you - nothing is gonna happen. ” However, experts stress no one should try this at home on their own because of the risk of a serious allergic reaction occurring. Not everyone who tried the treatment was desensitised, and larger trials in more people will have to work out why that is. “For some people, there were reactions and we had to slow down or go back a step,” explains Prof Till. “But the message is that you can desensitise adults to peanuts -and there should be more focus on adults in the future. ” Being able to eat peanuts safely had a huge impact on the lives of those who took part, the researchers say. It has given them freedom to travel, reduced their anxiety when eating out and removed their fear of food. How to develop this into a practical treatment on the NHS is more of a challenge. First, larger trials are needed to prove it can work for more people. And researchers are looking at whether putting drops of peanut in solution under the tongue could be a safer way of achieving the same end result. Chris now eats four peanuts every morning with his breakfast granola to keep his allergy at bay – as recommended by his doctors. He’s grateful for having had the opportunity to take part in the trial and hopes many others with serious peanut allergies can also benefit from the treatment. While he admits he still hates the flavour of peanuts, he says knowing he can now eat something that once sent his body into “nuclear meltdown” has changed his life. “It’s a wonderful feeling,” Chris says. “I’m no longer afraid of dying. ” Sign up here to receive our weekly newsletter highlighting uplifting stories and remarkable people from around the world.

    "title": "Update: Opportunity for big US-China trade deal, says Bessent",
    "body": "2025/04/23 - Let’s dive into the details: There is an opportunity for a “big deal” between the US and China on trade, America’s Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said. Asked about an upcoming meeting between the countries, Bessent said it would be an “incredible opportunity” to strike an agreement, if China was “serious” on making its economy less dependent on manufacturing exports. “China needs to change. The country knows it needs to change. Everyone knows it needs to change. And we want to help it change because we need rebalancing too,” he said. The comments come as the trade war between the world’s two biggest economies has escalated in recent weeks. US President Donald Trump has brought in a number of tariffs on imports to the US which he has said are aimed at increasing US manufacturing and protecting jobs. These include import taxes of up to 145% on Chinese goods, but China has hit back with a 125% tax on US products. Speaking at the Institute of International Finance conference on Wednesday, Bessent, said it was a “matter of impetus and will”. “There is an opportunity for a big deal here, that the US is looking to rebalance to more manufacturing, the identity of that would be less consumption. “If China is serious on less dependence on export-led manufacturing growth, and a rebalancing towards a domestic economy… if they want to rebalance, let’s do it together. ” The comments come after Bessent reportedly said on Tuesday that he expected a de-escalation of the trade war and that the current situation was “not a joke”. Trump has also said he is optimistic about improving trade relations with China, saying the level of tariffs - or import taxes - that he had imposed on Chinese imports would “come down substantially, but it won’t be zero”. Tensions between China and the US have shaken investors, with violent swings in share prices and sharp falls in the dollar. Stocks surged on Wednesday on hopes that trade tensions between the US and China could soon ease. Aside from the trade war, Bessent called on the IMF and the World Bank to refocus on the core missions of economic stability and development, arguing that they had strayed too far into vanity projects such as “climate change, gender and social issue”. “These issues are not the IMF’s mission,” he said. Tensions between the countries have rattled financial markets, with both sides introducing strong tariffs on each other. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said that he was “very frankly encouraged” by Bessent’s comments on the IMF and World Bank. Although Mr Bessent said the IMF and the World Bank are “falling short” he did not call for the US to withdraw from the institutions as some conservatives have lobbied for. He said the Trump administration will use US influence at these institutions and “push them to accomplish their important mandates”. "

Speaking at the Institute of International Finance conference on Wednesday, Bessent, said it was a “matter of impetus and will”. “There is an opportunity for a big deal here, that the US is looking to rebalance to more manufacturing, the identity of that would be less consumption. “If China is serious on less dependence on export-led manufacturing growth, and a rebalancing towards a domestic economy… if they want to rebalance, let’s do it together. ” The comments come after Bessent reportedly said on Tuesday that he expected a de-escalation of the trade war and that the current situation was “not a joke”. Trump has also said he is optimistic about improving trade relations with China, saying the level of tariffs - or import taxes - that he had imposed on Chinese imports would “come down substantially, but it won’t be zero”. Tensions between China and the US have shaken investors, with violent swings in share prices and sharp falls in the dollar. Stocks surged on Wednesday on hopes that trade tensions between the US and China could soon ease. Aside from the trade war, Bessent called on the IMF and the World Bank to refocus on the core missions of economic stability and development, arguing that they had strayed too far into vanity projects such as “climate change, gender and social issue”. “These issues are not the IMF’s mission,” he said. Tensions between the countries have rattled financial markets, with both sides introducing strong tariffs on each other. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said that he was “very frankly encouraged” by Bessent’s comments on the IMF and World Bank. Although Mr Bessent said the IMF and the World Bank are “falling short” he did not call for the US to withdraw from the institutions as some conservatives have lobbied for. He said the Trump administration will use US influence at these institutions and “push them to accomplish their important mandates”. "

    "body": "2025/04/23 - It has been recently reported that China has sent back planes it ordered from the US in its latest retaliation over Trump tariffs, the boss of aircraft maker Boeing has said. Kelly Ortberg said two planes had already been returned and another would follow after trade tensions between the two countries escalated. Boeing’s chief executive told CNBC that 50 more planes were due to go to China this year but their customers had indicated they will not take delivery of them. The US put 145% tariffs on imports from China and it hit back with a 125% tax on US products. Speaking in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump said he was optimistic about improving trade relations with China, saying the level of tariffs he had imposed would “come down substantially, but it won’t be zero”. However, Mr Ortberg said China “have in fact stopped taking delivery of aircraft because of tariff environment”. Boeing is America’s largest exporter with about 70% of its commercial aircraft sales outside of the US. Mr Ortberg said Boeing was assessing options to re-market 41 of the already built planes to other customers as there was high demand from other airlines. He said there were nine planes not yet in Boeing’s production system and he wanted to “understand their intentions and if necessary we can assign to other customers”. He added Boeing was “not going continue to build aircraft for customers who will not take them”. Later in the afternoon, Mr Ortberg told an investor call “there is not a day that goes by that we’re not engaged with either cabinet secretaries or either POTUS himself (President Trump) regarding the trade war between China and the USA. ” He added he was “very hopeful we’ll get to some negotiations”. On Wednesday, America’s Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told the International Monetary Fund (IMF) conference there was an opportunity for a “big deal” between the US and China on trade. Asked about an upcoming meeting between the countries, Bessent said it would be an “incredible opportunity” to strike an agreement, if China was “serious” on making its economy less dependent on manufacturing exports. Mr Ortberg also told investors others in the Boeing supply chain were now exposed to tariffs - mainly in Japan and Italy where universal tariffs of 10% are being implemented. Brian West, Boeing’s chief financial officer said during the call “free trade policy is very important to us” and Boeing will continue to work to with suppliers to ensure continuity. Boeing has reported smaller losses for the first quarter of the year after it manufactured and delivered more planes. Production had slumped in 2024 due to a series of crises and a strike by about 30,000 American factory workers. It wants to increase output of its 737 MAX jets to 38 a month in 2025. "

    "body": "2025/04/23 - Here’s what you need to know: Young Instagram users could still be exposed to “serious risks” even if they use new Teen Accounts brought in to provide more protection and control, research by campaigners suggests. Researchers behind a new report have said they were able to set up accounts using fake birthdays and they were then shown sexualised content, hateful comments, and recommended adult accounts to follow. Meta, which owns Instagram, says the report is “filled with inaccuracies and demonstrates a misunderstanding” of the Teen Accounts, and that parents “find these new protections helpful”. The research, from online child safety charity 5Rights Foundation, is released as Ofcom, the UK regulator, is about to publish its children’s safety codes. They will outline the rules platforms will have to follow under the Online Safety Act. Platforms will then have three months to show that they have systems in place which protect children. That includes robust age checks, safer algorithms which don’t recommend harmful content, and effective content moderation. Instagram Teen Accounts were set up in September 2024 to offer new protections for children and to create what Meta called “peace of mind for parents”. The new accounts were designed to limit who could contact users and reduce the amount of content young people could see. Existing users would be transferred to the new accounts and those signing up for the first time would automatically get one. But researchers from 5Rights Foundation were able to set up a series of fake Teen Accounts using false birthdays, with no additional checks by the platform. They found that immediately on sign up they were offered adult accounts to follow and message. Instagram’s algorithms, they claim, “still promote sexualised imagery, harmful beauty ideals and other negative stereotypes”. The researchers said their Teen Accounts were also recommended posts “filled with significant amounts of hateful comments”. The charity also had concerns about the addictive nature of the app and exposure to sponsored, commercialised content. Baroness Beeban Kidron founder of 5Rights Foundation said: “This is not a teen environment. ” “They are not checking age, they are recommending adults, they are putting them in commercial situations without letting them know and it’s deeply sexualised. ” Meta said the report was “filled with inaccuracies and demonstrates a misunderstanding of how Teen Accounts work, which we could have clarified if [5Rights Foundation] had shared the report with us”. A spokesperson said: “We developed Teen Accounts following feedback from parents, and a recent survey showed that 94% of parents find these new protections helpful. “Fundamentally changing Instagram for tens of millions of teens around the world is a big undertaking, and we know we will need to work tirelessly to get it right and bring parents peace of mind. ” In a separate development BBC News has also learned about the existence of groups dedicated to self-harm on X. The groups or “communities”, as they are known on the platform, contain tens of thousands of members sharing graphic images and videos of self-harm. Some of the users involved in the groups appear to be children. Becca Spinks, an American researcher who discovered the groups, said: “I was absolutely floored to see 65,000 members of a community. ” “It was so graphic, there were people in there taking polls on where they should cut next. ” X was approached for comment, but did not respond. But in a submission to an Ofcom consultation last year X said: “We have clear rules in place to protect the safety of the service and the people using it. ” “In the UK, X is committed to complying with the Online Safety Act,” it added.

    "title": "Update: Apple and Meta attack 'unfair' €700m EU fines",
    "body": "2025/04/23 - Experts revealed that The European Union has ordered Apple and Meta to pay a combined €700m (£599m) in the first fines it has issued under legislation intended to curb the power of big tech. It has issued a €500m (£428m) fine to Apple over its App Store, while Meta has been fined €200m (£171m) over how much choice users had to consent to data collection. “We have a duty to protect the rights of citizens and innovative businesses in Europe,” Commissioner Henna Virkkunen said in a statement. The two tech firms have reacted angrily, with Meta accusing the EU of “attempting to handicap successful American businesses” and Apple saying it was being “unfairly targeted” and forced to “give away our technology for free. ” The fines are lower than some of those issued by the EU in the past but - given the heightened economic tensions with America - still risk angering US President Donald Trump. The US has levied a 10% tariff on imports from the EU, which Trump has accused of “taking advantage” of America. EU spokesperson Arianna Podesta insisted the matters were “completely separate”, telling the BBC: “This is about enforcement, it’s not about trade negotiations. ” The White House has been contacted for comment. The European Commission - the EU’s executive - started both investigations last year under a new law brought in to promote fairness in the tech sector called the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The case against Apple was over its App Store. The Commission says it must freely offer alternative app marketplaces to users and app developers - and says Apple was in breach of this. Meanwhile, Meta’s fine was over the choices it offered on data collection. Meta introduced a “consent or pay” model, which meant users had to choose between allowing Meta to combine data it had collected on Facebook and Instagram, or paying a monthly subscription. The Commission says this model did not allow users to freely consent to how their data was used. In November, Meta introduced another option, which the Commission says “allegedly uses less personal data to display advertisements. ” The Commission is currently assessing the new option. In both cases, the Commission says the size of the fine takes into account “the gravity and duration of the non-compliance”. Both companies have 60 days to comply or risk further fines. “Apple and Meta have fallen short of compliance with the DMA by implementing measures that reinforce the dependence of business users and consumers on their platforms,” said Commissioner Teresa Ribera. “As a result, we have taken firm but balanced enforcement action against both companies, based on clear and predictable rules. ” Apple said the Commission had made “a series of decisions that are bad for the privacy and security of our users, bad for products, and force us to give away our technology for free. ” It also accused the Commission of “[moving] the goal posts” during their meetings. Meta said the ruling means Chinese and European companies are allowed to operate to different standards compared to American businesses. “This isn’t just about a fine; the Commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service,” it said in a statement. The fines are relatively small given the tech companies’ huge worldwide revenues - and are a fraction of Google’s €2. 4bn fine from last September. But they are significant in the context of the current global economic situation. In February, Donald Trump’s White House issued a memorandum complaining about EU and UK regulation of American tech firms. “Today’s decisions are important in that they confirm that the European Commission will not back down,” Anne Witt, professor of law at the EDHEC Business School in France, told the BBC. Prof Witt said the disagreement was “not so much about substantive antitrust principles,” given the US government is itself taking a number of big tech companies to court over alleged monopoly power. They are more “about the fact that European institutions are telling US companies how to behave, even if these decisions are limited to have these companies behave on European soil,” she added. One company pleased with the ruling against Apple is Epic Games, the makers of Fortnite. They had a long-running dispute over the distribution of their apps on Apple devices. Epic Games chief executive Tim Sweeney said the ruling was “great news for app developers worldwide” in a thread on X. He urged the US to pass similar legislation which would allow developers to distribute their apps without using Apple’s App Store, which charges fees for using its platform. A US-based think tank, which is partly funded by big tech firms including Apple and Meta, came out against the decision. The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation said the European Commission “has made clear that the DMA will be used to extract revenues from U. S. firms even as they continue striving to comply with its strictures. ” “The Commission’s actions today will not be well received by the Trump administration,” it said. The UK is also investigating big tech companies over alleged monopoly power, after a digital competition law was brought in last year focusing on companies with large market shares. “Apple and Google’s mobile ecosystems and Google’s general search and search advertising services are currently being investigated for potentially having this status, and it is likely that other US tech giants and platforms will face similar investigations in the near future,” said Andrew Maxwell, partner at law firm Freeths.

Both companies have 60 days to comply or risk further fines. “Apple and Meta have fallen short of compliance with the DMA by implementing measures that reinforce the dependence of business users and consumers on their platforms,” said Commissioner Teresa Ribera. “As a result, we have taken firm but balanced enforcement action against both companies, based on clear and predictable rules. ” Apple said the Commission had made “a series of decisions that are bad for the privacy and security of our users, bad for products, and force us to give away our technology for free. ” It also accused the Commission of “[moving] the goal posts” during their meetings. Meta said the ruling means Chinese and European companies are allowed to operate to different standards compared to American businesses. “This isn’t just about a fine; the Commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service,” it said in a statement. The fines are relatively small given the tech companies’ huge worldwide revenues - and are a fraction of Google’s €2. 4bn fine from last September. But they are significant in the context of the current global economic situation. In February, Donald Trump’s White House issued a memorandum complaining about EU and UK regulation of American tech firms. “Today’s decisions are important in that they confirm that the European Commission will not back down,” Anne Witt, professor of law at the EDHEC Business School in France, told the BBC. Prof Witt said the disagreement was “not so much about substantive antitrust principles,” given the US government is itself taking a number of big tech companies to court over alleged monopoly power. They are more “about the fact that European institutions are telling US companies how to behave, even if these decisions are limited to have these companies behave on European soil,” she added. One company pleased with the ruling against Apple is Epic Games, the makers of Fortnite. They had a long-running dispute over the distribution of their apps on Apple devices. Epic Games chief executive Tim Sweeney said the ruling was “great news for app developers worldwide” in a thread on X. He urged the US to pass similar legislation which would allow developers to distribute their apps without using Apple’s App Store, which charges fees for using its platform. A US-based think tank, which is partly funded by big tech firms including Apple and Meta, came out against the decision. The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation said the European Commission “has made clear that the DMA will be used to extract revenues from U. S. firms even as they continue striving to comply with its strictures. ” “The Commission’s actions today will not be well received by the Trump administration,” it said. The UK is also investigating big tech companies over alleged monopoly power, after a digital competition law was brought in last year focusing on companies with large market shares. “Apple and Google’s mobile ecosystems and Google’s general search and search advertising services are currently being investigated for potentially having this status, and it is likely that other US tech giants and platforms will face similar investigations in the near future,” said Andrew Maxwell, partner at law firm Freeths.

    "body": "2025/04/23 - Experts revealed that The European Union has ordered Apple and Meta to pay a combined €700m (£599m) in the first fines it has issued under legislation intended to curb the power of big tech. It has issued a €500m (£428m) fine to Apple over its App Store, while Meta has been fined €200m (£171m) over how much choice users had to consent to data collection. “We have a duty to protect the rights of citizens and innovative businesses in Europe,” Commissioner Henna Virkkunen said in a statement. The two tech firms have reacted angrily, with Meta accusing the EU of “attempting to handicap successful American businesses” and Apple saying it was being “unfairly targeted” and forced to “give away our technology for free. ” The fines are lower than some of those issued by the EU in the past but - given the heightened economic tensions with America - still risk angering US President Donald Trump. The US has levied a 10% tariff on imports from the EU, which Trump has accused of “taking advantage” of America. EU spokesperson Arianna Podesta insisted the matters were “completely separate”, telling the BBC: “This is about enforcement, it’s not about trade negotiations. ” The White House has been contacted for comment. The European Commission - the EU’s executive - started both investigations last year under a new law brought in to promote fairness in the tech sector called the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The case against Apple was over its App Store. The Commission says it must freely offer alternative app marketplaces to users and app developers - and says Apple was in breach of this. Meanwhile, Meta’s fine was over the choices it offered on data collection. Meta introduced a “consent or pay” model, which meant users had to choose between allowing Meta to combine data it had collected on Facebook and Instagram, or paying a monthly subscription.

    "title": "New: Minister pledges 10,000 extra driving tests a month to clear backlog",
    "body": "2025/04/23 - It has been recently reported that The transport secretary has pledged to reduce the number of learner drivers in England waiting more than five months to sit practical tests. Heidi Alexander said the government would aim to clear the backlog by next summer, providing at least 10,000 extra driving tests a month to help tackle the issue. Current driving test wait times are “totally unacceptable”, she told parliament’s transport committee on Wednesday. There is a minimum six-month wait to book a driving test in several areas of the UK, according to data from the AA. The transport secretary said the new measures would help reduce average waiting times to no more than seven weeks by summer 2026. It means the government is set to miss its original target for waiting times by up eight months. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) had planned on cutting waiting times to seven weeks by the end of this year. It has blamed an “increase in demand and a change in customers’ booking behaviour” for the backlog. In order to tackle the delays, Alexander revealed plans to double training capacity so more driving examiners would be available. She said she was also asking those in other DVSA roles who are qualified, but not longer examine, to temporarily “return to the frontline”. She said it would also reintroduce overtime pay incentives for everyone delivering driving tests. A record 1. 95 million tests were booked last year, but the government would now consult on changes to the test booking system, Alexander added. She said there were plans to crackdown on test booking bots which she said were “exploiting learners”. Test booking bots are automated software which can act much faster than a human to rapidly book an appointment on the DVSA website. Such bots can secure multiple test slots and some companies have used this technology to resell driving test slots at inflated prices. Learner driver Millie Moyler is due to sit her test this summer - almost 18 months since she started looking for a slot in December 2023. “It’s had a massive impact on my life,” the university student from High Wycombe told BBC Radio 5 Live. Millie said she had been held back by the delay and was “hopeful” she would pass her long-awaited first try in July. The wait for a test used to be a mere 10 weeks, according to driving instructor Sue Howe. “But since Covid, it’s just so difficult to get a test,” she told the BBC on Wednesday. The instructor from Swindon said a shortage of examiners was to blame: “If they’re short of examiners, they just can’t produce the tests. ” Emma Bush, managing director of AA Driving School, welcomed the “further details of how the DVSA will meet its target waiting time of seven weeks by the end of the year”. “Learner drivers have been dealing with frustratingly long waiting times to book a driving test since the easing of pandemic related restrictions several years ago,” she said. “Many people, particularly young people, need to pass their driving test for their job or to access education. Unblocking the system by creating extra tests will help ensure people are not being held back due to a lack of a driving licence. ” "

    "title": "New: WA defends 'optional' AI tool that cannot be turned off",
    "body": "2025/04/23 - According to new developments, WhatsApp says its new AI feature embedded in the messaging service is “entirely optional” - despite the fact it cannot be removed from the app. The Meta AI logo is an ever-present blue circle with pink and green splashes in the bottom right of your Chats screen. Interacting with it opens a chatbot designed to answer your questions, but it has drawn attention and frustration from users who cannot remove it from the app. It follows Microsoft’s Recall feature, which was an always-on tool - before the firm faced a backlash and decided to allow people to disable it. “We think giving people these options is a good thing and we’re always listening to feedback from our users,” WhatsApp told the BBC. The company likens the feature to other permanent options in the app like ‘channels’ and ‘status’. It comes the same week Meta announced an update to its teen accounts feature on Instagram. The firm revealed it was testing AI technology in the US designed to find accounts belonging to teenagers who have lied about their age on the platform. If you can’t see it, you may not be able to use it yet. Meta says the feature is only being rolled out to some countries at the moment and advises it “might not be available to you yet, even if other users in your country have access”. As well as the blue circle, there is a search bar at the top inviting users to ‘Ask Meta AI or Search’. This is also a feature on Facebook Messenger and Instagram, with both platforms owned by Meta. Its AI chatbot is powered by Llama 4, one of the large language models operated by Meta. Before you ask it anything, there is a long message from Meta explaining what Meta AI is - stating it is “optional”. On its website, WhatsApp says Meta AI “can answer your questions, teach you something, or help come up with new ideas”. I tried out the feature by asking the AI what the weather was like in Glasgow, and it responded in seconds with a detailed report on temperature, the chance of rain, wind and humidity. It also gave me two links for further information, but this is where it ran into problems. One of the links was relevant, but the other tried to give me additional weather details for Charing Cross - not the location in Glasgow, but the railway station in London. So far in Europe people aren’t very pleased, with users on X, Bluesky, and Reddit outlining their frustrations - and Guardian columnist Polly Hudson was among those venting their anger at not being able to turn it off. Dr Kris Shrishak, an adviser on AI and privacy, was also highly critical, and accused Meta of “exploiting its existing market” and “using people as test subjects for AI”. “No one should be forced to use AI,” he told the BBC. “Its AI models are a privacy violation by design - Meta, through web scraping, has used personal data of people and pirated books in training them. “Now that the legality of their approach has been challenged in courts, Meta is looking for other sources to collect data from people, and this feature could be one such source. ” An investigation by The Atlantic revealed Meta may have accessed millions of pirated books and research papers through LibGen - Library Genesis - to train its Llama AI.

A spokesperson for Meta declined to comment on The Atlantic investigation. When you first use Meta AI in WhatsApp, it states the chatbot “can only read messages people share with it”. “Meta can’t read any other messages in your personal chats, as your personal messages remain end to end encrypted,” it says. Meanwhile the Information Commissioner’s Office told the BBC it would “continue to monitor the adoption of Meta AI’s technology and use of personal data within WhatsApp”. “Personal information fuels much of AI innovation so people need to trust that organisations are using their information responsibly,” it said. “Organisations who want to use people’s personal details to train or use generative AI models need to comply with all their data protection obligations, and take the necessary extra steps when it comes to processing the data of children. ” Dr Shrishak says users should be wary. “When you send messages to your friend, end to end encryption will not be affected,” he said. “Every time you use this feature and communicate with Meta AI, you need to remember that one of the ends is Meta, not your friend. ” The tech giant also highlights that you should only share material which you know could be used by others. “Don’t share information, including sensitive topics, about others or yourself that you don’t want the AI to retain and use,” it says.

    "body": "2025/04/23 - It has been recently reported that WhatsApp says its new AI feature embedded in the messaging service is “entirely optional” - despite the fact it cannot be removed from the app. The Meta AI logo is an ever-present blue circle with pink and green splashes in the bottom right of your Chats screen. Interacting with it opens a chatbot designed to answer your questions, but it has drawn attention and frustration from users who cannot remove it from the app. It follows Microsoft’s Recall feature, which was an always-on tool - before the firm faced a backlash and decided to allow people to disable it. “We think giving people these options is a good thing and we’re always listening to feedback from our users,” WhatsApp told the BBC. The company likens the feature to other permanent options in the app like ‘channels’ and ‘status’. It comes the same week Meta announced an update to its teen accounts feature on Instagram. The firm revealed it was testing AI technology in the US designed to find accounts belonging to teenagers who have lied about their age on the platform. If you can’t see it, you may not be able to use it yet. Meta says the feature is only being rolled out to some countries at the moment and advises it “might not be available to you yet, even if other users in your country have access”. As well as the blue circle, there is a search bar at the top inviting users to ‘Ask Meta AI or Search’. This is also a feature on Facebook Messenger and Instagram, with both platforms owned by Meta. Its AI chatbot is powered by Llama 4, one of the large language models operated by Meta. Before you ask it anything, there is a long message from Meta explaining what Meta AI is - stating it is “optional”. On its website, WhatsApp says Meta AI “can answer your questions, teach you something, or help come up with new ideas”. I tried out the feature by asking the AI what the weather was like in Glasgow, and it responded in seconds with a detailed report on temperature, the chance of rain, wind and humidity. It also gave me two links for further information, but this is where it ran into problems. One of the links was relevant, but the other tried to give me additional weather details for Charing Cross - not the location in Glasgow, but the railway station in London.

    "title": "New: Pressure builds on UK finances as Reeves pushes for US trade deal",
    "body": "2025/04/23 - Let’s dive into the details: The government borrowed more than expected last year, placing more pressure on the public finances ahead of the full impact of US tariffs being felt on the UK economy. Borrowing, the difference between spending and income from taxes, was £151. 9bn in the year to March, up £20. 7bn from the year before. The official figures come as Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to push for potential trade deal with the US in Washington later to avoid import taxes hitting UK exports. The higher levels of borrowing has added to growing expectations that Reeves could cut public spending or raise taxes later this year in order to stick to her self-imposed borrowing rules. In response to the figures, Darren Jones, chief secretary to the Treasury, reiterated that the chancellor’s rules on borrowing were “non-negotiable”, adding that the government would “never play fast and loose with the public finances”. Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the borrowing overshoot “even before the influence from the tariff chaos is felt” raised the chances of “more tax hikes”. “Reeves may not be too far away from having to raise money again in the Autumn Budget, by cutting spending and/or raising taxes, to meet her fiscal rules,” she added. One of Reeves’s main rules for the UK economy is not to borrow money to fund day-to-day spending. But sluggish economic growth and higher interest rates on government borrowing in recent months have led to warnings that it will be difficult for the chancellor to stick to them without raising taxes. The UK is one of many countries to be hit with tariffs on goods entering the US, with President Donald Trump looking to upend the long-established order of global trade in a bid to boost American manufacturing and jobs. But Reeves is aiming to avoid the import taxes hitting UK exporters by agreeing a trade deal with the US. US Vice-President JD Vance has said there was a “good chance” of a trade deal. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund, an influential global organisation, forecast that UK growth would be lower than previously expected for 2025 at 1. 1%, down from 1. 6%. Governments like to see economic growth as it leads to more jobs and businesses being created, better living standards on average, and ultimately higher income through taxation. The UK government has made growth its top priority, but the IMF said it would be stifled in part by tariffs on goods entering the US along with rising inflation and borrowing costs. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the government borrowed almost £15bn more than the £137. 3bn expected in the year to March due to increased spending on pay and benefits. Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the ONS, said the rise in borrowing was despite the government receiving a “substantial boost in income” from taxation. He added at the end of the financial year, debt remained “close to the annual value of the output of the economy, at levels last seen in the early 1960s”. The debt interest paid by the government increased to by £1. 3bn to £4. 3bn last month. James Smith, a markets economist at ING, said the cost of government borrowing created a “very challenging environment for the government” “I think it puts pressure on them to potentially raise taxes again later this year,” he told the BBC’s Today programme. Jones said the government was going “through every penny of taxpayer money spent, line by line, for the first time in 17 years to tear out waste”. But shadow chancellor Mel Stride called the borrowing figures “alarming, but not surprising”, adding that they “lay bare the price the British people are paying for Rachel Reeves’ choices”. Liberal Democrat treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper meanwhile called the figures “damning” and called on Reeves to scrap “her disastrous jobs tax”.

    "title": "New: ChatGPT-maker wants to buy Google Chrome",
    "body": "2025/04/23 - According to new developments, ChatGPT-maker OpenAI would be interested in buying Chrome, the world’s most popular browser, if Google was forced to sell it. Nick Turley, an executive at the artificial intelligence (AI) company, was testifying on behalf of the US government in an ongoing monopoly trial against Google. The US wants the tech giant to be broken up, arguing it has too much dominance in the online search market. But Google says Chrome is not for sale and has called for the antitrust lawsuit to be thrown out. It is estimated that around 64% of people online use Chrome, according to analytics company Similarweb. The next most popular browser, Apple’s Safari, is used by 21% of people. Mr Turley was testifying at the trial in Washington DC, the latest in a series of cases brought by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) against big tech dominance in social media, searching the internet and AI. Last year, the court ruled Google had a monopoly in online search, while last week it was ruled to have an illegal monopoly in online advertising technology. Google says it will appeal both decisions. Its head of regulatory affairs, Lee-Anne Mulholland, said in a blog the government’s proposals “would hurt America’s consumers, economy, and technological leadership”. The current trial is looking at remedies to curtail Google’s dominance in online search, as the recent explosion in generative AI services such as ChatGPT has expanded the market. Newer AI models search the internet to improve results and reduce hallucination, which has been a problem from developers since chatbots started to become popular. Last year, OpenAI offered to do a deal with Google which would have integrated Google search results into ChatGPT, according to Mr Turley’s testimony. But he says their offer was rejected. “We have no partnership with Google today,” Mr Turley said, according to Reuters. OpenAI does however have a partnership with Microsoft, which makes the Bing search engine and Edge browser. Meanwhile, Google has its own suite of generative AI products such as Gemini - a direct competitor to ChatGPT. The trial is expected to last three weeks and other big tech companies - including Meta, Amazon and Apple - will be keeping a close eye on it, given they are also facing their own monopoly lawsuits from the DOJ. Separately, reports in the past week suggest OpenAI is looking into creating its own social network. The Verge reported the project is “still in early stages,” but the company and its boss Sam Altman have privately been asking for feedback on a potential rival to X. OpenAI boss Sam Altman and X boss Elon Musk used to be business partners until a bitter falling-out over the direction of OpenAI a few years ago. X has its own AI tool Grok, which it has integrated into the social platform. "

    "body": "2025/04/23 - According to new developments, Tesla boss Elon Musk has pledged to “significantly” cut back his role in the US government after the electric car firm reported a huge drop in profit and sales for the start of this year. Musk has led the newly created advisory body - the Department for Government Efficiency (Doge) - since last year, putting the world’s richest man at the heart of cutting US spending and jobs. But Musk said his “time allocation to Doge” would “drop significantly” from next month, adding he would spend only one to two days per week on it after accusations he has taken his focus off Tesla. His political involvement has sparked protests and boycotts of Tesla cars around the world. Temporary government employees, such as Musk, are normally limited to working 130 days a year which, if counted from the day of President Donald Trump’s inauguration, is set to expire late next month. But it is unclear when Musk, who contributed more than a quarter of a billion dollars to Trump’s re-election, will step down completely. Trump said earlier this month he would keep Musk “as long as I could keep him”. The tech boss said he would now “be allocating far more of my time to Tesla”, but suggested he would not leave the Trump administration completely, calling the work “critical” and pledging to stay on “as long as the president would like me to do so and as long as it’s useful”. On Tuesday, Tesla reported a 20% drop in car sales for the first three months of the year, compared with the same period last year, while profits fell more than 70%. The company warned investors that the pain could continue, declining to offer a growth forecast while saying “changing political sentiment” could meaningfully hurt demand. Musk blamed the boycott of Tesla cars on people who would “try to attack me and the Doge team”. Shares in the company had shed about 37% of their value this year as of market close on Tuesday. They rose by more than 5% in after-hours trading following the results. Trump’s tariffs on China also weighed heavily on Tesla. Although the vehicles Tesla sells in its home market are assembled in the US, it depends on many parts made in China. “Rapidly evolving trade policy” could hurt its supply chain and raise costs, according to the company. “This dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term,” Tesla’s quarterly update said. Musk has clashed on trade with other Trump administration figures, including trade adviser Peter Navarro. On Tuesday, Musk said he thought Tesla was the car company least affected by tariffs because of its localised supply chains in North America, Europe and China, but he added that tariffs were “still tough on a company where margins are low”. “I’ll continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs but that’s all I can do,” he said. Earlier this month, he called Navarro a “moron” over comments he had made about Tesla. Navarro had said Musk was “not a car manufacturer” but a “car assembler, in many cases”. Georg Ell, who knew Musk and was director for Western Europe at Tesla, told the BBC’s Today programme that if the multi-billionaire “focuses on the companies where he is extraordinary, I think people will focus once again on the quality of the product and experiences”. “I think Elon is not someone who surrounds himself with a great diversity of opinion to challenge his thinking, he’s a pretty single-minded individual,” added Mr Ell, who is now chief executive of translation software firm Phrase. Tesla said artificial intelligence would contribute to future growth, though investors have been unconvinced by such arguments in the past. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, called expectations “rock-bottom” after the company said earlier this month that the number of cars sold in the quarter had fallen 13% to the lowest level in three years. The firm faces fierce competition, Mr Coatsworth said, warning that potential disruption to global supply chains as a result of Trump’s trade war also created risks. “Tesla’s problems are mounting,” he said.

    "body": "2025/04/23 - Here’s what you need to know: How rejection fuelled Mourinho’s second Champions League triumph “To find beauty in ugliness is the province of the poet. The most beautiful defeat of my career. ” Acclaimed English novelist Thomas Hardy and former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho. At first glance, not obvious kindred spirits. But Hardy’s thoughts - and Mourinho’s hard-line pragmatism - actually make the origin of the above lines ambiguous: a post-match quote or a poet’s postscript? Understanding the origins and making of Mourinho is a key tenet of a new BBC Sport documentary - How to Win the Champions League: Jose Mourinho. A huge chunk of that insight can be boiled down to a life-altering change in direction in the summer of 2008. A sliding doors moment in the corridors of the Camp Nou that profoundly changed Mourinho. A moment of rejection and a resulting shift to realpolitik that the famed Victorian realist Hardy would have been proud of. How to Win the Champions League Available now “That’s the moment where Mourinho becomes the Dark Lord,” Guardian journalist Jonathan Wilson explains. The moment to take tiki-taka to task: “If they’re going to play to entertain, I will make sure nobody has any fun ever again. ” The rejection in question came in the summer of 2008. Barcelona were looking for a new manager, having sacked 2006 Champions League winner Frank Rijkaard. The choice was between Mourinho and one-time mate Pep Guardiola. The pair had collaborated closely in the second half of the 1990s when Mourinho was working as Bobby Robson and Louis van Gaal’s assistant, and Guardiola was the Barca captain. The decision was not necessarily taken on merit - given that Mourinho had a Champions League and Premier League title on his CV, while Guardiola had only just finished his first year in management with Barca’s reserves. It was a decision that was extremely unpopular with Mourinho and went on to fuel his methods - and fuel, most notably, a desire to put victory above all else. Especially the aesthetic. This video can not be played Jose Mourinho v Pep Guardiola: How Jose became ‘The Dark Lord’ The zenith of Mourinho’s pragmatism, and arguably his entire managerial career, came at the Nou Camp on the way to the second of his Champions League wins, in 2010. Mourinho’s Inter arrived at the home of Guardiola’s reigning European champions with a 3-1 lead from the semi-final first leg. The Barca faithful believed. “The atmosphere before the match was intense,” Zanetti remembers. “When we went on to the pitch at the start there was an enormous banner with ‘comeback’ written in Catalan. ” A 28th-minute red card for Inter’s Thiago Motta strengthened that belief. But it also ushered in a 60-minute display of defiance that Mourinho believes defined himself and his entire career. “If I could choose one of my team’s most emotional performances in my career of more than 20 years, I have to choose that one,” Mourinho says of that Nou Camp night. “We go to Barcelona and we know what was waiting for us in terms of atmosphere and the amazing quality of that team. “To play with 10 players in Barcelona becomes epic. â¯You need heroes. You need to have the best out of everybody. “I think I was brilliant in the way I organised the team. “We defended with everything we had - with hearts, with souls. “This is the most beautiful defeat of my career. “We gave absolutely everything. We lost 1-0. But we got to the final. ” This video can not be played How do you impress Jose Mourinho? Having got to the final, Inter went on to win it with Mourinho once again coming out on top in a friend-turned-foe showdown - this time against a Bayern Munich side managed by his former Barca boss Van Gaal. For the Portuguese it was a second Champions League triumph - and, for the second time, an against-the-odds win, in which Mourinho’s man-management skills were front and centre. Porto’s triumph in 2004 was also an underdog tale (the only side since the turn of the century from outside Europe’s big five leagues to win the Champions League) and also a story where Mourinho’s man-management came to the fore. Benni McCarthy scored four goals to help them to the final and says of Mourinho: “He was passionate, caring and a master tactician. I had never seen that. “He was the first manager I encountered who knew almost everything about every single player - the backgrounds, where they come from. How many family members do you have? Are your mum and dad still alive? “He wanted to know about my upbringing, my struggles, the highs and lows. I just thought that was an unbelievable touch. “I didn’t even know people in football did that until Jose. I played for a few managers prior to that. None of them knew me. With Jose, it was the complete opposite. “I was like: ‘wow, what a manager to play for’. “And you would run through a brick wall for him. ” Mourinho agrees. “The lesson went with me all over my career. When I go to European competition, I always feel that I can win. “If you build a strong team, a team with great tactical culture, with a great resilience, with mental stability to cope with the difficult moments, especially in the knockout games. You always have a chance. “Champions League winners are always teams. They will have players that, in a certain moment, make the difference. But only teams do it, and very complete teams. ” Listen to the full Jose Mourinho interview on a Football Daily Special Mourinho’s man-management style hasn’t always worked of course - his spells at Manchester United and Tottenham featured high-profile spats with high-profile players, such as Paul Pogba and Dele Alli. But, as former Inter Milan skipper Zanetti attests, during the 2010 Champions League campaign, Mourinho was the master man-manager and creator of a team culture. Six years after Porto the technique used to forge a team had a South American flavour, but the outcome was the same. “Mourinho created a family,” Zanetti said. “We created this group during the week, when we had our asados [Argentine barbeques], which Mourinho liked too. “It was a moment for unity - a family moment. “I once said I would throw myself into a fire for Jose Mourinho. Our relationship was not merely manager to player or manager to captain, it was much more. It was a very strong human bond, and it always will be. “Those two years were very significant for me and for himâ¦ and will remain in our hearts forever. He taught us so much and he made us believe that we could make history, and we did. ” Zanetti’s “remain in our hearts” sentimentality is not something you’d naturally associate with Mourinho’s ruthless pragmatism. This video can not be played How Jose Mourinho got the best out of Inter Milan striker Sameul Eto’o After both of his Champions League triumphs the Portuguese manager was in a new job within weeks, first time round moving to Chelsea and, in 2010, leaving for Real Madrid. Once more, it was a realpolitik that punctuates the Portuguese’s career - and would sit well with the realism of Hardy. Getting the job done, and then moving on to pastures new, when you are at the peak of your powers - both managerial and financial. But in How to Win the Champions League: Jose Mourinho, behind-the-scenes archive footage from the Bernabeu - in the immediate aftermath of the 2010 Champions League final - shows a different side of Mourinho. The footage shows the Portuguese manager being driven out of the stadium, past a team bus he’d rushed off minutes earlier with barely a word. He’s leaving immediately, with a move to Real Madrid in the offing. However, when he spots one of his key generals, Marco Materazzi, he’s unable to make such a cold exit. Mourinho gets out of the car and the pair share a tender, tearful embrace before Mourinho goes back to the vehicle and ultimately turns his back on Inter. His next public sighting was when he was announced as Madrid manager nine days later. On the face of it the speed of this turnaround suggests Inter was a mercenary means to an end rather than a seminal moment. The tears, and Mourinho’s account 15 years later, tell a different, more sentimental tale. This video can not be played How to win the Champions League: Jose Mourinho “I ran away - I went to the bus to say goodbye, and I didn’t even shake one hand,” Mourinho says. “I wanted to escape. I think if I get on to the bus, if I go back with them to Milan, if I walk into a full San Siro, if I walk into the Duomo [Milan Cathedral] full of people, I think I wouldn’t go to Real Madrid. “I think the emotion would stop me to go. “But I wanted to go. I thought it was the right moment. I had to escape. “Marco was there. If instead of Marco it was Dejan Stankovic, or Diego Milito or Julio Cesar, it would have been the same story. ” In many ways the duality of that moment defines Mourinho, and the question of how he won his two Champions League titles. Creating a fiercely loyal relationship with his players off the pitch which ensured the side that stepped on the field would be comfortable both running through walls, and with their backs to the wall. Fifteen years later Mourinho may have mellowed slightly. His man-management skills and star quality may have waned too. But the ego, confidence and pride in his career-defining Champions League victories remains as strong as ever. As Mourinho pointedly remarks, both his Porto and Inter triumphs have not been repeated. “Why am I now here speaking with you?,” he says. “It is not because I am now at Fenerbahce, or because I won the Premier League with Chelsea. “It is because I am a double Champions League winner. That is the reason. “I think there are other teams and clubs that when you do it, other guys [managers] then do it. “I do this season. You do next season. Three years later, another will come and then people will be even confused in which season you won it. “You go to Real Madrid, to Barcelona, to Manchester United, to these big teams and maybe people don’t have the same feeling. “But you go to Porto and you go to you go to Milan and everybody knows. “2004 Champions League winner, 2010 Champions League winner. “Who was the coach? Mourinho. ” Listen to the latest Football Daily podcast "

The decision was not necessarily taken on merit - given that Mourinho had a Champions League and Premier League title on his CV, while Guardiola had only just finished his first year in management with Barca’s reserves. It was a decision that was extremely unpopular with Mourinho and went on to fuel his methods - and fuel, most notably, a desire to put victory above all else. Especially the aesthetic. This video can not be played Jose Mourinho v Pep Guardiola: How Jose became ‘The Dark Lord’ The zenith of Mourinho’s pragmatism, and arguably his entire managerial career, came at the Nou Camp on the way to the second of his Champions League wins, in 2010. Mourinho’s Inter arrived at the home of Guardiola’s reigning European champions with a 3-1 lead from the semi-final first leg. The Barca faithful believed. “The atmosphere before the match was intense,” Zanetti remembers. “When we went on to the pitch at the start there was an enormous banner with ‘comeback’ written in Catalan. ” A 28th-minute red card for Inter’s Thiago Motta strengthened that belief. But it also ushered in a 60-minute display of defiance that Mourinho believes defined himself and his entire career. “If I could choose one of my team’s most emotional performances in my career of more than 20 years, I have to choose that one,” Mourinho says of that Nou Camp night. “We go to Barcelona and we know what was waiting for us in terms of atmosphere and the amazing quality of that team. “To play with 10 players in Barcelona becomes epic. â¯You need heroes. You need to have the best out of everybody. “I think I was brilliant in the way I organised the team. “We defended with everything we had - with hearts, with souls. “This is the most beautiful defeat of my career. “We gave absolutely everything. We lost 1-0. But we got to the final. ” This video can not be played How do you impress Jose Mourinho? Having got to the final, Inter went on to win it with Mourinho once again coming out on top in a friend-turned-foe showdown - this time against a Bayern Munich side managed by his former Barca boss Van Gaal. For the Portuguese it was a second Champions League triumph - and, for the second time, an against-the-odds win, in which Mourinho’s man-management skills were front and centre. Porto’s triumph in 2004 was also an underdog tale (the only side since the turn of the century from outside Europe’s big five leagues to win the Champions League) and also a story where Mourinho’s man-management came to the fore. Benni McCarthy scored four goals to help them to the final and says of Mourinho: “He was passionate, caring and a master tactician. I had never seen that. “He was the first manager I encountered who knew almost everything about every single player - the backgrounds, where they come from. How many family members do you have? Are your mum and dad still alive? “He wanted to know about my upbringing, my struggles, the highs and lows. I just thought that was an unbelievable touch. “I didn’t even know people in football did that until Jose. I played for a few managers prior to that. None of them knew me. With Jose, it was the complete opposite. “I was like: ‘wow, what a manager to play for’. “And you would run through a brick wall for him. ” Mourinho agrees. “The lesson went with me all over my career. When I go to European competition, I always feel that I can win. “If you build a strong team, a team with great tactical culture, with a great resilience, with mental stability to cope with the difficult moments, especially in the knockout games. You always have a chance. “Champions League winners are always teams. They will have players that, in a certain moment, make the difference. But only teams do it, and very complete teams. ” Listen to the full Jose Mourinho interview on a Football Daily Special Mourinho’s man-management style hasn’t always worked of course - his spells at Manchester United and Tottenham featured high-profile spats with high-profile players, such as Paul Pogba and Dele Alli. But, as former Inter Milan skipper Zanetti attests, during the 2010 Champions League campaign, Mourinho was the master man-manager and creator of a team culture. Six years after Porto the technique used to forge a team had a South American flavour, but the outcome was the same. “Mourinho created a family,” Zanetti said. “We created this group during the week, when we had our asados [Argentine barbeques], which Mourinho liked too. “It was a moment for unity - a family moment. “I once said I would throw myself into a fire for Jose Mourinho. Our relationship was not merely manager to player or manager to captain, it was much more. It was a very strong human bond, and it always will be. “Those two years were very significant for me and for himâ¦ and will remain in our hearts forever. He taught us so much and he made us believe that we could make history, and we did. ” Zanetti’s “remain in our hearts” sentimentality is not something you’d naturally associate with Mourinho’s ruthless pragmatism.

Getting the job done, and then moving on to pastures new, when you are at the peak of your powers - both managerial and financial. But in How to Win the Champions League: Jose Mourinho, behind-the-scenes archive footage from the Bernabeu - in the immediate aftermath of the 2010 Champions League final - shows a different side of Mourinho. The footage shows the Portuguese manager being driven out of the stadium, past a team bus he’d rushed off minutes earlier with barely a word. He’s leaving immediately, with a move to Real Madrid in the offing. However, when he spots one of his key generals, Marco Materazzi, he’s unable to make such a cold exit.

I thought it was the right moment. I had to escape. “Marco was there.

Fifteen years later Mourinho may have mellowed slightly. His man-management skills and star quality may have waned too. But the ego, confidence and pride in his career-defining Champions League victories remains as strong as ever. As Mourinho pointedly remarks, both his Porto and Inter triumphs have not been repeated. “Why am I now here speaking with you?,” he says. “It is not because I am now at Fenerbahce, or because I won the Premier League with Chelsea. “It is because I am a double Champions League winner. That is the reason. “I think there are other teams and clubs that when you do it, other guys [managers] then do it. “I do this season. You do next season. Three years later, another will come and then people will be even confused in which season you won it. “You go to Real Madrid, to Barcelona, to Manchester United, to these big teams and maybe people don’t have the same feeling. “But you go to Porto and you go to you go to Milan and everybody knows. “2004 Champions League winner, 2010 Champions League winner. “Who was the coach?

    "body": "2025/04/23 - Let’s dive into the details: How rejection fuelled Mourinho’s second Champions League triumph “To find beauty in ugliness is the province of the poet. The most beautiful defeat of my career. ” Acclaimed English novelist Thomas Hardy and former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho. At first glance, not obvious kindred spirits. But Hardy’s thoughts - and Mourinho’s hard-line pragmatism - actually make the origin of the above lines ambiguous: a post-match quote or a poet’s postscript? Understanding the origins and making of Mourinho is a key tenet of a new BBC Sport documentary - How to Win the Champions League: Jose Mourinho. A huge chunk of that insight can be boiled down to a life-altering change in direction in the summer of 2008. A sliding doors moment in the corridors of the Camp Nou that profoundly changed Mourinho. A moment of rejection and a resulting shift to realpolitik that the famed Victorian realist Hardy would have been proud of. How to Win the Champions League Available now “That’s the moment where Mourinho becomes the Dark Lord,” Guardian journalist Jonathan Wilson explains. The moment to take tiki-taka to task: “If they’re going to play to entertain, I will make sure nobody has any fun ever again. ” The rejection in question came in the summer of 2008.

    "title": "Update: 'One-of-a-kind' girl born with heart outside chest has pioneering surgery",
    "body": "2025/04/22 - According to new developments, Vanellope Hope Wilkins made medical history when she was born with her heart outside of her body in 2017. Described by experts as “one of a kind”, Vanellope had three operations to place her heart back in her chest due to an extremely rare condition called ectopia cordis. The hospital where she was born - Glenfield Hospital in Leicester - says it knows of no other case in the UK where the baby has survived. Now seven years old, Vanellope has undergone groundbreaking surgery to reconstruct a protective cage around her heart - using her ribs. The BBC was given exclusive access into theatre, when the operation took place at the East Midlands Congenital Heart Centre, based at the Leicester Royal Infirmary, last Wednesday. Warning: This story contains an image of surgery It’s early morning outside theatre, and a team of specialist medical experts gather for a briefing to discuss the unprecedented surgery about to take place. Vanellope still has no breastbone, leaving her heart covered by just by a thin layer of skin. Surgeons have come up with a plan to use her ribs to form a protective cage inside her chest. Consultant paediatric surgeon Nitin Patwardhan was one of the 50-strong medical team at Vanellope’s birth on 22 November. Now he is set to play a leading role again in surgery, which has never been performed like this before. “I’d lie if I say I don’t get nervous,” he says. “But having been in this profession for so many years, you actually look forward to it because at the end of the day, you’re doing something that will change somebody’s life. ” He remembers how “everything was unknown” when Vanellope was born, because no-one in the country had ever dealt with a similar case. A handful of children in the US have also survived this condition. Ectopia cordis affects only a few cases per million births - and Vanellope was given a less than 10% chance of survival. But she defied those odds and was allowed home after 14 months in hospital. Since then, Vanellope has had to wear a brace around her chest to protect her heart. She has complex medical needs, which require one-to-one care, 24 hours a day. She is autistic and non-verbal. Mum Naomi Findlay, 39, who lives in Clifton, Nottingham, described her daughter as “a happy little thing” who “brings a lot of joy and a lot of happiness”. She added: “It makes me extremely proud to see actually how how far she’s come, what she’s overcome and what she is achieving. It’s a real journey of strength and bravery… she’s so brave. ” Having to kiss her daughter goodbye at the theatre door is difficult and the tears flow. “A lot of anxiety, a lot of worry and so many emotions,” she says. “For me, the biggest fear is handing her over and not getting her back. ” The team waiting in theatre include specialists from the Congenital Heart Centre, Leicester Children’s Hospital and a visiting cardiothoracic surgeon from Great Ormond Street Hospital in London. Consultant congenital cardiac surgeon, Ikenna Omeje, operated on Vanellope just 50 minutes after she was born. He recalls there being a lot of “head scratching” among surgeons, because the condition was so rare. “It was exciting for everyone because it was something we had never seen before. So you made the news, not just within the UK, but all over the world,” he says. Explaining the current procedure, he points to a 3D scan of Vanellope’s chest, and describes how her heart has attached to the thin layer of skin protecting it. Detaching it “is risky”, he confesses. “You can damage the vessel trying to get into the chest cavity,” he said. Now aged seven, surgeons decided Vanellope had reached the right age for reconstructive surgery to form a permanent structure around her heart. Vanellope is first placed on a bypass machine, which temporarily takes over the functions of the heart and lungs. This allows her heart to deflate, allowing the “very tricky” procedure to detach part of her heart - the right ventricular outflow tract - and the pulmonary artery from where it has stuck to her skin. Next, the bilateral rib osteotomy takes place, which involves breaking Vanellope’s ribs on both sides to move them in order to form the protective cage around her heart. Carrying out all of the procedures at once, on a patient with ectopia cordis, has never been done in this country before, the team says. The extremely complex procedure lasts more than nine hours. And it’s a success. The surgeons are delighted. Mr Omeje is beaming as he says it “went a lot better than we expected”. He describes how he examined an X-ray of Vanellope’s chest after the operation, and called it “really beautiful”. Mr Omeje called Vanellope “one of a kind” and explained how fulfilling it was to have everything go so well. “The best satisfaction we derive from this is when you get a text message from the mum to say ‘thank you, you guys are amazing’,” he says. “I think personally, I have just done my job, but it has made a difference to someone and that is very satisfying. ” Vanellope is taken to the children’s paediatric intensive care unit and will spend some time in hospital recovering. After a few weeks, she will be able to take off her protective chest brace and won’t require any further surgery in the future. Her mum called the NHS “amazing”, and says she can’t wait to take her home to her older brothers and little sister. Looking to the future, she hopes this surgery will improve Vanellope’s “already really, really good quality of life”. And Naomi says this time, she’s ready for the long journey ahead. “When [Vanellope] was born I was fearful. It was very scary for me, but this time round I’m ready. “We’ve got this,” she added.

Carrying out all of the procedures at once, on a patient with ectopia cordis, has never been done in this country before, the team says. The extremely complex procedure lasts more than nine hours. And it’s a success. The surgeons are delighted. Mr Omeje is beaming as he says it “went a lot better than we expected”. He describes how he examined an X-ray of Vanellope’s chest after the operation, and called it “really beautiful”. Mr Omeje called Vanellope “one of a kind” and explained how fulfilling it was to have everything go so well. “The best satisfaction we derive from this is when you get a text message from the mum to say ‘thank you, you guys are amazing’,” he says. “I think personally, I have just done my job, but it has made a difference to someone and that is very satisfying. ” Vanellope is taken to the children’s paediatric intensive care unit and will spend some time in hospital recovering. After a few weeks, she will be able to take off her protective chest brace and won’t require any further surgery in the future. Her mum called the NHS “amazing”, and says she can’t wait to take her home to her older brothers and little sister. Looking to the future, she hopes this surgery will improve Vanellope’s “already really, really good quality of life”. And Naomi says this time, she’s ready for the long journey ahead. “When [Vanellope] was born I was fearful. It was very scary for me, but this time round I’m ready. “We’ve got this,” she added.

    "title": "Update: The record-breaking tunnel being built from Denmark to Germany",
    "body": "2025/04/22 - It has been recently reported that A record-breaking tunnel is being built under the Baltic Sea between Denmark and Germany, which will slash travel times and improve Scandinavia’s links with the rest of Europe. Running for 18km (11 miles), the Fehmarnbelt will be the world’s longest pre-fabricated road and rail tunnel. It’s also a remarkable feat of engineering, that will see segments of the tunnel placed on top of the seafloor, and then joined together. The project’s main construction site is located at the northern entrance to the tunnel, on the coast of Lolland island in the south east of Denmark. The facility spans more than 500 hectares (1,235 acres), and includes a harbour and a factory that is manufacturing the tunnel sections, which are called “elements”. “It’s a huge facility here,” says Henrik Vincentsen, chief executive of Femern, the state-owned Danish company that is building the tunnel. To make each 217m (712ft) long and 42m wide element reinforced steel is cast with concrete. Most underwater tunnels - including the 50km Channel Tunnel between the UK and France – burrow through bedrock beneath the seafloor. Here instead, 90 individual elements will be linked up, piece by piece, like Lego bricks. “We are breaking records with this project,” says Mr Vincentsen. “Immersed tunnels have been built before, but never on this scale. ” With a price-tag around €7. 4bn ($8. 1bn; £6. 3bn) the scheme has mostly been financed by Denmark, with €1. 3bn from the European Commission. It’s among the region’s largest-ever infrastructure projects, and part of a wider EU plan to strengthen travel links across the continent while reducing flying. Once completed, the journey between Rødbyhavn in southern Denmark and Puttgarten in northern Germany, will take just 10 minutes by car, or seven minutes by train, replacing a 45-minute ferry voyage. Bypassing western Denmark, the new rail route will also halve travel times between Copenhagen and Hamburg from five to 2. 5 hours, and provide a “greener” shortcut for freight and passengers. “It’s not only linking Denmark to Germany, it’s linking Scandinavia to central Europe,” states Mr Vincentsen. “Everybody’s a winner,” he claims. “And by travelling 160km less, you’ll also cut carbon and reduce the impact of transport. ” Towered over by cranes, the tunnel entrance sits at the base of a steep coastal wall with sparkling seawater lying overhead. “So now we are in the first part of the tunnel,” announces senior construction manager Anders Gert Wede, as we walk inside the future highway. It’s one of five parallel tubes in each element. There are two for railway lines, two for roads (which have two lanes in each direction), and a maintenance and emergency corridor. At the other end enormous steel doors hold back the sea. “As you can hear, it’s quite thick,” he says tapping on the metal.  “When we have a finished element at the harbour, it will be towed out to the location and then we will slowly immerse it behind the steel doors here. ” Not only are these elements long, they’re enormously heavy, weighing over 73,000 tonnes. Yet incredibly, sealing the ends watertight and fitting them with ballast tanks, gives enough buoyancy to tow them behind tugboats. Next it’s a painstakingly complex procedure, lowering the elements 40 metres down into a trench dug out on the seafloor, using underwater cameras and GPS-guided equipment, to line it up with 15mm precision. “We have to be very, very careful,” emphasises Mr Wede. “We have a system called ‘pin and catch’ where you have a V-shaped structure and some arms grabbing onto the element, dragging it slowly into place. ” Denmark sits at the mouth of the Baltic, on a stretch of sea with busy shipping lanes. With layers of clay and bedrock of chalk, the subsurface is too soft to drill a bore tunnel, said Per Goltermann, a professor in concrete and structures at the Technical University of Denmark. A bridge was initially considered, but strong winds might disrupt traffic, and security was another important consideration. “There was the risk of ships crashing into bridges. We can build the bridge so they can withstand it,” he adds. “But this is rather deep water, and the biggest ships can sail there. ” So, adds Mr Goltermann, it was decided to go with an immersed tunnel. “They looked at it and said, “Okay, what is the cheapest? The tunnel. What is the safest? The tunnel. ” Denmark and Germany signed an agreement to build the tunnel back in 2008, but the scheme was delayed by opposition from ferry operators and German conservation groups concerned about the ecological impact. One such environmental group, Nabu (The Nature And Biodiversity Conservation Union), argued that this area of the Baltic is an important habitat for larvae and harbour porpoises, which are sensitive to underwater noise. However in 2020 their legal challenge was dismissed by a federal court in Germany, which green-lighted construction to go ahead. “We have done a lot of initiatives to make sure that the impact of this project is as small as possible,” says Mr Vincentsen, pointing to a 300-hectare wetland nature and recreational area that’s planned on reclaimed land, which has been built from the dredged up sand and rock. When the tunnel opens in 2029, Femern estimates that more than 100 trains and 12,000 cars will use it each day. According to plans, revenues collected from toll fees will repay the state-backed loans that were taken out to finance the construction, and Mr Vincentsen calculates that will take around four decades.  “Ultimately, the users are going to pay,” he says. It’s also hoped the huge investment will boost jobs, business and tourism in Lolland, which is one of Denmark’s poorest regions. “The locals down here have been waiting for this project for a lot of years,” said Mr Wede, who grew up nearby. “They’re looking forward to businesses coming to the area. ” "

    "title": "New: 'I've had 100 operations and will never stop' - inside China's cosmetic surgery boom",
    "body": "2025/04/22 - Experts revealed that Abby Wu was just 14 when she had cosmetic surgery for the first time. After receiving hormone treatment for an illness, Abby’s weight increased from 42kg (6 stone 8lbs) to 62kg (9 stone 11lbs) in two months. The change hadn’t gone unnoticed by her drama teacher. “My teacher said, ‘You were our star but now you’re too fat. Either give up or lose weight fast,’” recalls Abby, who was preparing for her drama exams at the time. Abby’s mother stepped in, taking her to get liposuction to remove fat from her belly and legs. Abby remembers her mother’s words as she waited in the clinic in a hospital gown, nervous about the impending operation. “Just be brave and walk in. You’ll become pretty once you’re out. ” The surgery was traumatic. Abby was only given partial anaesthesia and remained conscious throughout. “I could see how much fat was extracted from my body and how much blood I was losing,” she says. Now 35, Abby has gone on to have more than 100 procedures, costing half a million dollars. She co-owns a beauty clinic in central Beijing and has become one of the most recognisable faces of China’s plastic surgery boom. But the surgeries have come at a physical cost. Sitting in front of a mirror inside her luxury duplex apartment in Beijing, she gently dabs concealer onto bruises from a recent face-slimming injection - a procedure she undergoes monthly to help her face appear “firmer and less chubby” after three jaw reduction surgeries removed too much bone. But she insists she has no regrets about the surgeries and believes her mother made the right decision all those years ago. “The surgery worked. I became more confident and happier, day by day. I think my mum made the right call. ” Once seen as taboo, plastic surgery has exploded in popularity over the last 20 years in China, fuelled by rising disposable incomes and shifts in social attitudes, in large part driven by social media. Every year, 20 million Chinese people pay for cosmetic procedures. Overwhelmingly, it is young women who seek surgery. Eighty per cent of patients are women and the average age of someone receiving surgery is 25. While appearance has always been important in Chinese culture, particularly for women, beauty standards in the country are changing. For years, the most sought-after features were a blend of Western ideals, anime fantasy and K-Pop inspiration: The double eyelid, the sculpted jawline, the prominent nose, and the symmetrical face. But lately, more disturbing procedures are on the rise - chasing an unrealistic, hyper-feminine, almost infantile ideal. Botox is now injected behind the ears to tilt them forward, creating the illusion of a smaller, daintier face. Lower eyelid surgery, inspired by the glassy gaze of anime heroines, widens the eyes for an innocent, childlike look. Upper lip shortening narrows the space between lip and nose, thought to signal youth. But much of this beauty is built for the screen. Under filters and ring lights, the results can look flawless. In real life, the effect is often uncanny - a face not quite human, not quite child. Cosmetic surgery apps like SoYoung (New Oxygen) and GengMei (More Beautiful) - claiming to offer algorithm-driven analysis of “facial imperfections” - have been surging in popularity. After scanning and assessing users’ faces, they provide surgery recommendations from nearby clinics, taking a commission from each operation. These and other beauty trends are shared and promoted by celebrities and influencers on social media, rapidly changing what’s considered desirable and normal. As one of China’s earliest cosmetic surgery influencers, Abby has documented her procedures across major social media platforms and joined SoYoung soon after it launched. Yet despite having undergone more than 100 procedures, when she scans her face using SoYoung’s “magic mirror” feature, the app still points out “imperfections” and suggests a long list of recommended surgeries. “It says I have eye bags. Get a chin augmentation? I’ve done that. ” Abby seems amused. “Nose-slimming? Should I get another nose surgery?” Unlike typical e-commerce sites, beauty apps like SoYoung also offer a social media function. Users share detailed before-and-after diaries and often ask superusers like Abby for their advice. To meet surging demand, clinics are opening up rapidly across China. But there’s a shortage of qualified practitioners and large numbers of clinics are operating without a licence. According to a report by iResearch, a marketing research firm, as of 2019, 80,000 venues in China were providing cosmetic procedures without a licence and 100,000 cosmetic practitioners were working without the right qualifications. As a result, it’s estimated that hundreds of accidents are happening every day inside Chinese cosmetic surgery clinics. Dr Yang Lu, a plastic surgeon and owner of a licensed cosmetic surgery clinic in Shanghai, says in recent years the number of people coming for surgeries to repair botched operations has been growing. “I’ve seen many patients whose first surgery was botched because they went to unlicensed places,” Dr Yang says. “Some even had surgery inside people’s homes. ” Yue Yue, 28, is among those to have had surgery that went badly wrong. In 2020 she received baby face collagen injections - designed to make the face appear more plump - from an unlicensed clinic opened by a close friend. But the fillers hardened. “My skin felt like there was cement underneath,” she says. Desperate to undo the damage, Yue Yue turned to clinics she found through social media - well-known names - but the repairs only made things worse. One clinic attempted to extract the filler using syringes. Instead of removing the hardened material, they extracted her own tissue, leaving her skin loose. Another clinic tried lifting the skin near her ears to reach the filler underneath, leaving her with two long scars and a face that looked unnaturally tight. “My entire image collapsed. I lost my shine and it’s affected my work [in human resources for a foreign company in Shanghai] too. ” She found Dr Yang through SoYoung last year and has since undergone three repair surgeries, including for her eyelids which were damaged during a previous operation by another clinic. But while Dr Yang’s surgeries have brought visible improvements, some of the damage from the botched procedures may be permanent. “I don’t want to become prettier any more,” she says. “If I could go back to how I looked before surgery, I’d be quite happy. ” Every year, tens of thousands like Yue Yue fall victim to unlicensed cosmetic clinics in China. But even some licensed clinics and qualified surgeons aren’t following the rules strictly. In 2020, actress Gao Liu’s botched nose operation - in which the tip of her nose turned black and died - went viral. “My face was disfigured and I was very down. It ruined my acting career. ” She had received the nose surgery at a licensed Guangzhou clinic called She’s Times from Dr He Ming, who was described as its “chief surgeon” and a nose surgery expert. But in reality Dr He was not fully qualified to perform the surgery without supervision and had not obtained his licensed plastic surgeon status from the Guangdong Provincial Health Commission. Authorities fined the clinic, which closed soon after the scandal, and barred Dr He from practising for six months. However, weeks before She’s Times was officially dissolved, a new clinic, Qingya, requested to register at the same address. BBC Eye has found strong links between She’s Times and Qingya, such as the same Weibo account and the retention of several staff, including Dr He. The BBC has also learned that Dr He only obtained the licensed plastic surgeon qualification in April 2024, even though he was technically barred from applying for the status for five years from the date he was sanctioned in 2021. Qingya now claims to have opened 30 branches. Dr He, Qingya and Guangdong Provincial Health Commission did not respond to the BBC’s requests for comment. The Chinese Embassy in the UK said: “The Chinese government consistently requires enterprises to operate in strict compliance with national laws, regulations, and relevant policy provisions. ” Four years and two repair operations later, Gao Liu’s nose remains uneven. “I really regret it. Why did I do it?” China’s Central Health Commission has been trying to crack down on the issue of under-qualified health practitioners performing tasks beyond their expertise in recent years - including ordering local health bodies to improve regulation and issuing stricter guidelines - but problems persist. In today’s China, looking good is important for professional success. A quick search on popular job recruitment platforms reveals many examples of employers listing physical requirements for roles, even when they have little to do with the actual work. One receptionist role asks for candidates to be “at least 160cm tall and aesthetically pleasing”, while an administrative job demands “an appealing look and an elegant presence”. And now that pressure is being exploited by a growing scam in some Chinese clinics in which vulnerable young women are offered jobs, but only if they pay for expensive surgeries carried out by their would-be employers. Da Lan, not her real name, applied for a “beauty consultant” job at a clinic in Chengdu, south-western China, on a popular recruitment website in March 2024. After the interview, she was offered the position that same evening. But she says when she began her role the next morning, she was taken to a small room by her manager, who scanned her up and down and gave her an ultimatum - get cosmetic work done or lose out on the job. Da Lan says she was given less than an hour to decide. Under pressure, she agreed to undergo double eyelid surgery - priced at over 13,000 yuan (£1,330) - more than three times the monthly salary of the role - with more than 30% annual interest. She says staff took her phone and used it to apply for a so-called “beauty loan,” falsifying her income details. Within a minute, the loan was approved. By noon, she was undergoing medical tests. An hour later, she was on the operating table. From job offer to debt and surgery - all within 24 hours. You can watch the documentary on BBC Two at 23:00 BST on Wednesday 23 April. Outside of the UK, you can watch the documentary on YouTube. The surgery did nothing for her job prospects. Da Lan says her manager belittled her, shouting her name in public and swearing at her. She quit after just a few weeks. Looking back, she believes the job was never real. “They wanted me to leave from the beginning,” she says. Despite having worked there for more than 10 days, she was paid only 303 yuan ($42). With help from her friends, Da Lan paid off the debt for her surgery after six months. BBC Eye spoke to dozens of victims, and met three including Da Lan in Chengdu, a city that has set out to become China’s “capital of cosmetic surgery”. Some have been trapped in much larger debt for years. The clinic Da Lan says scammed her had previously been reported by other graduates and exposed by local media, but it remains open and is still recruiting for the same role. This scam isn’t limited to clinic jobs - it’s creeping into other industries. Some live-streaming companies pressure young women to take out loans for surgery, promising a shot at influencer fame. But behind the scenes, these firms often have undisclosed agreements with clinics - taking a cut from every applicant they send to the operating table. In a bohemian-style café in Beijing, the perfect setting for a selfie, Abby meets her friends for coffee. The trio adjust their poses and edit their faces in great detail - extending eyelashes and reshaping their cheekbones. When asked what they like most about their facial features, they hesitate, struggling to name a single part they wouldn’t consider altering. The conversation turns to chin implants, upper-lip shortening, and nose surgery. Abby says she’s thinking about another nose job - her current one is six years old - but surgeons are finding it difficult to operate. “My skin isn’t as stretchable after so many procedures. The doctors don’t have much to work with. You can’t give them enough fabric for a vest and expect a wedding dress. ” The metaphor lingers in the air, underscoring the toll taken by all of the operations. But despite everything, Abby has no plans to stop. “I don’t think I’ll ever stop my journey of becoming more beautiful. ” "

Either give up or lose weight fast,’” recalls Abby, who was preparing for her drama exams at the time. Abby’s mother stepped in, taking her to get liposuction to remove fat from her belly and legs. Abby remembers her mother’s words as she waited in the clinic in a hospital gown, nervous about the impending operation. “Just be brave and walk in. You’ll become pretty once you’re out. ” The surgery was traumatic. Abby was only given partial anaesthesia and remained conscious throughout. “I could see how much fat was extracted from my body and how much blood I was losing,” she says. Now 35, Abby has gone on to have more than 100 procedures, costing half a million dollars. She co-owns a beauty clinic in central Beijing and has become one of the most recognisable faces of China’s plastic surgery boom. But the surgeries have come at a physical cost. Sitting in front of a mirror inside her luxury duplex apartment in Beijing, she gently dabs concealer onto bruises from a recent face-slimming injection - a procedure she undergoes monthly to help her face appear “firmer and less chubby” after three jaw reduction surgeries removed too much bone. But she insists she has no regrets about the surgeries and believes her mother made the right decision all those years ago. “The surgery worked. I became more confident and happier, day by day. I think my mum made the right call. ” Once seen as taboo, plastic surgery has exploded in popularity over the last 20 years in China, fuelled by rising disposable incomes and shifts in social attitudes, in large part driven by social media. Every year, 20 million Chinese people pay for cosmetic procedures. Overwhelmingly, it is young women who seek surgery. Eighty per cent of patients are women and the average age of someone receiving surgery is 25. While appearance has always been important in Chinese culture, particularly for women, beauty standards in the country are changing. For years, the most sought-after features were a blend of Western ideals, anime fantasy and K-Pop inspiration: The double eyelid, the sculpted jawline, the prominent nose, and the symmetrical face. But lately, more disturbing procedures are on the rise - chasing an unrealistic, hyper-feminine, almost infantile ideal. Botox is now injected behind the ears to tilt them forward, creating the illusion of a smaller, daintier face. Lower eyelid surgery, inspired by the glassy gaze of anime heroines, widens the eyes for an innocent, childlike look. Upper lip shortening narrows the space between lip and nose, thought to signal youth. But much of this beauty is built for the screen. Under filters and ring lights, the results can look flawless. In real life, the effect is often uncanny - a face not quite human, not quite child. Cosmetic surgery apps like SoYoung (New Oxygen) and GengMei (More Beautiful) - claiming to offer algorithm-driven analysis of “facial imperfections” - have been surging in popularity. After scanning and assessing users’ faces, they provide surgery recommendations from nearby clinics, taking a commission from each operation. These and other beauty trends are shared and promoted by celebrities and influencers on social media, rapidly changing what’s considered desirable and normal. As one of China’s earliest cosmetic surgery influencers, Abby has documented her procedures across major social media platforms and joined SoYoung soon after it launched. Yet despite having undergone more than 100 procedures, when she scans her face using SoYoung’s “magic mirror” feature, the app still points out “imperfections” and suggests a long list of recommended surgeries. “It says I have eye bags. Get a chin augmentation? I’ve done that. ” Abby seems amused. “Nose-slimming? Should I get another nose surgery?” Unlike typical e-commerce sites, beauty apps like SoYoung also offer a social media function. Users share detailed before-and-after diaries and often ask superusers like Abby for their advice. To meet surging demand, clinics are opening up rapidly across China. But there’s a shortage of qualified practitioners and large numbers of clinics are operating without a licence. According to a report by iResearch, a marketing research firm, as of 2019, 80,000 venues in China were providing cosmetic procedures without a licence and 100,000 cosmetic practitioners were working without the right qualifications. As a result, it’s estimated that hundreds of accidents are happening every day inside Chinese cosmetic surgery clinics. Dr Yang Lu, a plastic surgeon and owner of a licensed cosmetic surgery clinic in Shanghai, says in recent years the number of people coming for surgeries to repair botched operations has been growing. “I’ve seen many patients whose first surgery was botched because they went to unlicensed places,” Dr Yang says. “Some even had surgery inside people’s homes. ” Yue Yue, 28, is among those to have had surgery that went badly wrong. In 2020 she received baby face collagen injections - designed to make the face appear more plump - from an unlicensed clinic opened by a close friend. But the fillers hardened. “My skin felt like there was cement underneath,” she says. Desperate to undo the damage, Yue Yue turned to clinics she found through social media - well-known names - but the repairs only made things worse. One clinic attempted to extract the filler using syringes. Instead of removing the hardened material, they extracted her own tissue, leaving her skin loose. Another clinic tried lifting the skin near her ears to reach the filler underneath, leaving her with two long scars and a face that looked unnaturally tight. “My entire image collapsed. I lost my shine and it’s affected my work [in human resources for a foreign company in Shanghai] too. ” She found Dr Yang through SoYoung last year and has since undergone three repair surgeries, including for her eyelids which were damaged during a previous operation by another clinic. But while Dr Yang’s surgeries have brought visible improvements, some of the damage from the botched procedures may be permanent. “I don’t want to become prettier any more,” she says. “If I could go back to how I looked before surgery, I’d be quite happy. ” Every year, tens of thousands like Yue Yue fall victim to unlicensed cosmetic clinics in China. But even some licensed clinics and qualified surgeons aren’t following the rules strictly. In 2020, actress Gao Liu’s botched nose operation - in which the tip of her nose turned black and died - went viral. “My face was disfigured and I was very down. It ruined my acting career. ” She had received the nose surgery at a licensed Guangzhou clinic called She’s Times from Dr He Ming, who was described as its “chief surgeon” and a nose surgery expert. But in reality Dr He was not fully qualified to perform the surgery without supervision and had not obtained his licensed plastic surgeon status from the Guangdong Provincial Health Commission. Authorities fined the clinic, which closed soon after the scandal, and barred Dr He from practising for six months. However, weeks before She’s Times was officially dissolved, a new clinic, Qingya, requested to register at the same address. BBC Eye has found strong links between She’s Times and Qingya, such as the same Weibo account and the retention of several staff, including Dr He. The BBC has also learned that Dr He only obtained the licensed plastic surgeon qualification in April 2024, even though he was technically barred from applying for the status for five years from the date he was sanctioned in 2021. Qingya now claims to have opened 30 branches. Dr He, Qingya and Guangdong Provincial Health Commission did not respond to the BBC’s requests for comment. The Chinese Embassy in the UK said: “The Chinese government consistently requires enterprises to operate in strict compliance with national laws, regulations, and relevant policy provisions. ” Four years and two repair operations later, Gao Liu’s nose remains uneven. “I really regret it. Why did I do it?” China’s Central Health Commission has been trying to crack down on the issue of under-qualified health practitioners performing tasks beyond their expertise in recent years - including ordering local health bodies to improve regulation and issuing stricter guidelines - but problems persist. In today’s China, looking good is important for professional success. A quick search on popular job recruitment platforms reveals many examples of employers listing physical requirements for roles, even when they have little to do with the actual work. One receptionist role asks for candidates to be “at least 160cm tall and aesthetically pleasing”, while an administrative job demands “an appealing look and an elegant presence”. And now that pressure is being exploited by a growing scam in some Chinese clinics in which vulnerable young women are offered jobs, but only if they pay for expensive surgeries carried out by their would-be employers. Da Lan, not her real name, applied for a “beauty consultant” job at a clinic in Chengdu, south-western China, on a popular recruitment website in March 2024. After the interview, she was offered the position that same evening. But she says when she began her role the next morning, she was taken to a small room by her manager, who scanned her up and down and gave her an ultimatum - get cosmetic work done or lose out on the job. Da Lan says she was given less than an hour to decide. Under pressure, she agreed to undergo double eyelid surgery - priced at over 13,000 yuan (£1,330) - more than three times the monthly salary of the role - with more than 30% annual interest. She says staff took her phone and used it to apply for a so-called “beauty loan,” falsifying her income details. Within a minute, the loan was approved. By noon, she was undergoing medical tests. An hour later, she was on the operating table. From job offer to debt and surgery - all within 24 hours. You can watch the documentary on BBC Two at 23:00 BST on Wednesday 23 April. Outside of the UK, you can watch the documentary on YouTube. The surgery did nothing for her job prospects. Da Lan says her manager belittled her, shouting her name in public and swearing at her. She quit after just a few weeks. Looking back, she believes the job was never real. “They wanted me to leave from the beginning,” she says. Despite having worked there for more than 10 days, she was paid only 303 yuan ($42). With help from her friends, Da Lan paid off the debt for her surgery after six months. BBC Eye spoke to dozens of victims, and met three including Da Lan in Chengdu, a city that has set out to become China’s “capital of cosmetic surgery”. Some have been trapped in much larger debt for years. The clinic Da Lan says scammed her had previously been reported by other graduates and exposed by local media, but it remains open and is still recruiting for the same role. This scam isn’t limited to clinic jobs - it’s creeping into other industries. Some live-streaming companies pressure young women to take out loans for surgery, promising a shot at influencer fame. But behind the scenes, these firms often have undisclosed agreements with clinics - taking a cut from every applicant they send to the operating table. In a bohemian-style café in Beijing, the perfect setting for a selfie, Abby meets her friends for coffee. The trio adjust their poses and edit their faces in great detail - extending eyelashes and reshaping their cheekbones. When asked what they like most about their facial features, they hesitate, struggling to name a single part they wouldn’t consider altering. The conversation turns to chin implants, upper-lip shortening, and nose surgery. Abby says she’s thinking about another nose job - her current one is six years old - but surgeons are finding it difficult to operate. “My skin isn’t as stretchable after so many procedures. The doctors don’t have much to work with. You can’t give them enough fabric for a vest and expect a wedding dress. ” The metaphor lingers in the air, underscoring the toll taken by all of the operations. But despite everything, Abby has no plans to stop. “I don’t think I’ll ever stop my journey of becoming more beautiful. ” "

    "title": "Latest: Who was the murderer whose skin binds a book?",
    "body": "2025/04/22 - It has been recently reported that The cover of a book held at a Suffolk museum was recently found to be made from the skin of a man hanged for a notorious murder almost 200 years ago. William Corder was convicted of killing a woman in 1827, which shocked Georgian Britain and became known as the Red Barn Murder. Curators at Moyse’s Hall Museum in Bury St Edmunds realised the book, which was on a bookshelf in an office, had been overlooked but it has now gone on display. It had been donated decades ago by a family with close connections to the surgeon who anatomised Corder’s body. So what do we know of William Corder and the murder, which fascinates to this day? William was from a middle-class family of tenant farmers in the village of Polstead, between Ipswich and Sudbury, at the turn of the 19th Century. At the age of 22, when he and Maria Marten became lovers, he was the head of the Corder family and had a reputation as a ladies’ man. Maria, who was 24 and lived at home with her mole-catcher father, a stepmother, sister, and her young son, may have seen young William as a means of escape. In 1827, William came up with a plan to elope, telling Maria to meet him at the Red Barn on the Corders’ farm, then run off to Ipswich to get the banns for their wedding. Maria was not seen again and William disappeared. William eventually left Suffolk and wrote to the Marten family to say he had eloped with Maria to the Isle of Wight. In reality, he was holed up just outside London and Maria was buried at the lovers’ rendezvous, having been shot in the neck. Almost a year later, legend states, Ann Marten had a dream her stepdaughter was dead and at the Red Barn. Maria’s father dug with his “mole spud” spade and found his daughter’s remains. As a manhunt ensued, a newspaper editor flagged that he knew of a William Corder. “He is effectively on the run, and the theory is he is lonely, and puts an advert in the newspaper asking for a new wife,” says Dan Clarke, a heritage officer at Moyse’s Hall Museum. It holds many Red Barn Murder artefacts, including two books covered in Corder’s skin. The authorities traced Corder, who denied any knowledge of Maria, but had a letter from Polstead telling him her body had been found. Corder was brought to Bury St Edmunds on 10 counts of murder, each based on a different theory about Maria’s demise and to strengthen the chance of a conviction. In his defence he claimed Maria had killed herself, thereby accusing the dead woman of a capital crime. He was found guilty after a two-day trial, and in a final confession said he had accidentally shot Maria during an argument. It is estimated 7,000 to 10,000 people came to see him hanged outside the prison at the stroke of noon on 11 August 1828. Later that day, people queued to file past his body at the town’s Shire Hall. “There were so many people, the story goes they couldn’t get him outside the prison, so they had to hit a hole in the side of the building and create a temporary scaffold,” said Mr Clarke. “There would have been singing and dancing, you would have been able to buy a section of the rope afterwards. ” Polstead became a tourist attraction, the Red Barn and even Maria’s gravestone chipped away by souvenir-hunters. Public intrigue in the Red Barn Murder sparked books, plays and music, and it permeates the true crime culture to this day. At a distance of two centuries, it has become a ripping yarn, the true story clouded in legend. It is probably fuelled, in part, by being able to stand face-to-face with Corder’s image, his eyes shut and his nostrils flared. His death mask is held at Moyse’s Hall and Norwich Castle. For many years, until it eventually began to fall apart, his skeleton was used to teach medical students at West Suffolk Hospital. Disturbingly, two books were covered in his skin and part of the man’s scalp, with ear included, was kept as a gruesome ornament. All are at Moyse’s Hall. Terry Deary, who created Horrible Histories, believes Corder has been “maligned” with Maria incorrectly portrayed as an innocent young maiden. Moyse’s Hall said it would redress the focus on Corder with a future exhibition which will shine a light on woman victims in Suffolk history, including Maria. Heritage assistant Abbie Smith said 80% of its visitors were “desperate” to know about the Red Barn Murder. “How it ended is a big factor, it was such a spectacle and people are going to be drawn to it. “It’s a gory, grotty one, so people seem to like that - rather worryingly. ” The first book of the two books is about the trial. It was written by the journalist Jay Curtis and the title on the spine is “Trial of W Corder”. There is an annotation inside written by the surgeon who performed William Corder’s dissection, George Creed, which states that it was the surgeon himself who tanned the skin and bound the book in the year 1838. The second book is thought to be the same edition, but the spine reads “Polstead – William Corder”. This book was donated to the museum by a family which has close ties to George Creed, who he left a number of his possessions to. Follow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X. "

    "body": "2025/04/22 - Experts revealed that The cover of a book held at a Suffolk museum was recently found to be made from the skin of a man hanged for a notorious murder almost 200 years ago. William Corder was convicted of killing a woman in 1827, which shocked Georgian Britain and became known as the Red Barn Murder. Curators at Moyse’s Hall Museum in Bury St Edmunds realised the book, which was on a bookshelf in an office, had been overlooked but it has now gone on display. It had been donated decades ago by a family with close connections to the surgeon who anatomised Corder’s body. So what do we know of William Corder and the murder, which fascinates to this day? William was from a middle-class family of tenant farmers in the village of Polstead, between Ipswich and Sudbury, at the turn of the 19th Century. At the age of 22, when he and Maria Marten became lovers, he was the head of the Corder family and had a reputation as a ladies’ man. Maria, who was 24 and lived at home with her mole-catcher father, a stepmother, sister, and her young son, may have seen young William as a means of escape. In 1827, William came up with a plan to elope, telling Maria to meet him at the Red Barn on the Corders’ farm, then run off to Ipswich to get the banns for their wedding. Maria was not seen again and William disappeared. William eventually left Suffolk and wrote to the Marten family to say he had eloped with Maria to the Isle of Wight. In reality, he was holed up just outside London and Maria was buried at the lovers’ rendezvous, having been shot in the neck. Almost a year later, legend states, Ann Marten had a dream her stepdaughter was dead and at the Red Barn. Maria’s father dug with his “mole spud” spade and found his daughter’s remains. As a manhunt ensued, a newspaper editor flagged that he knew of a William Corder. “He is effectively on the run, and the theory is he is lonely, and puts an advert in the newspaper asking for a new wife,” says Dan Clarke, a heritage officer at Moyse’s Hall Museum. It holds many Red Barn Murder artefacts, including two books covered in Corder’s skin. The authorities traced Corder, who denied any knowledge of Maria, but had a letter from Polstead telling him her body had been found. Corder was brought to Bury St Edmunds on 10 counts of murder, each based on a different theory about Maria’s demise and to strengthen the chance of a conviction. In his defence he claimed Maria had killed herself, thereby accusing the dead woman of a capital crime. He was found guilty after a two-day trial, and in a final confession said he had accidentally shot Maria during an argument. It is estimated 7,000 to 10,000 people came to see him hanged outside the prison at the stroke of noon on 11 August 1828. Later that day, people queued to file past his body at the town’s Shire Hall. “There were so many people, the story goes they couldn’t get him outside the prison, so they had to hit a hole in the side of the building and create a temporary scaffold,” said Mr Clarke. “There would have been singing and dancing, you would have been able to buy a section of the rope afterwards. ” Polstead became a tourist attraction, the Red Barn and even Maria’s gravestone chipped away by souvenir-hunters. Public intrigue in the Red Barn Murder sparked books, plays and music, and it permeates the true crime culture to this day. At a distance of two centuries, it has become a ripping yarn, the true story clouded in legend. It is probably fuelled, in part, by being able to stand face-to-face with Corder’s image, his eyes shut and his nostrils flared. His death mask is held at Moyse’s Hall and Norwich Castle. For many years, until it eventually began to fall apart, his skeleton was used to teach medical students at West Suffolk Hospital.

    "body": "2025/04/22 - Here’s what you need to know: Marks and Spencer (M&amp;S) says it has been dealing with a “cyber incident” affecting some of its services over the last few days. The UK retailer said its Click and Collect service had been impacted by technical issues along with its ability to collect contactless payments - with many customers taking to social media to complain about delays. M&amp;S chief executive Stuart Machin apologised to customers in a note on Tuesday. He said the company had been forced to temporarily make “small changes” to store operations “to protect you and our business”. “There is no need for you to take any action at this time and if the situation changes, we will let you know,” he said. The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK’s data watchdog, has been notified. “Marks &amp; Spencer plc has made us aware of an incident and we are assessing the information provided,” an ICO spokesperson told the BBC. In a notice to investors, M&amp;S said it had engaged “external cyber security experts to assist with investigating and managing the incident”. “We are taking actions to further protect our network and ensure we can continue to maintain customer service,” it added. The company said it also reported the incident to the National Cyber Security Centre. M&amp;S told customers it was working to resolve some “limited” delays to Click and Collect orders. It comes after some shoppers complained over the weekend about various issues - including being unable to use gift cards or vouchers in stores. One person called the issues a “total failure for customers” in a post on X. “A simple message out to customers to save a journey would have worked a treat,” they said. And another said they were unable to pay for clothes using a gift card while shopping at a M&amp;S store in Liverpool. M&amp;S has confirmed it is still experiencing technical difficulties affecting its ability to process gift cards, alongside Click and Collect orders. Daniel Card of the Chartered Institute for IT (BCS) said the M&amp;S incident was “a reminder of the gap that often exists between our perception of cyber resilience and the reality”. “Even well-resourced organisations aren’t immune, which underlines the importance of action at every level,” he said. He said while this may feel daunting for some smaller organisations, many common vulnerabilities “can be addressed through practical, proportionate steps”. These may include securing devices and email accounts to protect from targeted attempts to compromise a person or business. This is just the latest in a series of IT problems to hit major high street names. Morrisons experienced significant problems with their Christmas orders last year, with deliveries cancelled and discounts not applied on the biggest grocery shopping day of the year. This was followed by two major outages on what was pay day for many in the first two months of this year. And in January, serious IT problems at Barclays affected the bank’s app and online banking. It was later disclosed the firm could face compensation payments of £12. 5m. In February, several banks – notably Lloyds – faced outages, leaving businesses unable to pay staff. Ian McShane, a security expert at cyber security company Arctic Wolf, said the issues experienced by M&amp;S over Easter showed that “cyber attackers never take a day off”. “Criminals are always on the look out to cause the most disruption for the least amount of effort,” he added. “Given the long weekend is the second biggest trading event for food and drink retailers after Christmas, this is exactly what happened here as the majority of the British public enjoyed the long weekend. ” Additional reporting by Graham Fraser "

    "body": "2025/04/22 - Here’s what you need to know: Video game studio Bethesda has announced the long-rumoured launch of a remastered version of its 2006 hit Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. The fourth instalment of the series has maintained a cult following among fans despite it being almost two decades since its original release. Now, gamers have been surprised as a remaster of the classic game has not only been announced - but released to digital stores immediately. It comes as fans await the next game in the series, with the most recent entry - Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - having been released in 2011. More than 600,000 people watched the live announcement on YouTube. And the reveal that the game would be available immediately drew shock and excitement from those watching, with many viewers writing “Praise be Todd” in the comments - in reference to Bethesda director Todd Howard. In 2006, Oblivion launched on PC and the Xbox 360 console as the product of a co-publishing agreement between Bethesda and Take-Two Interactive’s label, 2K Games. “Oblivion was a really defining moment in the series,” Howard said in the announcement. “I think with a remaster, we want people to feel the way they did then - but it’s still a game of its time, you want to keep the bones in place,” he said. Bethesda showed off a series of significant graphics upgrades in its launch video, with updated gameplay, user interface and audio systems. Players will also be able to upgrade their characters in a new way, combining systems both from the original and the sequel. One of the developers called the remaster “a love letter” to the original game. Set in the open world of Tamriel, the game places players in an empire on the verge of downfall - after the mysterious death of Emperor Uriel Septim VII leaves behind a vacant throne and missing heir. Rachel Howie, a content creator and Twitch partner, said the game was “long overdue the currently very trendy remaster treatment”. “It’s such a great opportunity for the generation who grew up thinking Skyrim was peak role-playing game to meet its charming little brother,” she added. Oblivion racked up 9. 5m sales according to gaming website Polygon, and is fondly remembered by fans. Skyrim then released five years later to a massive response, selling more than 40 million copies across generations of consoles - it has been re-released on two generations of consoles since it first came out. The news will now leave fans wondering if they may now soon see some news about Elder Scrolls 6, which was announced in 2018, some seven years after Skyrim’s release. Since then, information on the game has been sparse, and mostly limited to rumours. But gamers have come to expect a long wait from Bethesda, which is facing demand for a new Fallout game as well - which remains under wraps despite the success of a hit Amazon TV show based on the series.

    "body": "2025/04/22 - According to new developments, Films made with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) will be able to win top awards at the Oscars, according to its organisers. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences issued new rules on Monday which said the use of AI and other digital tools would “neither help nor harm the chances of achieving a nomination”. Generative AI - which can create text, images, audio and video in response to simple text prompts - helped to produce some of the films awarded top industry accolades in March. But the Academy said it would still consider human involvement when selecting its winners. The Academy said its new language around eligibility for films made using generative AI tools was recommended by its Science and Technology Council. Under further rule changes announced on Monday, Academy members must now watch all nominated films in each category in order to be able to take part in the final round of voting, which decides upon winners. The use of AI in film became a hot topic after Adrian Brody took home the award for Best Actor for his role in The Brutalist at this year’s Oscars ceremony in March. The movie used generative AI to improve the actor’s accent when he spoke Hungarian. It then emerged similar voice-cloning technology was used to enhance singing voices in the Oscar-winning musical Emilia Perez. The technology’s ability to quickly alter or match the tone and style of an artist, or perform edits such as subtly changing someone’s appearance, has helped it become more popular in the production of music and film. But AI use remains controversial, and artists and actors have voiced concerns over the material used to train such tools and its impact upon their livelihoods. Actors and screenwriters previously highlighted fears about losing work to AI during the 2023 strikes in Hollywood. “If you can take my face, my body and my voice and make me say or do something that I had no choice about, that’s not a good thing,” actress Susan Sarandon told the BBC from a picket line. And screenwriters are concerned studios would seek to cut costs and save time by using tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT for tasks such as researching, treatment and script writing, instead of humans. Safeguards around the use of AI were established as part of the agreements reached between unions and studios that marked the end of the strikes. But while some actors have seemingly embraced the technology, others, such as Scarlett Johansson, have issued warnings about its potential to allow abuse of their image or likeness. Animators told the BBC in 2024 generative AI tools were not yet good enough to be able to replicate the quality of their work - certainly not to an award-winning standard. “It’s like having a bad writer help you,” said Jonathan Kendrick, co-founder and chairman of global streaming service Rokit Flix. “Sure it will get an outline done, but if you need something with emotional weight, an AI isn’t going to get you an Oscar. ” "

Under further rule changes announced on Monday, Academy members must now watch all nominated films in each category in order to be able to take part in the final round of voting, which decides upon winners. The use of AI in film became a hot topic after Adrian Brody took home the award for Best Actor for his role in The Brutalist at this year’s Oscars ceremony in March. The movie used generative AI to improve the actor’s accent when he spoke Hungarian. It then emerged similar voice-cloning technology was used to enhance singing voices in the Oscar-winning musical Emilia Perez. The technology’s ability to quickly alter or match the tone and style of an artist, or perform edits such as subtly changing someone’s appearance, has helped it become more popular in the production of music and film. But AI use remains controversial, and artists and actors have voiced concerns over the material used to train such tools and its impact upon their livelihoods. Actors and screenwriters previously highlighted fears about losing work to AI during the 2023 strikes in Hollywood. “If you can take my face, my body and my voice and make me say or do something that I had no choice about, that’s not a good thing,” actress Susan Sarandon told the BBC from a picket line. And screenwriters are concerned studios would seek to cut costs and save time by using tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT for tasks such as researching, treatment and script writing, instead of humans. Safeguards around the use of AI were established as part of the agreements reached between unions and studios that marked the end of the strikes. But while some actors have seemingly embraced the technology, others, such as Scarlett Johansson, have issued warnings about its potential to allow abuse of their image or likeness. Animators told the BBC in 2024 generative AI tools were not yet good enough to be able to replicate the quality of their work - certainly not to an award-winning standard. “It’s like having a bad writer help you,” said Jonathan Kendrick, co-founder and chairman of global streaming service Rokit Flix. “Sure it will get an outline done, but if you need something with emotional weight, an AI isn’t going to get you an Oscar. ” "

    "title": "Update: US sets tariffs of up to 3,521% on South East Asia solar panels",
    "body": "2025/04/22 - According to new developments, The US Commerce Department has announced plans to impose tariffs of up to 3,521% on imports of solar panels from four South East Asian countries. It comes after an investigation that began a year ago when several major solar equipment producers asked the administration of then-President Joe Biden to protect their US operations. The proposed levies - targeting companies in Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam - are in response to allegations of subsidies from China and the dumping of unfairly cheap products in the US market. A separate US government agency, the International Trade Commission, is due to reach a final decision on the new tariffs in June. The countervailing and anti-dumping duties, as these tariffs are known, vary between companies and the countries their products are made in. Some solar equipment exporters in Cambodia face the highest duties of 3,521% because of what was seen as a lack of cooperation with the Commerce Department investigation. Products made in Malaysia by Chinese manufacturer Jinko Solar faced some of the lowest duties of just over 41%. Another China-based firm, Trina Solar, faces tariffs of 375% for the products it makes in Thailand. Neither company immediately responded to requests for comment from BBC News. In recent years, many Chinese firms have moved operations to South East Asia in a bid to avoid tariffs imposed since the start of US President Donald Trump’s first term. The US Commerce Department’s findings were welcomed by the American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Trade Committee - a group of manufacturers that called on the US government to launch the investigation. “This is a decisive victory for American manufacturing and confirms what we’ve long known: that Chinese-headquartered solar companies have been cheating the system,” said Tim Brightbill, lead counsel to the Alliance. In 2023, America imported almost $12bn (£8. 9bn) in solar equipment from the four countries, according to US Census Bureau figures. While the planned tariffs are likely to help US solar panel manufacturers, they could also mean extra costs for businesses and consumers who have benefited from the availability of cheaper solar products. The levies would be imposed on top of other tariffs already rolled out by the Trump administration. The planned tariffs were announced just days after Chinese President Xi Jinping completed a tour of Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia. The trip was aimed to boost ties with the region and encourage those nations to resist what he called “unilateral bullying” by the US. Trump has so far imposed taxes of up to 145% on imports from China. Other countries are now facing a blanket US tariff of 10% until July. His administration said last week that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%. China has hit back with a 125% tax on products from the US and vowed to “fight to the end”. "

    "title": "Update: Five ways for first-time buyers to get on the housing ladder",
    "body": "2025/04/21 - Let’s dive into the details: Mortgage rates are expected to come down over the next year, which could make owning a home a possibility for millions more people. Thinking about where to start can be a daunting prospect, but there are an increasing number of ways to save up for a deposit, and get a foothold in the housing market. We spoke to some leading mortgage experts to get their tips for anyone starting out on the journey to owning their own home. The average deposit paid for a first-time buyer is £34,500, according to UK Finance. So the sooner you start saving, the better. A Lifetime ISA (individual savings account) offers 25% bonuses for those who are saving for a first home. For each £4,000 saved in any given tax year, the government will top it up with an extra £1,000. Digital mortgage broker Tembo specialises in helping first-time buyers, and has seen a rise in savers starting young. “If you maxed out your savings allowance from the age of 18 to 30, you could pick up £22,000 in free bonuses,” says Tembo chief executive Richard Dana. “Family members can contribute too. But beware that the money can only be withdrawn to fund a first-time home purchase up to the value of £450,000. ” Those struggling to raise a deposit have now got a broad range of 95% loan-to-value (LTV) deals available, says David Hollingworth from mortgage brokers London &amp; Country. In fact, more low-deposit mortgages are available to choose from than at any time since the financial crisis of 2008, according to new figures. “Yorkshire Building Society offers a £5,000 deposit mortgage which does what it says on the tin and could offer a mortgage equivalent to as much as 99% of the purchase price,” says Mr Hollingsworth. “Skipton’s Track Record mortgage can offer as much as 100% lending for those that can demonstrate a track record of paying rent that exceeds the mortgage payment. ” However, small deposit mortgages typically offer higher rates, and may not be suitable for many self-employed homebuyers who may struggle to meet the strict eligibility criteria. Shared ownership has been available in England since the 1980s and enables a first-time buyer to own a “share” in their home of between 25% and 75% of the value. There are similar schemes available in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. You need a small deposit and can take out a mortgage to buy your share and then pay rent to the landlord for the rest. Over time you can increase the amount of the property you own and reduce rental payments. It’s known as “staircasing” and the aim is to eventually own your home outright. “Although shared ownership is usually seen as an option for younger, first-time buyers, that is not always the case,” says Laura Gaskell, sales manager at shared ownership specialists Snugg Homes. “The average age of a buyer with us is now 48 and we have people who have been homeowners previously. Our advice is to register your interest and regularly check the eligibility criteria. ” The “Bank of Mum and Dad” might not be an option for some, but there are ways to get help from family members without borrowing any money at all. An “income boost” mortgage (otherwise known as a Joint Borrower Sole Proprietor mortgage) allows a homebuyer to add up to three family members (or in some cases friends) to their mortgage to increase the amount they can borrow from a lender. While the “boosters” are on the mortgage, they are not owners of the home and therefore the buyer’s first-time buyer status is not affected. “This is increasingly popular amongst younger first-time buyers who are earlier in their careers and are earning less,” says Richard Dana from Tembo. “It’s the primary option for families who want to support their children, but might not have the cash available to gift as a deposit, or want to keep hold of cash savings for their retirement or a rainy day. ” As buyers will be borrowing more than they would qualify for on their own, they should make sure they can afford the repayments. The risk for the “boosters” is that they are jointly liable for the mortgage in the event the buyer is unable to make repayments. Many lenders offer “professional” mortgages which could enable a buyer working in a regulated or accredited profession - such as doctors, architects and accountants - to borrow up to six times their income. Specialist lenders also offer deals to particular professions. For instance, Teachers Building Society works with those in the teaching profession, while Kensington offers a better earnings calculation to NHS staff, police officers, firefighters and teachers. “Given that these career profiles are often more secure, Kensington felt it could be more generous in its approach as long as the mortgage will be affordable,” says David Hollingworth. “It can also take account of overtime and income from a second job to help improve the borrowing amount. ” But he adds: “It’s always still important to shop around. Rates on these mortgages can be a little higher, so taking advice on the best overall fit is important. ” "

    "title": "Latest: 'Why I want an IVF baby to screen out gene that made me go blind'",
    "body": "2025/04/20 - It has been recently reported that Blind content creator and TikTok star Lucy Edwards says she’s “so excited” to be on a health kick to undergo IVF, but reveals the dilemma she faced in deciding to screen out the very gene that made her blind. “I’m so broody,” the 29-year-old tells the BBC Access All podcast. Lucy and her husband Ollie married at Kew Gardens two years ago and are now ready to start a family - but there are complications to consider. Lucy has the rare genetic condition Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP) and lost her sight due to this aged 17, just months after meeting Ollie. The condition runs through the female line - Lucy’s mum has IP although isn’t blind, her Grandma did too and her great-aunt was blind in one eye. Lucy is totally blind, but, if she had been a boy, she may not have survived. The abnormal IP gene is located on the X chromosome. Women have two X chromosomes, while males have X and Y, meaning the appearance of the gene can be more catastrophic in male pregnancies. “My grandma actually had nine miscarriages,” Lucy says. This is one of the facts that played into the complicated decision Lucy and Ollie made to opt for pre-implantation genetic testing, a special type of IVF where embryos are created outside of the body and screened for the genetic condition. Only those embryos which are not affected by the condition are placed back into the womb. Without medical intervention, Lucy says there would be four potential outcomes to any pregnancy she carried: A healthy and unaffected boy or girl, an affected boy she would likely miscarry or who would be born with severe brain damage or an affected girl. She pauses, then laughs: “That sounds horrible, doesn’t it? That’s me. ” And that’s the quandary. IVF will edit out the very thing that has made Lucy who she is today - a journalist, advocate, author and broadcaster. It is an emotive topic of debate. The most well-known conversation is around Down’s syndrome and the number of women who choose to abort a pregnancy once their baby is tested and diagnosed as having the condition. The question is around the value people place on other peoples’ lives which may not look like our own. In 2021 campaigner Heidi Crowter, who herself has Down’s syndrome, challenged legislation allowing foetuses with the condition to be aborted up until birth. She took her case to the High Court arguing the rules were discriminatory to disabled people who could live a good life. She lost the case and the subsequent argument she made at the Court of Appeal. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) later rejected it as well, but Heidi continues to campaign to have the law overturned. It is something Lucy is very aware of and she and her husband have spent a long time considering. “It’s understanding that it is removing that part of me that makes me, me,” Lucy says. “It’s such a personal decision and I know that I’m opening myself up for possible designer baby discussions, but I know I’m doing it for the right reasons. ” Lucy says first being diagnosed with IP and then losing her sight as a teenager were both traumatic events and she wants to minimise the likelihood of miscarriage to limit any future traumatic load. She says she found it impossible to “knowingly” consider having a baby naturally once she knew the science was available to give a baby the healthiest start possible. “If I had a baby and, unknowingly, I had a gorgeous, gorgeous baby with disabilities, I would be so thankful, so happy and amazed but knowingly having this gene? That’s why we’re having IVF. ” IP doesn’t just cause blindness, it can also cause severe epilepsy and more difficult outcomes. Lucy says having the option to ensure complications were not passed on felt like both a responsibility and a privilege previous generations did not have. “Whether we like it or not, we have to be responsible here. Maybe a responsible issue for you, if you have IP or another genetic disorder, is to have a child naturally and we are not judging you in any shape or form, this is just our decision. ” In response to their openness around this decision comments were overwhelmingly positive from Lucy’s fans which she thinks might be because she is so “disability positive” in her everyday life - “I love being blind,” she frequently states. But Lucy says responses have been different around the world. When she was working in Japan and her content was reaching audiences unfamiliar with her story, she faced a lot more trolling. “I got a lot of abusive comments that go into my spam filter questioning why I would be a mother,” she says. “I know that I’m going to get a lot of abuse, but I’m just going to block them. “I’m going to be OK. All I think about is the other mothers that have come before me who are competent, capable and resilient. ” Lucy, who is known for her How Does A Blind Girl… series of videos, is overjoyed by the prospect of IVF but she has also been frank about the fact she currently does not qualify, owing to her current weight, a sensitive element of IVF treatment that many keep to themselves. NHS guidelines specify your Body Mass Index (BMI) must be 30 or under to qualify - a healthy BMI is considered to be between 18. 5 and 24. 9. “I need to be a BMI of 30 and I’m very open that I need to lose 9kg,” Lucy says. “I’ve already lost 15kg. ” Her health journey has involved swimming, lifting weights and many runs with Ollie tethered to her as her sighted guide. She has also found a love for batch cooking nutritious meals which she posts about on all of her channels on Instagram, TikTok and YouTube and the workarounds she has developed as a blind cook. “I wanted a positive representation of losing weight online because it’s all about this blinking jab,” she says, referring to weight loss injections. “I just wanted to lose it healthily, have lots of nice food, talk about meal prep and just smile and run. ” Once she hits the required BMI, Lucy will qualify for three rounds of IVF on the NHS. She will contact her consultant, after which she has to “spit in a cup” and offer up her DNA for genetic testing and analysis. Over a period of about three months, a genetics team will “make a bespoke test to find the gene within my eggs,” Lucy explains. Meanwhile Lucy will inject herself with trigger shots to stimulate the follicles within her ovaries to increase the number of eggs produced which will be retrieved, and then made into embryos with Ollie’s sperm. The embryos will then be tested so only ones without the IP gene will be possible candidates. Those embryos will be “shuffled about” so Lucy and Ollie don’t know which will be selected in terms of gender or other genetic qualities, and implanted into Lucy, who will carry the baby to term. Lucy can’t wait for the moment she holds her baby in her arms. “It will never stop being a thing within my mind that this gene is being eradicated,” she admits. “But I am very happy in my decision. ” A few days ago Lucy posted on Instagram, her cardigan tightened at the back with a hairband to make it smaller and fit. “I’ve lost so much [weight] that my clothes are too loose now so we had to tie it up with a bobble,” she tells her followers. “Fingers crossed [we’re] only a few weeks away from ringing the clinic. ” You can listen to Lucy Edwards on BBC Access All on BBC Sounds.

    "title": "Breaking: 'Why I want an IVF baby to screen out gene that made me go blind'",
    "body": "2025/04/20 - It has been recently reported that Blind content creator and TikTok star Lucy Edwards says she’s “so excited” to be on a health kick to undergo IVF, but reveals the dilemma she faced in deciding to screen out the very gene that made her blind. “I’m so broody,” the 29-year-old tells the BBC Access All podcast. Lucy and her husband Ollie married at Kew Gardens two years ago and are now ready to start a family - but there are complications to consider. Lucy has the rare genetic condition Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP) and lost her sight due to this aged 17, just months after meeting Ollie. The condition runs through the female line - Lucy’s mum has IP although isn’t blind, her Grandma did too and her great-aunt was blind in one eye. Lucy is totally blind, but, if she had been a boy, she may not have survived. The abnormal IP gene is located on the X chromosome. Women have two X chromosomes, while males have X and Y, meaning the appearance of the gene can be more catastrophic in male pregnancies. “My grandma actually had nine miscarriages,” Lucy says. This is one of the facts that played into the complicated decision Lucy and Ollie made to opt for pre-implantation genetic testing, a special type of IVF where embryos are created outside of the body and screened for the genetic condition. Only those embryos which are not affected by the condition are placed back into the womb. Without medical intervention, Lucy says there would be four potential outcomes to any pregnancy she carried: A healthy and unaffected boy or girl, an affected boy she would likely miscarry or who would be born with severe brain damage or an affected girl. She pauses, then laughs: “That sounds horrible, doesn’t it? That’s me. ” And that’s the quandary. IVF will edit out the very thing that has made Lucy who she is today - a journalist, advocate, author and broadcaster. It is an emotive topic of debate. The most well-known conversation is around Down’s syndrome and the number of women who choose to abort a pregnancy once their baby is tested and diagnosed as having the condition. The question is around the value people place on other peoples’ lives which may not look like our own. In 2021 campaigner Heidi Crowter, who herself has Down’s syndrome, challenged legislation allowing foetuses with the condition to be aborted up until birth. She took her case to the High Court arguing the rules were discriminatory to disabled people who could live a good life. She lost the case and the subsequent argument she made at the Court of Appeal. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) later rejected it as well, but Heidi continues to campaign to have the law overturned. It is something Lucy is very aware of and she and her husband have spent a long time considering. “It’s understanding that it is removing that part of me that makes me, me,” Lucy says. “It’s such a personal decision and I know that I’m opening myself up for possible designer baby discussions, but I know I’m doing it for the right reasons. ” Lucy says first being diagnosed with IP and then losing her sight as a teenager were both traumatic events and she wants to minimise the likelihood of miscarriage to limit any future traumatic load.

    "body": "2025/04/19 - Experts revealed that “Are they going to think I’m going to steal stuff from here?” That’s the question Chantelle remembers asking herself after starting a new job and wondering whether or not to share her Romany heritage. Chantelle, 23 from Bedfordshire, says she’s proud of her background but has sometimes been “nervous” to share it because of negative portrayals of her community in the media. “When you watch films, it’s always like, ‘Oh, these are the Gypsies, they’re the bad guys,’” she explains. Chantelle features in Stacey Dooley’s BBC documentary Growing Up Gypsy, which follows three young Romany women as they navigate everyday life. The show comes as the charity Friends, Families and Travellers (FFT) - an organisation working to end discrimination against the Gypsy, Roma and Traveller (GRT) community - says it regularly hears from Romany Gypsy women who feel pressure to hide their identity in professional or public spaces to avoid discrimination and hate. Ebony, 23 from Nottinghamshire, works as a beautician and recalls a client at a previous job, who didn’t know about her heritage, telling her she didn’t want to park in a certain area because there were Gypsies living near there. “And I was sat there, painting her nails, like: ‘Little do you know’,” she recalls thinking. Romany Gypsies are one of the three ethnic groups within the GRT community. Some in the community prefer to refer to themselves as travellers, while others prefer to use the term Gypsy. Presenter Dooley says she felt privileged to be invited into the community but that being with the women and their families has shown her “how unwelcome they can sometimes be made to feel”. It’s something that as a Romany Gypsy myself, I’ve had conflicting feelings about. Now 26, I’m incredibly proud of my heritage - it’s often one of the first things I’ll share about myself and I have incredible memories of summers spent in the cherry orchard where my family worked. However, I didn’t always feel that way. At school, I was reluctant to tell people about my identity for fear of being called a derogatory name and when I applied for university, my parents told me not to tick the GRT ethnicity box on the entrance form in case it hurt my chances of getting in. I filled it in anyway, and have grown more confident in talking about my heritage but the hesitation is still there and is shared by many in the community today. “There is a lot of hate and discrimination against travellers, and people don’t get jobs because they’re travellers,” says Ebony, on why she’s hidden her heritage in the past. A spokesperson for the FFT says prejudice against the GRT community “remains widespread” and “too often goes unchallenged”. And in 2021, a YouGov poll organised by the FFT suggested that 22% of people surveyed would be uncomfortable employing a Gypsy or traveller. However, Ebony also says she’s had positive interactions with her employers when she did share her heritage and loves where she currently works. Chantelle now enjoys working as a content creator, with more than 400,000 followers on TikTok, and is more open in speaking about her culture, explaining people online were really “interested” to learn more about her heritage. Her content includes answering followers’ questions about her community and making traditional dishes, like bacon pudding, which she learned to make from her grandmother. However, she still sees negative comments, with some even claiming those who live in a house are not Gypsies, which Chantelle says shows a misunderstanding of how her culture works. “It goes back in your generations and it’s in your blood,” she says. Despite the comments, Chantelle continues to make videos and appreciates her heritage, explaining: “I know we get talked bad about and things like that, but I’m proud of it. ” Ebony, meanwhile, hopes that people watching the documentary learn more about the GRT community and aren’t so prejudiced towards them. “I don’t look at every non-traveller like you’re a bad person,” she says, adding that the community does experience that type of prejudice. “That’s what I would like people to sort of open their eyes to,” she adds.

    "body": "2025/04/19 - Experts revealed that “Be mindful about what you’re sharing, because once it’s online, it’s online forever,” says Lilly Sabri. The fitness influencer, who has six million followers on YouTube, has urged fans to heed her words as she plans to return to Instagram after a long absence. Two years ago she was living her dream, running two successful businesses helped by her explosion in popularity during the Covid lockdowns. But the physiotherapist went silent on Instagram in 2023 when a popular gossip podcast shared a story about a man who had allegedly cheated on his well-known fiancée - with enough clues to suggest the man in question was her then partner. She woke to find “thousands” of notifications from social media and messaging apps as seemingly the whole world wanted to know whether there was truth behind the rumours. Lilly was watching the life she knew fall apart in real time. The creators of the podcast, which the BBC has chosen not to name, say they are not responsible for actions taken as a result of their content. Lilly - who has not discussed what happened in public until now - sat down with me to talk about the moment which changed her future. Soon after the podcast launched, her social media feeds began to fill with what she called “investigator-style” videos speculating about her life and how she would react. Her first step was to delete her Instagram app. “I just had to get away from social media,” she said. “People wanted answers, people wanted to see even more into my life, even when I asked for privacy. “All I could do was control my own reaction and that meant withdrawing and protecting myself and my family. ” Lilly’s relationship ended, but there was much to untangle - her ex was also her business partner, leaving her faced with raising the funds to buy him out. He has been contacted by the BBC for comment. She left Dubai, where she had been living with her partner, to move back in with her family in the UK - and had to lay off most of the companies’ staff. “It was very humbling and very difficult,” Lilly said, explaining she had to go back to doing the work she used to have staff for - such as editing, filming her videos, and running the business’ social media feeds. It meant even though she was trying her best to avoid it, Lilly was constantly engaging with social media platforms to keep her businesses going - and she had to try to avoid looking at myriad personal comments. “I was trying to manage the heartbreak and the shock combined with keeping the business afloat,” she said. Her most recent Instagram post until now, on her personal account, was uploaded in November 2023 - with many of the comments asking why she has not posted for so long. Up until the gossip podcast launched, Lilly had been open about her life online. And she accepted there may have “potentially” been less interest in her relationship had she shared less on social media. “I truly don’t know the answer to that,” she said. “I think when I compare to some other people, I didn’t show a lot of my lifestyle. “But it was clearly enough for people to put two and two together. ” Lilly acknowledged she had shared snapshots about herself to help build her brand - to draw in those who wanted to know more about her - and for a long time it was a successful strategy. While she maintained some boundaries such as not revealing information about her family, she said there was always an unspoken pressure to share more. “I’ve learned people will constantly want more the more you give,” she said. “If it’s just showing your dog, or sharing your relationship, it’s like ‘okay, what else, now show the house’. “It can lead to a lot of exposure because you’re chasing likes or you feel that’s what your customers want. ” Nearly eighteen months after her most recent post, Lilly is in a different headspace. Her business - the workout videos and a nutrition app - are thriving and she feels ready to return to her personal Instagram account - but with a very different set of rules this time around. “I’m not going to be showing my personal relationships, I’ve been too scarred, and I can’t do it again,” she said.

    "body": "2025/04/19 - Let’s dive into the details: “Be mindful about what you’re sharing, because once it’s online, it’s online forever,” says Lilly Sabri. The fitness influencer, who has six million followers on YouTube, has urged fans to heed her words as she plans to return to Instagram after a long absence. Two years ago she was living her dream, running two successful businesses helped by her explosion in popularity during the Covid lockdowns. But the physiotherapist went silent on Instagram in 2023 when a popular gossip podcast shared a story about a man who had allegedly cheated on his well-known fiancée - with enough clues to suggest the man in question was her then partner. She woke to find “thousands” of notifications from social media and messaging apps as seemingly the whole world wanted to know whether there was truth behind the rumours.

    "title": "Latest: The Supreme Court ruling gives clarity - but now comes the difficult part",
    "body": "2025/04/19 - Let’s dive into the details: “A victory for common sense” or “devastating” –  the contrasting reactions to the statement by five Supreme Court judges that legally the term “woman” means a biological woman. Behind the different responses lie many of the often bitter and vitriolic arguments that set the country on a long, tricky road towards Wednesday’s unambiguous judgement. When the highest court in the land ruled that sex is binary - meaning legally it should be interpreted as referring to either a biological man or a biological woman - it was providing clarity that had been missing from such conversations for years. Words like “woman” and “sex” had become loaded with different meanings depending on your viewpoint. Language that for centuries had been uncomplicated and accepted, became a battleground. The judgement is intended to draw a line under that. It argues that for the Equality Act to be consistent, the term woman has to mean a biological woman. That does not include biological males, even if they have certificates to say they have changed gender. This means that where there are, for instance, women-only spaces, then a biological man who identifies as a woman cannot use them. That includes changing rooms, toilets, women’s refuges, single-sex hospital wards and anywhere designated as for one sex only. How much change that will mean in practice will be set out in detailed guidance. Until then, there remain lots of questions and some confusion - and that is challenging in an area where views are so polarised. It was Baroness Falkner, the woman who heads the watchdog that regulates equality laws, who described the judgement as a victory for common sense. She added it was only such a victory if you recognised trans people, “that they exist, they have rights, and their rights must be respected”. She also told the BBC about the abuse she had faced since taking over as chair of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) in 2020. She had previously told the Times that women had the right to question gender identity, and that had led to some very personal abuse from those who disagreed with her. “I had not realised how difficult the job would be,” she said. “It has taken a toll, but if you are in public life you have to take that. ” The second response to the judgement was from the trans rights campaign group TransActual, which described the Supreme Court judgement as devastating. One of its activists, Jane Fae, told the BBC the judgement felt like a physical body blow, and that it was as if trans people were being excluded from society. “Today we’re feeling very alone” she said. “What does this mean - can I use this loo, can I do that, can I do the other?” In contrast, the women’s groups who fought the case feel vindicated and jubilant. Helen Joyce, the director of advocacy at the campaign group Sex Matters, says the ruling is “incredibly important for the half of humanity who need single-sex spaces”. Women’s groups argue that the ruling is important for reasons of privacy, safety, dignity and discrimination. The Supreme Court case was brought by a group called For Women Scotland. It wanted to overturn Scottish legislation which said 50% of members on public boards should be women - and trans women were included in their definition. The group lost its case in Scotland’s highest court but appealed to the UK Supreme Court. The case was heard towards the end of last year. “What we wanted was clarity in the law - when something is described as a single-sex service, a single-sex space, that this relates to biology,” Susan Smith from For Women Scotland told the BBC. Over time the arguments over how a woman is defined had become increasingly angry, bitter and divided, because the stakes were high for all involved. For transgender people, who say they often face victimisation and harassment, the battles were rooted in attempts to win better legal protection. “Legal gender recognition is essential for trans people to enjoy the full spectrum of rights each of us is entitled to, including safety, health and family life,” according to Sacha Deshmukh, the chief executive of Amnesty International UK.  The charity opposed For Women Scotland’s case in the Supreme Court. The question of how to achieve legal recognition rose to prominence in 2002 when two judgements at the European Court of Human Rights found the UK was breaching human rights by failing to legally recognise transgender people in their acquired gender. This eventually led to the 2004 Gender Recognition Act, which allowed a trans person to apply for a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC).  This recognised their preferred gender rather than their biological sex, allowing official documents like birth certificates to be changed to reflect that. But it was a long-winded process requiring two doctors to sign it off and for the person to “live in their acquired gender” for at least two years. Only about 8,000 people have applied for a GRC since they came into being, according to government figures. Campaigners began calling for the process to be simplified. In a response to a 2020 government consultation on amending the GRA, Stonewall, the LGBTQ+ rights organisation, called for a “move to a de-medicalised and straightforward legal gender recognition process”. Gradually these calls gained momentum. In 2022, the Scottish government introduced a law that would allow people to “self-identify” in their desired gender. This was later blocked by the UK government and eventually dropped as a Scottish policy. As the rights of trans people were being debated, women’s groups started pushing back about what that meant for biological women. The meaning of words like “woman” and “sex” took on new significance, if someone who was biologically male had a certificate that identified them as a woman for legal purposes. Under the 2010 Equality Act, sex was a protected characteristic, and so was gender reassignment. With the very meaning of those categories in dispute, legal experts said it set the protections of one group against the protections of another. The complexities mean courts and tribunals have frequently been called on to arbitrate. And social media has often provided a starting point for angry disputes, connecting and amplifying voices, and in many cases, leading to more entrenched viewpoints.  It had become a culture war. In 2019, tax expert Maya Forstater lost her job because she tweeted that she did not believe people could change their sex. She said biological sex was immutable and not the same as gender identity.   As a result, her work contract was not renewed. Her employer said it wanted to build an inclusive workplace. She lost her case at an employment tribunal case, but an Appeal Court judge later ruled that gender critical beliefs were protected by the Equalities Act. In 2023, she was awarded £100,000 compensation for unfair dismissal. It was a high-profile battle through tribunals and courts which put employers’ policies on inclusion under the spotlight and raised questions about whether by protecting the rights of one group, another was being discriminated against. Ms Forstater went on to set up the campaign group Sex Matters, and was among those celebrating outside the Supreme Court on Wednesday. There have been other similar cases brought against employers since then. Sex Matters lists 11 settled or ongoing cases on its website. But other high-profile cases have also shaped the broader debate. In March 2020, 23-year-old Keira Bell took legal action against the only children’s NHS gender clinic, saying she should have been challenged more by medical staff over her decision to transition to a male whilst a teenager. Although she eventually lost her case, it started a chain reaction, which led to a shake-up of gender services for children and young people. And in 2021 the Sussex University professor, Kathleen Stock, quit her job after being accused of having transphobic views. She had published a book that questioned whether gender identity was more significant than biological sex. She denied being transphobic but was subjected to a student campaign to remove her from her post.  The university was later fined for failing to uphold freedom of speech. These and other cases put an uncomfortable spotlight on a debate that many preferred to ignore or dismiss as mainly happening on social media, because it was too tricky and using the wrong language could lead to abuse. Yet fundamental questions were being raised about freedom of speech, how we treat each other and how you define a woman. The need for clarity had become overwhelming. In terms of equality law, the Supreme Court ruling provided that. For women’s groups there is sheer relief that biological facts will now drive decisions. But for many trans people there is distress. Even though they still have protections under the Equality Act, for many it does not feel like that.  They worry that harassment will increase. Activist Charlie Craggs, who is a trans woman, told the BBC it was really sad that this tiny community of less than 1% of the population was being “thrown under the bus”. Crucially, the ruling provides a clear framework for what equality laws mean. The EHRC says it is “working at pace” to update its guidance, and expects that to be ready by the summer. It has already made it clear that if a single-sex space, like a toilet or changing room, is women-only, that means biological males who identify as women should not use it. It says instead that trans people should use their “powers of advocacy” to campaign for third spaces, such as unisex toilets. And it has said it will pursue the NHS if it does not follow the latest ruling. Health service guidance on single-sex wards currently says that “trans people should be accommodated according to their presentation, the way they dress, and the name and pronouns they currently use”. Currently this allows trans women to be offered beds on women-only wards. The NHS says its policy is under review. Former Supreme Court judge Lord Sumption says that while the ruling means organisations can exclude trans women from women only facilities, they are not necessarily obliged to do so. He told Radio 4’s PM programme that in sport, for example, it would be down to individual governing bodies to decide who is allowed to compete in women’s sport. “They could decide to allow trans women to compete on the same basis as biological women, some sporting authorities do, although I think that in light of the latest judgement, they would be wise to say so expressly in their rules,” he said. British Transport Police has been the first body to actually change its policies. It says strip searches of people in custody will be carried out by officers of the same biological sex It means a trans woman would be searched by a male officer, and a police officer who is a trans woman would not be able to search a biological woman. The domestic violence charity Refuge says the ruling will not change the way it operates. Its chief executive, Gemma Sherrington, says, “we remain firmly committed to supporting all survivors of domestic abuse, including trans women”. But for many businesses, sports clubs and other organisations it is too soon to know what this will mean in practice. They will need to see the detailed guidance from the Equality Commission first. Until then it is difficult to know how much change, if any, they will need to make or what new issues might arise. Some organisations will also have to decide whether they have the space and money to provide so-called third spaces or unisex facilities For trans people there is also a lot of uncertainty. They will have been used to using spaces which correspond to their gender identity - changing that may be difficult and, for some, frightening. The Equality Commission expects to publish its new statutory code of conduct by the summer. Only then will these questions begin to be answered.

The case was heard towards the end of last year. “What we wanted was clarity in the law - when something is described as a single-sex service, a single-sex space, that this relates to biology,” Susan Smith from For Women Scotland told the BBC. Over time the arguments over how a woman is defined had become increasingly angry, bitter and divided, because the stakes were high for all involved. For transgender people, who say they often face victimisation and harassment, the battles were rooted in attempts to win better legal protection. “Legal gender recognition is essential for trans people to enjoy the full spectrum of rights each of us is entitled to, including safety, health and family life,” according to Sacha Deshmukh, the chief executive of Amnesty International UK.  The charity opposed For Women Scotland’s case in the Supreme Court. The question of how to achieve legal recognition rose to prominence in 2002 when two judgements at the European Court of Human Rights found the UK was breaching human rights by failing to legally recognise transgender people in their acquired gender. This eventually led to the 2004 Gender Recognition Act, which allowed a trans person to apply for a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC).  This recognised their preferred gender rather than their biological sex, allowing official documents like birth certificates to be changed to reflect that. But it was a long-winded process requiring two doctors to sign it off and for the person to “live in their acquired gender” for at least two years. Only about 8,000 people have applied for a GRC since they came into being, according to government figures. Campaigners began calling for the process to be simplified. In a response to a 2020 government consultation on amending the GRA, Stonewall, the LGBTQ+ rights organisation, called for a “move to a de-medicalised and straightforward legal gender recognition process”. Gradually these calls gained momentum. In 2022, the Scottish government introduced a law that would allow people to “self-identify” in their desired gender. This was later blocked by the UK government and eventually dropped as a Scottish policy. As the rights of trans people were being debated, women’s groups started pushing back about what that meant for biological women. The meaning of words like “woman” and “sex” took on new significance, if someone who was biologically male had a certificate that identified them as a woman for legal purposes. Under the 2010 Equality Act, sex was a protected characteristic, and so was gender reassignment. With the very meaning of those categories in dispute, legal experts said it set the protections of one group against the protections of another. The complexities mean courts and tribunals have frequently been called on to arbitrate. And social media has often provided a starting point for angry disputes, connecting and amplifying voices, and in many cases, leading to more entrenched viewpoints.  It had become a culture war. In 2019, tax expert Maya Forstater lost her job because she tweeted that she did not believe people could change their sex. She said biological sex was immutable and not the same as gender identity.   As a result, her work contract was not renewed. Her employer said it wanted to build an inclusive workplace. She lost her case at an employment tribunal case, but an Appeal Court judge later ruled that gender critical beliefs were protected by the Equalities Act. In 2023, she was awarded £100,000 compensation for unfair dismissal. It was a high-profile battle through tribunals and courts which put employers’ policies on inclusion under the spotlight and raised questions about whether by protecting the rights of one group, another was being discriminated against. Ms Forstater went on to set up the campaign group Sex Matters, and was among those celebrating outside the Supreme Court on Wednesday. There have been other similar cases brought against employers since then. Sex Matters lists 11 settled or ongoing cases on its website. But other high-profile cases have also shaped the broader debate. In March 2020, 23-year-old Keira Bell took legal action against the only children’s NHS gender clinic, saying she should have been challenged more by medical staff over her decision to transition to a male whilst a teenager. Although she eventually lost her case, it started a chain reaction, which led to a shake-up of gender services for children and young people. And in 2021 the Sussex University professor, Kathleen Stock, quit her job after being accused of having transphobic views. She had published a book that questioned whether gender identity was more significant than biological sex. She denied being transphobic but was subjected to a student campaign to remove her from her post.  The university was later fined for failing to uphold freedom of speech. These and other cases put an uncomfortable spotlight on a debate that many preferred to ignore or dismiss as mainly happening on social media, because it was too tricky and using the wrong language could lead to abuse. Yet fundamental questions were being raised about freedom of speech, how we treat each other and how you define a woman. The need for clarity had become overwhelming. In terms of equality law, the Supreme Court ruling provided that. For women’s groups there is sheer relief that biological facts will now drive decisions. But for many trans people there is distress. Even though they still have protections under the Equality Act, for many it does not feel like that.  They worry that harassment will increase. Activist Charlie Craggs, who is a trans woman, told the BBC it was really sad that this tiny community of less than 1% of the population was being “thrown under the bus”. Crucially, the ruling provides a clear framework for what equality laws mean. The EHRC says it is “working at pace” to update its guidance, and expects that to be ready by the summer. It has already made it clear that if a single-sex space, like a toilet or changing room, is women-only, that means biological males who identify as women should not use it. It says instead that trans people should use their “powers of advocacy” to campaign for third spaces, such as unisex toilets. And it has said it will pursue the NHS if it does not follow the latest ruling. Health service guidance on single-sex wards currently says that “trans people should be accommodated according to their presentation, the way they dress, and the name and pronouns they currently use”. Currently this allows trans women to be offered beds on women-only wards. The NHS says its policy is under review. Former Supreme Court judge Lord Sumption says that while the ruling means organisations can exclude trans women from women only facilities, they are not necessarily obliged to do so. He told Radio 4’s PM programme that in sport, for example, it would be down to individual governing bodies to decide who is allowed to compete in women’s sport. “They could decide to allow trans women to compete on the same basis as biological women, some sporting authorities do, although I think that in light of the latest judgement, they would be wise to say so expressly in their rules,” he said. British Transport Police has been the first body to actually change its policies. It says strip searches of people in custody will be carried out by officers of the same biological sex It means a trans woman would be searched by a male officer, and a police officer who is a trans woman would not be able to search a biological woman. The domestic violence charity Refuge says the ruling will not change the way it operates. Its chief executive, Gemma Sherrington, says, “we remain firmly committed to supporting all survivors of domestic abuse, including trans women”. But for many businesses, sports clubs and other organisations it is too soon to know what this will mean in practice. They will need to see the detailed guidance from the Equality Commission first. Until then it is difficult to know how much change, if any, they will need to make or what new issues might arise. Some organisations will also have to decide whether they have the space and money to provide so-called third spaces or unisex facilities For trans people there is also a lot of uncertainty. They will have been used to using spaces which correspond to their gender identity - changing that may be difficult and, for some, frightening. The Equality Commission expects to publish its new statutory code of conduct by the summer. Only then will these questions begin to be answered.

    "body": "2025/04/19 - Experts revealed that Artists and creatives are pushing back against a recent trend using artificial intelligence (AI) to generate “starter pack” images of people as toys - which they say may be in danger of risking their livelihoods. Since the start of April, thousands of people have uploaded their photos to generate images of themselves as dolls, despite warnings of damaging the environment, giving away personal information, and devaluing creativity. Nick Lavallee, who has made custom action figures for six years, told the BBC he was concerned his work may be at risk after “AI images saturated social media”. “People are sick of them,” he said. “It’s an artistic aesthetic - AI-generated art diminishes that. ” Nick has made figures of - and for - comedians, film directors, and artists such as Weezer and Tyler Childers, which sell for as much as $250 (£188) online on his Wicked Joyful website. His success has led to a clothing brand and will soon be followed by a physical shop in his hometown of Manchester, New Hampshire. But he’s concerned action figure commissions could soon dry up, as well as the public perception of his work, from thousands of AI images mimicking his passion. The feeling has been shared by other creatives with the rise of the #StarterPackNoAI movement, which has been used thousands of times since first appearing on Instagram in early April before spreading to X soon after. After Patouret’s post, others quickly joined the counter-trend, with artist Maria Picassó Piquer saying she chose to take part “for fun, but also as a statement”. “While AI pieces all looked more or less the same, I was amazed at the variety of the ‘human’ works,” she said. “Plus, self-portraits added an extra layer of, well, humanity. ” Maria, like many other artists, sees the dual risk of AI images threatening intellectual property rights by being “fed on ‘stolen’ art”, and the possibility of reducing her finding new clients. Illustrator Dav le Dessineux, working in Bordeaux, France, said some in his industry had already lost contracts to AI design work. He contributed his starter pack because “like many artists who use their real hands”, he was “tired” of the deluge of AI-generated doll images. Dav’s illustration featured only a pencil and sheet of white paper - tools he said are “all you need to start being an artist”. “People usually forget about it because of the technology surrounding us, but we really don’t need more than basic stuff to create something and be original,” he said. Eli Dibitonto, an artist living in Barletta, Italy, agreed, describing the process of digitally illustrating his own starter pack as “carefree and fun”. “It doesn’t have to be perfect - mine isn’t,” he said. “Art isn’t meant to be perfect or look flawless. ” And illustrator and student Evie Joyce said creating her own artwork meant being able to consider what to reflect of her personality during a process lasting several hours, rather than seconds. “I think that what’s so magical about it is you’re seeing people put time and effort and their personality, all of their experiences, into pieces of art,” she said. “With AI, it can even steal from artists and steal their work and their style, it just loses that touch of personality. ” Back in New Hampshire, Nick understands the rebellion from illustrators, but says he believes there is use for AI. “I don’t necessarily want to say AI is bad when I know that it could be a useful tool,” he said. “I think all of us have experimented with it. ” And Henk van Ess, a global expert in using AI in investigative research, has proven how useful it can be - but it would be safe to say he does not believe it lies in starter packs. “It’s like watching a supercomputer calculate how many Hobnobs fit in a Sports Direct mug, while solving climate change sits on the ‘to-do’ list,” he said. “Technically impressive? Sure. But it’s the technological equivalent of using the Large Hadron Collider to heat up your Pot Noodle. “While everyone’s busy generating these digital equivalents of small talk, they’re missing the actually revolutionary stuff AI can do - it’s just wasteful to put all that energy into creating digital fluff when we can use it for solving real-world problems. ” And Nick remains positive. “The musicians who get my stuff, who are excited to hold a Wicked Joyful in their hands, they know it’s my artwork, they know it’s mine,” he said. Likewise, Dav is confident in the worth of human work. Despite the rise of pre-fabricated furniture, he says, “people still call on cabinetmakers”. “I hope I’ll be one of those artisans,” he said. Nick, who says he found his purpose “in bringing joy to people” with his creations, said he similarly wanted to remain hopeful about the future. “I really hope people are totally sick of AI action figures,” he said. “But I hope that they are smart enough to understand the difference in something that I’m doing versus what is computer-generated. ” "

    "title": "New: Designed in US, made in China - Why Apple is stuck",
    "body": "2025/04/18 - Let’s dive into the details: Every iPhone comes with a label which tells you it was designed in California. While the sleek rectangle that runs many of our lives is indeed designed in the United States, it is likely to have come to life thousands of miles away in China: the country hit hardest by US President Donald Trump’s tariffs, now rising to 245% on some Chinese imports. Apple sells more than 220 million iPhones a year and by most estimates, nine in 10 are made in China. From the glossy screens to the battery packs, it’s here that many of the components in an Apple product are made, sourced and assembled into iPhones, iPads or Macbooks. Most are shipped to the US, Apple’s largest market. Luckily for the firm, Trump suddenly exempted smartphones, computers and some other electronic devices from his tariffs last week. But the comfort is short-lived. The president has since suggested that more tariffs are coming: “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook’,” he wrote on Truth Social, as his administration investigated “semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN”. The global supply chain that Apple has touted as a strength is now a vulnerability. The US and China, the world’s two biggest economies, are interdependent and Trump’s staggering tariffs have upended that relationship overnight, leading to an inevitable question: who is the more dependent of the two? China has hugely benefited from hosting assembly lines for one of the world’s most valuable companies. It was a calling card to the West for quality manufacturing and has helped spur local innovation. Apple entered China in the 1990s to sell computers through third-party suppliers. Around 1997, when it was on the verge of bankruptcy as it struggled to compete with rivals, Apple found a lifeline in China. A young Chinese economy was opening up to foreign companies to boost manufacturing and create more jobs. It wasn’t until 2001 though that Apple officially arrived in China, through a Shanghai-based trading company, and started making products in the country. It partnered with Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronic manufacturer operating in China, to make iPods, then iMacs and subsequently iPhones. As Beijing began trading with the world - encouraged by the US no less - Apple grew its footprint in what was becoming the world’s factory. Back then, China was not primed to make the iPhone. But Apple chose its own crop of suppliers and helped them grow into “manufacturing superstars,” according to supply chain expert Lin Xueping. He cites the example of Beijing Jingdiao, now a leading manufacturer of high-speed precision machinery, which is used to make advanced components efficiently. The company, which used to cut acrylic, was not considered a machine tool-maker - but it eventually developed machinery to cut glass and became “the star of Apple’s mobile phone surface processing,” Mr Lin says. Apple opened its first store in the country in Beijing in 2008, the year the city hosted the Olympics and China’s relationship with the West was at an all-time high. This soon snowballed to 50 stores, with customers queuing out of the door. As Apple’s profit margins grew, so did its assembly lines in China, with Foxconn operating the world’s largest iPhone factory in Zhengzhou, which has since been termed “iPhone City”. For a fast-growing China, Apple became a symbol of advanced Western tech - simple yet original and slick. Today, most of Apple’s prized iPhones are manufactured by Foxconn. The advanced chips that power them are made in Taiwan, by the world’s largest chip manufacturer, TSMC. The manufacturing also requires rare earth elements which are used in audio applications and cameras. Some 150 of Apple’s top 187 suppliers in 2024 had factories in China, according to an analysis by Nikkei Asia. “There’s no supply chain in the world that’s more critical to us than China,” Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook said in an interview last year. In Trump’s first term, Apple secured exemptions on the tariffs he imposed on China. But this time, the Trump administration has made an example of Apple before it reversed tariffs on some electronics. It believes the threat of steep taxes will encourage businesses to make products in America instead. “The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones - that kind of thing is going to come to America,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview earlier this month. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated that last week: “President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones and laptops. ” She added: “At the direction of the president, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible. ” But many are sceptical of that. The thought that Apple could move its assembly operation to the US is “pure fantasy,” according to Eli Friedman, who formerly sat on the firm’s academic advisory board. He says the company has been talking about diversifying its supply chain away from China since 2013, when he joined the board - but the US was never an option. Mr Friedman adds that Apple didn’t make much progress over the next decade but “really made an effort” after the pandemic, when China’s tightly controlled Covid lockdowns hurt manufacturing output. “The most important new locations for assembly have been Vietnam and India. But of course the majority of Apple assembly still takes place [in China]. ” Apple did not respond to the BBC’s questions but its website says its supply chain spans “thousands of businesses and more than 50 countries”. Any change to Apple’s current supply chain status quo would be a huge blow for China, which is trying to kickstart growth post-pandemic. Many of the reasons that the country wanted to be a manufacturing hub for Western companies in the early 2000s ring true today - it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs, and gives the country a crucial edge in global trade. “Apple sits at the intersection of US-China tensions, and tariffs highlight the cost of that exposure,” says Jigar Dixit, a supply chain and operations consultant. It might explain why China has not bowed to Trump’s threats, retaliating instead with 125% levies on US imports. China has also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets it has in stores, dealing a blow to the US. There is no doubt the US tariffs still being levied on other Chinese sectors will hurt, though. And it’s not just Beijing facing higher tariffs - Trump has made it clear he will target countries that are part of the Chinese supply chain. For instance Vietnam, where Apple has moved AirPods production, was facing 46% tariffs before Trump hit pause for 90 days, so moving production elsewhere in Asia is not an easy way out. “All conceivable places for the huge Foxconn assembly sites with tens or hundreds of thousands of workers are in Asia, and all of these countries are facing higher tariffs,” Mr Friedman says. So what does Apple do now? The company is fighting off stiff competition from Chinese firms as the government pushes for advanced tech manufacturing in a race with the US. Now that “Apple has cultivated China’s electronic manufacturing capabilities, Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo and others can reuse Apple’s mature supply chain,” according to Mr Lin. Last year, Apple lost its place as China’s biggest smartphone seller to Huawei and Vivo. Chinese people are not spending enough because of a sluggish economy and with ChatGPT banned in China, Apple is also struggling to retain an edge among buyers seeking AI-powered phones. It even offered rare discounts on iPhones in January to boost sales. And while operating under President Xi Jinping’s increasingly close grip, Apple has had to limit the use of Bluetooth and Airdrop on its devices as the Chinese Communist Party sought to censor political messages that people were sharing. It weathered a crackdown on the tech industry that even touched Alibaba founder and multi-billionaire Jack Ma. Apple has announced a $500bn (£378bn) investment in the US, though that may not be enough to appease the Trump administration for long. Given the several U-turns and the uncertainty around Trump’s tariffs, more surprise levies are expected - which could again leave the company with little manoeuvring room and even less time. Mr Dixit says smartphone tariffs will not cripple Apple should they rear their head again, but regardless will add “pressure - both operationally and politically” to a supply chain that cannot be unwound quickly. “Clearly the severity of the immediate crisis has been lessened,” Mr Friedman adds, referring to last week’s exemption for smartphones. “But I really don’t think this means Apple can relax. ” Additional reporting by Fan Wang "

Last year, Apple lost its place as China’s biggest smartphone seller to Huawei and Vivo. Chinese people are not spending enough because of a sluggish economy and with ChatGPT banned in China, Apple is also struggling to retain an edge among buyers seeking AI-powered phones. It even offered rare discounts on iPhones in January to boost sales. And while operating under President Xi Jinping’s increasingly close grip, Apple has had to limit the use of Bluetooth and Airdrop on its devices as the Chinese Communist Party sought to censor political messages that people were sharing. It weathered a crackdown on the tech industry that even touched Alibaba founder and multi-billionaire Jack Ma. Apple has announced a $500bn (£378bn) investment in the US, though that may not be enough to appease the Trump administration for long. Given the several U-turns and the uncertainty around Trump’s tariffs, more surprise levies are expected - which could again leave the company with little manoeuvring room and even less time. Mr Dixit says smartphone tariffs will not cripple Apple should they rear their head again, but regardless will add “pressure - both operationally and politically” to a supply chain that cannot be unwound quickly. “Clearly the severity of the immediate crisis has been lessened,” Mr Friedman adds, referring to last week’s exemption for smartphones. “But I really don’t think this means Apple can relax. ” Additional reporting by Fan Wang "

    "title": "Breaking: Designed in US, made in China - Why Apple is stuck",
    "body": "2025/04/18 - Let’s dive into the details: Every iPhone comes with a label which tells you it was designed in California. While the sleek rectangle that runs many of our lives is indeed designed in the United States, it is likely to have come to life thousands of miles away in China: the country hit hardest by US President Donald Trump’s tariffs, now rising to 245% on some Chinese imports. Apple sells more than 220 million iPhones a year and by most estimates, nine in 10 are made in China. From the glossy screens to the battery packs, it’s here that many of the components in an Apple product are made, sourced and assembled into iPhones, iPads or Macbooks. Most are shipped to the US, Apple’s largest market. Luckily for the firm, Trump suddenly exempted smartphones, computers and some other electronic devices from his tariffs last week. But the comfort is short-lived. The president has since suggested that more tariffs are coming: “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook’,” he wrote on Truth Social, as his administration investigated “semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN”. The global supply chain that Apple has touted as a strength is now a vulnerability. The US and China, the world’s two biggest economies, are interdependent and Trump’s staggering tariffs have upended that relationship overnight, leading to an inevitable question: who is the more dependent of the two? China has hugely benefited from hosting assembly lines for one of the world’s most valuable companies. It was a calling card to the West for quality manufacturing and has helped spur local innovation. Apple entered China in the 1990s to sell computers through third-party suppliers. Around 1997, when it was on the verge of bankruptcy as it struggled to compete with rivals, Apple found a lifeline in China. A young Chinese economy was opening up to foreign companies to boost manufacturing and create more jobs. It wasn’t until 2001 though that Apple officially arrived in China, through a Shanghai-based trading company, and started making products in the country. It partnered with Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronic manufacturer operating in China, to make iPods, then iMacs and subsequently iPhones. As Beijing began trading with the world - encouraged by the US no less - Apple grew its footprint in what was becoming the world’s factory. Back then, China was not primed to make the iPhone. But Apple chose its own crop of suppliers and helped them grow into “manufacturing superstars,” according to supply chain expert Lin Xueping. He cites the example of Beijing Jingdiao, now a leading manufacturer of high-speed precision machinery, which is used to make advanced components efficiently. The company, which used to cut acrylic, was not considered a machine tool-maker - but it eventually developed machinery to cut glass and became “the star of Apple’s mobile phone surface processing,” Mr Lin says. Apple opened its first store in the country in Beijing in 2008, the year the city hosted the Olympics and China’s relationship with the West was at an all-time high. This soon snowballed to 50 stores, with customers queuing out of the door. As Apple’s profit margins grew, so did its assembly lines in China, with Foxconn operating the world’s largest iPhone factory in Zhengzhou, which has since been termed “iPhone City”. For a fast-growing China, Apple became a symbol of advanced Western tech - simple yet original and slick. Today, most of Apple’s prized iPhones are manufactured by Foxconn. The advanced chips that power them are made in Taiwan, by the world’s largest chip manufacturer, TSMC. The manufacturing also requires rare earth elements which are used in audio applications and cameras. Some 150 of Apple’s top 187 suppliers in 2024 had factories in China, according to an analysis by Nikkei Asia. “There’s no supply chain in the world that’s more critical to us than China,” Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook said in an interview last year. In Trump’s first term, Apple secured exemptions on the tariffs he imposed on China. But this time, the Trump administration has made an example of Apple before it reversed tariffs on some electronics. It believes the threat of steep taxes will encourage businesses to make products in America instead. “The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones - that kind of thing is going to come to America,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview earlier this month. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated that last week: “President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones and laptops. ” She added: “At the direction of the president, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible. ” But many are sceptical of that. The thought that Apple could move its assembly operation to the US is “pure fantasy,” according to Eli Friedman, who formerly sat on the firm’s academic advisory board. He says the company has been talking about diversifying its supply chain away from China since 2013, when he joined the board - but the US was never an option. Mr Friedman adds that Apple didn’t make much progress over the next decade but “really made an effort” after the pandemic, when China’s tightly controlled Covid lockdowns hurt manufacturing output. “The most important new locations for assembly have been Vietnam and India. But of course the majority of Apple assembly still takes place [in China]. ” Apple did not respond to the BBC’s questions but its website says its supply chain spans “thousands of businesses and more than 50 countries”. Any change to Apple’s current supply chain status quo would be a huge blow for China, which is trying to kickstart growth post-pandemic. Many of the reasons that the country wanted to be a manufacturing hub for Western companies in the early 2000s ring true today - it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs, and gives the country a crucial edge in global trade. “Apple sits at the intersection of US-China tensions, and tariffs highlight the cost of that exposure,” says Jigar Dixit, a supply chain and operations consultant. It might explain why China has not bowed to Trump’s threats, retaliating instead with 125% levies on US imports. China has also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets it has in stores, dealing a blow to the US. There is no doubt the US tariffs still being levied on other Chinese sectors will hurt, though. And it’s not just Beijing facing higher tariffs - Trump has made it clear he will target countries that are part of the Chinese supply chain. For instance Vietnam, where Apple has moved AirPods production, was facing 46% tariffs before Trump hit pause for 90 days, so moving production elsewhere in Asia is not an easy way out. “All conceivable places for the huge Foxconn assembly sites with tens or hundreds of thousands of workers are in Asia, and all of these countries are facing higher tariffs,” Mr Friedman says. So what does Apple do now? The company is fighting off stiff competition from Chinese firms as the government pushes for advanced tech manufacturing in a race with the US. Now that “Apple has cultivated China’s electronic manufacturing capabilities, Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo and others can reuse Apple’s mature supply chain,” according to Mr Lin.

    "title": "Latest: Nvidia - The AI chip giant caught between US and China",
    "body": "2025/04/18 - Let’s dive into the details: Computer chip giant Nvidia has once again found itself at the centre of US-China tensions over trade and technology. On Thursday Nvidia’s chief executive Jensen Huang flew to Beijing to meet senior Chinese officials, just after the US imposed new export controls on its chips. The California-based company will require licenses to export its H20 AI chip to China, a move which the US Commerce Department said was designed to safeguard “national and economic security”. Nvidia said federal officials had told them the requirement will be in force for the “indefinite future”. But why is the company so pivotal in the race for AI supremacy between the US and China? Nvidia designs advanced chips, or semiconductors, that are used in generative artificial intelligence. Generative AI can produce new content from a user’s prompt, like ChatGPT. In recent years, a surge in global demand for AI chips led Nvidia to become one of the world’s most valuable companies. In November, Nvidia briefly unseated Apple as the largest company in the world by market capitalisation. Because its chips are seen as so essential to advancements in generative AI, successive US administrations have scrutinised Nvidia’s relationship with China. Washington hopes the new export controls will slow China’s development of advanced AI chips - especially their use by the Chinese military - and secure an advantage in AI competition with Beijing. US restrictions on Nvidia selling chips to China are not new. In 2022, Joe Biden’s administration imposed separate export controls on the sale of advanced semiconductors to China. Nvidia specifically designed the H20 chip to comply with those existing restrictions. A more powerful Nvidia chip, the H100, was already banned for sale in China. However, the recent emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese generative AI company, has prompted fresh concerns in the US that even less powerful chips could lead to significant technological breakthroughs. DeepSeek claimed it could operate as effectively as other applications like ChatGPT using less advanced chips. Now, there is increasing demand for Nvidia’s H20 chips among Chinese technology companies such as Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok. Those companies have outstanding orders for the chips. But because there is no grace period on the imposition of the new curbs, Nvidia expects to be hit by losses of $5. 5bn (£4. 15bn) from these orders that it can no longer fulfil. Chim Lee, a senior analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit in Beijing, told the BBC that there are alternative AI chips being developed in China, by companies like Huawei. Although they are currently viewed as inferior to Nvidia’s, Mr Lee said the US curbs could prompt China to focus on developing better chips. “It will introduce challenges to China’s AI scene, but it won’t massively slow down China’s AI development and deployment,” Mr Lee added. China is a critical market for Nvidia. The world’s second-largest economy accounted for 13% of its total sales last year, though that is still far less than the United States, which accounted for nearly half. The timing of Mr Huang’s trip is being seen as an effort to shore up Nvidia’s business in China despite the latest curbs. In his Beijing meeting with Ren Hongbin, head of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, Mr Huang said he hoped “to continue to cooperate with China”, according to state broadcaster CCTV. On Thursday, the Financial Times reported that Mr Huang’s trip to China also included a meeting with DeepSeek’s founder, Liang Wenfeng. Separately, top Chinese official He Lifeng told Mr Huang that “China’s market investment and consumption potential is huge”, according to state news agency Xinhua. During talks with Shanghai’s mayor on Friday, Mr Huang said he was committed to the Chinese market, according to a Shanghai government statement. The controls are part of Washington’s broader goal to de-risk supply chains for advanced technology away from China, and bring more semiconductor production back to the US. Nvidia this week announced plans to build up AI servers in the US worth up to $500bn. US president Donald Trump later claimed his re-election drove Nvidia’s decision. And in March, Taiwanese semiconductor giant TSMC, which manufactures Nvidia’s chips, announced it would invest an additional $100bn in advanced manufacturing facilities in Arizona. Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis, told the BBC the latest developments show that global technology is becoming increasingly polarised between “two systems”, one dominated by the US and the other by China. “Tech will be less global in that sense, and it will be subject to more restrictions. ” "

    "title": "Update: Google has illegal advertising monopoly, judge rules",
    "body": "2025/04/17 - Experts revealed that A US judge has ruled tech giant Google has a monopoly in online advertising technology. The US Department of Justice, along with 17 US states, sued Google, arguing the tech giant was illegally dominating the technology which determines which adverts should be placed online and where. This is the second antitrust case Google has lost in a year, after it was ruled the company also had a monopoly on online search. Google said it would appeal against the decision. “Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable and effective,” the firm’s head of regulatory affairs Lee-Ann Mulholland said. US district judge Leonie Brinkema said in the ruling Google had “wilfully engaged in a series of anticompetitive acts” which enabled it to “acquire and maintain monopoly power” in the market. “This exclusionary conduct substantially harmed Google’s publisher customers, the competitive process, and, ultimately, consumers of information on the open web,” she said. Google lost on two counts, while a third was dismissed. “We won half of this case and we will appeal the other half,” Ms Mulholland said. “The court found that our advertiser tools and our acquisitions, such as DoubleClick, don’t harm competition. ” The ruling is a significant win for US antitrust enforcers, according to Laura Phillips-Sawyer, a professor at the University of Georgia School of Law. “It signals that not only are agencies willing to prosecute but also that judges are willing to enforce the law against big tech firms,” she said. She said the verdict sets an important legal precedent and is likely to affect decision-making in corporate America. Google’s lawyers had argued the case focused too much on its past activities, and prosecutors ignored other large ad tech providers such as Amazon. “Google has repeatedly used its market power to self-preference its own products, stifling innovation and depriving premium publishers worldwide of critical revenue needed to sustain high-quality journalism and entertainment,” said Jason Kint, head of Digital Content Next, a trade association representing online publishers. Google owns large companies on the buyer and seller sides of the online advertising market, as well as an ad exchange which matches demand and supply. Internet users will not notice a difference online as a result of the decision, said Anupam Chander, professor of law and technology at Georgetown University. But it affects “the division of monies between advertisers, publishers, and ad service providers”. “The judge seems willing to order structural changes in Google’s ad exchange practices, which may affect Google’s bottom line somewhat, but don’t seem to necessarily threaten its core value proposition as an advertising middleman,” he added. In an ongoing series of antitrust lawsuits, the US government argues Google and its parent company Alphabet should be broken up - which could include selling off parts of the company such as the Chrome browser. The US case will now move to a second “remedies” phase, which could also lead to Alphabet being broken up, said John Kwoka, a professor of economics at Northeastern University. In September, the UK’s competition watchdog provisionally found Google was using anti-competitive practices to dominate the market for online advertising technology. "

    "body": "2025/04/17 - According to new developments, Discord is testing face scanning to verify some users’ ages in the UK and Australia. The social platform, which says it has over 200 million monthly users around the world, was initially used by gamers but now has communities on a wide range of topics including pornography. The UK’s online safety laws mean platforms with adult content will need to have “robust” age verification in place by July. And social media expert Matt Navarra told the BBC “this isn’t a one-off - it’s the start of a bigger shift”. “Regulators want real proof, and facial recognition might be the fastest route there,” he said. But campaigners have said these types of checks are ineffective and could lead to privacy issues. “Age assurance is becoming the new seatbelt for the internet,” said Mr Navarra. “Will it become the norm in the UK? Honestly, yes, probably. ” He said he believed the incoming changes in online safety laws mean online platforms would beef up their age verification processes. “The era of ‘click here to confirm you’re 13’ is dead,” he said. “Get age verification wrong now, and you don’t just lose users - you could lose a courtroom battle or incur fines. ” Firms which do not comply with the Online Safety Act could be fined up to 10% of their global turnover. Instagram previously brought in age checks using facial analysis in 2022 for users who want to change their profile settings to be over 18. The social media company requires users to take a selfie video on their phone and uses AI to estimate the person’s age. Like Discord, they can alternatively upload a picture of their photo ID. The US-based platform says the verification - which it describes as “an experiment” - will be a one-time check. It will apply the first time a user comes across content which it has flagged as sensitive, or if they change their settings on viewing sensitive media. Users can either use the face scanner or upload a photo of their ID to confirm their age. It says information used for age checks will not be stored by Discord or the verification company. Face scans will stay on the device and not be collected, and ID uploads will be deleted after the verification is complete, according to the company. Content which is flagged as sensitive is already automatically blocked or blurred for teenagers. Privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch says age check technology “shouldn’t be seen as a silver bullet solution”. Senior advocacy officer Madeleine Stone says they can pose a risk to users, “including security breaches, privacy intrusion, errors, digital exclusion and censorship”. While industry group the Age Verification Providers Association says there is a “wide range of convenient, privacy-preserving methods”. Their executive director Iain Corby told the BBC the latest technology can estimate age “within one to two years based on a selfie or how you move your hands”. But he also said platforms have a choice on how to use age verification. “They can remove the harmful content altogether, apply age checks to access the whole site, or just check ages before allowing access to high-risk pages and posts,” he said. Australia is planning to bring in a social media ban for all under-16s this year. Recent research found more than 80% of Australian children aged eight to 12 use social media or messaging services that are only meant to be for over-13s New Jersey attorney general Matthew J. Platkin said on Thursday that his office was suing Discord, alleging the company had misled parents about its safety controls and the risks faced by children on the app. Discord was approached for comment.

    "title": "Update: Plan for GPs to keep millions out of hospital",
    "body": "2025/04/17 - Let’s dive into the details: A scheme to help GPs provide care and advice to patients without them joining long NHS hospital waiting lists is being expanded in England, the government has said. GPs will work more closely with specialists to access expert advice quickly for patients with conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, menopause symptoms and ear infections. Backed by £80m of funding, its ambition is to help two million people receive faster and more convenient care in their local community by the end of 2025/26. Health Minister Karin Smyth said the scheme would “save time and stop masses of people having to head to hospital for unnecessary appointments”. The expanded scheme is part of the government’s plan to cut long NHS waiting lists and create extra appointments for patients. It has pledged that 92% of NHS patients will be waiting less than 18 weeks for treatment after referral to a consultant, by the end of this parliament. Between July and December 2024, the scheme diverted 660,000 treatments from hospitals and into the community, the government says. Called ‘Advice and Guidance’, the scheme links GPs and hospital specialists before patients are referred onto waiting lists, so that tests and treatments can be offered in the most convenient place. For example, patients with tinnitus and needing ear wax removal often end up being referred to specialists when they could be helped outside hospitals. And women needing advice on types of HRT could be treated in local hubs, rather than waiting to see a gynaecologist. GP practices are able to claim £20 for each ‘episode of care’, which could include several interactions with specialists. Smyth said the government was “rewiring the NHS” and doing things differently. “This scheme is a perfect example of how we are saving patients time and reducing pressure on key NHS services in the process,” she said. “It will take time to reverse the damaging neglect the NHS has suffered in recent years, but our Plan for Change is starting to deliver benefits for patients, with waiting lists cut by 219,000 since July, and 1,500 new GPs in post. ” National Voices, which represents health charities in England, said “real choice” must be offered to patients about what the best treatment routes are. “We must see strong communication about what the service is and what it means in practical terms for patient care,” director of policy Sharon Brennan said. The British Medical Association said in a statement: “We have seen decades of underinvestment in general practice, and this is an important small step in acknowledging the important role of the GP and supporting practices to deliver enhanced care to patients in the community. “The journey to bringing back the family doctor has only just begun. Now we must focus on the secretary of state’s promise to complete negotiation of a new GP contract within the term of this Parliament in order to safeguard family GP services for the future, and we look forward to working closely with the government to achieve that. ” Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.

    "title": "Update: Tesla whistleblower wins latest legal battle in fight against Musk",
    "body": "2025/04/17 - According to new developments, A Tesla whistleblower who has fought Elon Musk and his company through the courts for years has won the latest round of a long-running legal battle. Engineer Cristina Balan lost her job after she raised a safety concern in 2014 about a design flaw which could affect the cars’ braking. Her defamation claim against the firm seemed to have run out of road when a judge confirmed an arbitration decision dismissing her case - but a panel of appeal judges in California has reversed this decision in her favour. She told BBC News she now wants to face Elon Musk and Tesla in open court. Tesla has not responded to a request for comment. Ms Balan said she believes the case will now in effect go back to square one, and new proceedings can be launched. “We are hoping we will start a new lawsuit and we will have the chance to take on Elon Musk in front of a jury and judge,” she said. The engineer was once so prominent at Tesla that her initials were engraved on the batteries inside Model S vehicles. In an interview with BBC News last year, she said she is determined to prove her innocence for the sake of her son. She also revealed she was in remission from stage-3B breast cancer, and her biggest worry was she may not live to see her final day in court. Ms Balan claimed she was worried the carpets were curling underneath some pedals in Tesla models, creating a safety hazard. She said managers rebuffed her concerns, became hostile, and she lost her job. She then won a wrongful dismissal case - but this turned out to be the start of a long journey through the courts. Ms Balan was publicly accused by Tesla of using its resources for a “secret project” - accusations which amount to embezzlement, a crime under US law. She has consistently denied the accusation, and decided to bring a defamation case against the firm in 2019. “I want to clear my name,” she told BBC News last year. “I wish Elon Musk had the decency to apologise. ” A court then decided Ms Balan’s case should be subject to arbitration per a contract she signed while working for Tesla. The arbitrator found in favour of the firm and Musk, dismissing her claims, due to California’s statute of limitations - meaning too much time had passed since the alleged defamatory statements were made. Tesla brought the case back to a district court in California to have the decision confirmed. However, Ms Balan appealed this decision, and judges from the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found in her favour - in effect deciding the California court did not have the jurisdiction to make its judgement. They have ordered for the confirmation of the arbitration award to be cancelled, and for the district court to dismiss the action due to its lack of jurisdiction. The majority of legal experts the BBC has spoken to believe the case has some way to go before there will be any conclusion. “Tesla is among the many corporations that force employees and customers into opaque arbitration processes and deploy aggressive strategies to retaliate against employees who voice criticism of corporate practices,” said Stanford professor Anat Admati. And Bill Moran, Ms Balan’s attorney, agreed the legal process is far from over. But he said the case was “revived” by the latest ruling. “We are confident we can secure her either a new arbitration or alternatively a trial in court so that her case can be heard on the merits after so many years,” he said. “She has fought cancer while waging this case… she is the epitome of strength and resolve, and she is now one step closer to getting the justice she deserves. ” Additional reporting by Lily Jamali "

And Bill Moran, Ms Balan’s attorney, agreed the legal process is far from over. But he said the case was “revived” by the latest ruling. “We are confident we can secure her either a new arbitration or alternatively a trial in court so that her case can be heard on the merits after so many years,” he said. “She has fought cancer while waging this case… she is the epitome of strength and resolve, and she is now one step closer to getting the justice she deserves. ” Additional reporting by Lily Jamali "

    "title": "Big News: Tesla whistleblower wins latest legal battle in fight against Musk",
    "body": "2025/04/17 - Experts revealed that A Tesla whistleblower who has fought Elon Musk and his company through the courts for years has won the latest round of a long-running legal battle. Engineer Cristina Balan lost her job after she raised a safety concern in 2014 about a design flaw which could affect the cars’ braking. Her defamation claim against the firm seemed to have run out of road when a judge confirmed an arbitration decision dismissing her case - but a panel of appeal judges in California has reversed this decision in her favour. She told BBC News she now wants to face Elon Musk and Tesla in open court. Tesla has not responded to a request for comment. Ms Balan said she believes the case will now in effect go back to square one, and new proceedings can be launched. “We are hoping we will start a new lawsuit and we will have the chance to take on Elon Musk in front of a jury and judge,” she said. The engineer was once so prominent at Tesla that her initials were engraved on the batteries inside Model S vehicles. In an interview with BBC News last year, she said she is determined to prove her innocence for the sake of her son. She also revealed she was in remission from stage-3B breast cancer, and her biggest worry was she may not live to see her final day in court. Ms Balan claimed she was worried the carpets were curling underneath some pedals in Tesla models, creating a safety hazard. She said managers rebuffed her concerns, became hostile, and she lost her job. She then won a wrongful dismissal case - but this turned out to be the start of a long journey through the courts. Ms Balan was publicly accused by Tesla of using its resources for a “secret project” - accusations which amount to embezzlement, a crime under US law. She has consistently denied the accusation, and decided to bring a defamation case against the firm in 2019. “I want to clear my name,” she told BBC News last year. “I wish Elon Musk had the decency to apologise. ” A court then decided Ms Balan’s case should be subject to arbitration per a contract she signed while working for Tesla. The arbitrator found in favour of the firm and Musk, dismissing her claims, due to California’s statute of limitations - meaning too much time had passed since the alleged defamatory statements were made. Tesla brought the case back to a district court in California to have the decision confirmed. However, Ms Balan appealed this decision, and judges from the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found in her favour - in effect deciding the California court did not have the jurisdiction to make its judgement. They have ordered for the confirmation of the arbitration award to be cancelled, and for the district court to dismiss the action due to its lack of jurisdiction.

    "body": "2025/04/17 - Let’s dive into the details: A man who lost £1,000 worth of tools after being scammed by a fake banking app has said it makes you “lose faith in humanity”. The apps mimic legitimate mobile banking platforms and allow fraudsters to fake bank transfers in person, show the seller a “successful payment” message and then walk away, leaving sellers thousands of pounds out of pocket. Dr Tim Day, lead in doorstep crime and scams for the Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI), described the apps as an “emerging threat. ” He added: “The in-person nature of this scam is unusual. ” Victim Anthony Rudd said: “I found it absolutely sickening that you could look someone in the eye, shake their hand, and then rob them. ” About 500 reports of crimes involving fake banking apps have been made to Action Fraud in the past three years.

Now, BBC West Investigations have found versions of the apps available elsewhere online which can be downloaded directly to Android phones without the use of an official app store. Mechanic Mr Rudd was selling more than £1,000 worth of power tools on a social media platform when he received a message from a profile named Liam Wright. When “Mr Wright” said he was interested in viewing them, Mr Rudd invited him to come to his workshop in Salisbury, Wiltshire. After the man arrived, he checked over the tools, offered a bank transfer and opened what appeared to be a banking app. “He handed his phone over to me and I typed in my account details, clicked send, and it came up with a successful payment notification,” Mr Rudd said. “It looked absolutely genuine. ” While Mr Rudd was waiting for the money to appear in his bank account, he turned his back to pick up accessories to hand over as part of the sale. The scammer used this opportunity to leave with all the tools, but the money never arrived in Mr Rudd’s bank account. “He came into my workplace and took my tools,” Mr Rudd said. “It angered me so much that someone could be so brazen, but it’s also embarrassing that I allowed this to happen. ” Mr Rudd resigned from his job because he said the scam had “a huge impact” on his mental health. “You lose faith in humanity, that someone could be that low,” he said. Wiltshire Police told Mr Rudd it will not be taking any further action as it has been unable to identify the suspect since the incident on 11 February. It was a similar story for John Reddock, from Liverpool. He was selling a gold bracelet in the hope he could use the money to take his two children on holiday to Spain. He also used a social media platform to advertise the item, which he listed for £2,000. “I was trying to do something nice for my kids and it backfired on me,” said Mr Reddock. Two men arrived at his house to view the bracelet and decided they were happy to go ahead with the purchase, offering a bank transfer. Mr Reddock told them his bank account details and one of them typed it into what appeared to be a banking app on their phone. It then showed a payment successful notification. They left with the bracelet but Mr Reddock never received the money. “It’s given me nightmares and sleepless nights. I’m disgusted about what they’ve done to me,” he said. “It’s made me really angry because I was trying to do something good for my kids, and they came to my property to steal from me. ” Mr Reddock reported the incident to the police but no further action was taken.

    "title": "Update: Why China curbing rare earth exports is a blow to the US",
    "body": "2025/04/17 - According to new developments, As the trade war between China and the US escalates, attention has been focused on the increasingly high levels of tit-for-tat tariffs the two countries are imposing on one another. But slapping reciprocal tariffs on Washington is not the only way Beijing has been able to retaliate. China has now also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets, dealing a major blow to the US. The move has laid bare how reliant America is on these minerals. This week, Trump ordered the commerce department to come up with ways to boost US production of critical minerals and cut reliance on imports - an attempt by Washington to reclaim this critical industry. But why exactly are rare earths so important and how could they shake up the trade war? “Rare earths” are a group of 17 chemically similar elements that are crucial to the manufacture of many high-tech products. Most are abundant in nature, but they are known as “rare” because it is very unusual to find them in a pure form, and they are very hazardous to extract. Although you may not be familiar with the names of these rare earths - like neodymium, yttrium and europium - you will be very familiar with the products that they are used in. For instance, neodymium is used to make the powerful magnets used in loudspeakers, computer hard drives, EV motors and jet engines that enable them to be smaller and more efficient. Yttrium and europium are used to manufacture television and computer screens because of the way they display colours. “Everything you can switch on or off likely runs on rare earths,” explains Thomas Kruemmer, Director of Ginger International Trade and Investment. Rare earths are also critical to the production of medical technology like laser surgery and MRI scans, as well as key defence technologies. China has a near monopoly on extracting rare earths as well as on refining them - which is the process of separating them from other minerals. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that China accounts for about 61% of rare earth production and 92% of their processing. That means it currently dominates the rare earths supply chain and has the capacity to decide which companies can and cannot receive supplies of rare earths. Both the extraction and processing of these rare earths are costly and polluting. All rare earth resources also contain radioactive elements, which is why many other countries, including those in the EU, are reluctant to produce them. “Radioactive waste from production absolutely requires safe, compliant, permanent disposal. Currently all disposal facilities in EU are temporary,” says Mr Kruemmer. But China’s dominance in the rare earth supply chain didn’t take place overnight - but rather, is the result of decades of strategic government policies and investment. In a visit to Inner Mongolia in 1992, the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who oversaw China’s economic reform, famously said: “The Middle East has oil and China has rare earths”. “Beginning in the late 20th century, China prioritised the development of its rare earth mining and processing capabilities, often at lower environmental standards and labour costs compared to other nations,” said Gavin Harper, a critical materials research fellow at the University of Birmingham. “This allowed them to undercut global competitors and build a near-monopoly across the entire value chain, from mining and refining to the manufacturing of finished products like magnets. ” In response to tariffs imposed by Washington, China earlier this month began ordering restrictions on the exports of seven rare earth minerals - most of which are known as “heavy” rare earths, which are crucial to the defence sector. These are less common and are harder to process than “light” rare earths, which also makes them more valuable. From 4 April, all companies now have to get special export licenses in order to send rare earths and magnets out of the country. That is because as a signatory to the international treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, China has the ability to control the trade of “dual use products”. According to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), this leaves the US particularly vulnerable as there is no capacity outside China to process heavy rare earths. A US Geological report notes that between 2020 and 2023, the US relied on China for 70% of its imports of all rare earth compounds and metals. This means that the new restrictions have the ability to hit the US hard. Heavy rare earths are used in many military fields such as missiles, radar, and permanent magnets. A CSIS report notes that defence technologies including F-35 jets, Tomahawk missiles and Predator unmanned aerial vehicles all depend on these minerals. It adds that this comes as China “expands its munitions production and acquires advanced weapons systems and equipment at a pace five to six times faster than the United States”. “The impact on the US defence industry will be substantial,” said Mr Kroemmer. And it’s not only in the field of defence. US manufacturing, which Trump has said he hopes to revive through the imposition of his tariffs, stand to be severely impacted. “Manufacturers, particularly in defence and high-tech, face potential shortages and production delays due to halted shipments and limited inventories,” said Dr Harper. “Prices for critical rare earth materials are expected to surge, increasing the immediate costs of components used in a wide range of products, from smartphones to military hardware,” he says, adding that this could result in potential production slowdowns for affected US companies. If such a shortage from China persists in the long-run, the US could potentially begin diversifying its supply chains and scaling up its domestic and processing capabilities, though this would still require “substantial and sustained investment, technological advancements and potentially higher overall costs compared to the previous dependence on China”. And it’s clear this is something already on Trump’s mind. This week, he ordered an investigation into the national security risks posed by the US’ reliance on such critical minerals. “President Trump recognises that an overreliance on foreign critical minerals and their derivative products could jeopardise US defence capabilities, infrastructure development, and technological innovation,” said the order. “Critical minerals, including rare earth elements, are essential for national security and economic resilience. ” The US has one operational rare earths mine, but it does not have the capacity to separate heavy rare earths and has to send its ore to China for processing. There used to be US companies that manufactured rare earth magnets - until the 1980s, the US was in fact the largest producer of rare earths. But these companies exited the market as China began to dominate in terms of scale and cost. This is largely believed to be part of why US president Donald Trump is so keen to sign a minerals deal with Ukraine - it wants to reduce dependency on China. Another place Trump has had his eye on is Greenland - which is endowed with the eighth largest reserves of rare earth elements. Trump has repeatedly showed interest in taking control of the autonomous Danish dependent territory and has refused to rule out economic or military force to take control of it. These might have been places that the US could have sourced some of its rare earth exports from, but the adversarial tone Trump has struck with them means the US could be left with very few alternative suppliers. “The challenge the US faces is two-fold, on the one hand it has alienated China who provides the monopoly supply of rare earths, and on the other hand it is also antagonising many nations that have previously been friendly collaborators through tariffs and other hostile actions,” said Dr Harper. “Whether they will still prioritise collaboration with America remains to be seen in the turbulent policy environment of this new administration. ” "

    "title": "Latest: Why China curbing rare earth exports is a blow to the US",
    "body": "2025/04/17 - Here’s what you need to know: As the trade war between China and the US escalates, attention has been focused on the increasingly high levels of tit-for-tat tariffs the two countries are imposing on one another. But slapping reciprocal tariffs on Washington is not the only way Beijing has been able to retaliate. China has now also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets, dealing a major blow to the US. The move has laid bare how reliant America is on these minerals. This week, Trump ordered the commerce department to come up with ways to boost US production of critical minerals and cut reliance on imports - an attempt by Washington to reclaim this critical industry. But why exactly are rare earths so important and how could they shake up the trade war? “Rare earths” are a group of 17 chemically similar elements that are crucial to the manufacture of many high-tech products. Most are abundant in nature, but they are known as “rare” because it is very unusual to find them in a pure form, and they are very hazardous to extract. Although you may not be familiar with the names of these rare earths - like neodymium, yttrium and europium - you will be very familiar with the products that they are used in. For instance, neodymium is used to make the powerful magnets used in loudspeakers, computer hard drives, EV motors and jet engines that enable them to be smaller and more efficient. Yttrium and europium are used to manufacture television and computer screens because of the way they display colours. “Everything you can switch on or off likely runs on rare earths,” explains Thomas Kruemmer, Director of Ginger International Trade and Investment. Rare earths are also critical to the production of medical technology like laser surgery and MRI scans, as well as key defence technologies. China has a near monopoly on extracting rare earths as well as on refining them - which is the process of separating them from other minerals. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that China accounts for about 61% of rare earth production and 92% of their processing. That means it currently dominates the rare earths supply chain and has the capacity to decide which companies can and cannot receive supplies of rare earths. Both the extraction and processing of these rare earths are costly and polluting. All rare earth resources also contain radioactive elements, which is why many other countries, including those in the EU, are reluctant to produce them. “Radioactive waste from production absolutely requires safe, compliant, permanent disposal. Currently all disposal facilities in EU are temporary,” says Mr Kruemmer. But China’s dominance in the rare earth supply chain didn’t take place overnight - but rather, is the result of decades of strategic government policies and investment. In a visit to Inner Mongolia in 1992, the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who oversaw China’s economic reform, famously said: “The Middle East has oil and China has rare earths”. “Beginning in the late 20th century, China prioritised the development of its rare earth mining and processing capabilities, often at lower environmental standards and labour costs compared to other nations,” said Gavin Harper, a critical materials research fellow at the University of Birmingham. “This allowed them to undercut global competitors and build a near-monopoly across the entire value chain, from mining and refining to the manufacturing of finished products like magnets. ” In response to tariffs imposed by Washington, China earlier this month began ordering restrictions on the exports of seven rare earth minerals - most of which are known as “heavy” rare earths, which are crucial to the defence sector. These are less common and are harder to process than “light” rare earths, which also makes them more valuable. From 4 April, all companies now have to get special export licenses in order to send rare earths and magnets out of the country. That is because as a signatory to the international treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, China has the ability to control the trade of “dual use products”. According to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), this leaves the US particularly vulnerable as there is no capacity outside China to process heavy rare earths. A US Geological report notes that between 2020 and 2023, the US relied on China for 70% of its imports of all rare earth compounds and metals. This means that the new restrictions have the ability to hit the US hard. Heavy rare earths are used in many military fields such as missiles, radar, and permanent magnets. A CSIS report notes that defence technologies including F-35 jets, Tomahawk missiles and Predator unmanned aerial vehicles all depend on these minerals.

    "title": "Update: Firms say Meta not helping them to recover hacked accounts",
    "body": "2025/04/16 - Experts revealed that When wedding dress designer Catherine Deane saw her company’s Instagram account get hacked, she says it was “devastating”. “It felt like the rug had been pulled from under us. Instagram is our primary social platform, and we’ve invested the most amount of time and business resources into it. “To keep the account current we post content every day. Suddenly all this work… it was just pulled. ” Ms Deane’s UK-based business, which is named after her, sells wedding dresses online, with her biggest market being the US. On Instagram it now has 59,000 followers, but a few years ago the firm lost control of the account after a member of its social media team received a message suggesting that the business had been selected to get blue-badge verification from Instagram, which is owned by Facebook’s Meta. This was the stamp of authenticity that Ms Deane had long sought. “We were obviously very excited about that,” she says. So her employee opened a link to what turned out to be a fake Instagram verification form that requested log-in credentials. She filled it in, divulging the username and password, and shortly afterwards the account was taken over by hackers. What added to Ms Deane’s anguish was that she says she had to fight with Meta to get her account back, which took four months. Initially she filled out the admin dispute form and sent it off, but heard nothing. Multiple emails followed but no action was taken. “It’s so incredibly frustrating when you’re dealing with your account being hacked and there is no-one to talk to,” she says. “It’s almost traumatising because there is no-one who understands and can help escalate it. ” Eventually an email came from Meta, telling her that the case was closed, even though she was still unable to access her page. In the end the matter was finally resolved for Ms Deane because someone in the firm had a contact at Facebook, and the team emailed that person daily for the four months. “Finally, I think they just needed to get us off their backs and they reinstated the account,” says Ms Deane. According to Jonas Borchgrevink, boss of US-based cyber security firm Hacked. com, Ms Deane is far from a unique case among people with business accounts on Instagram and Facebook. “I would say that it is a massive problem,” says Mr Borchgrevink. “There are probably thousands every day that are losing their business pages. ” His company helps firms recover their Instagram and Facebook accounts, and he gets “10 to 15 clients per week”. “But those are just the ones that know about us and are able to pay the price, because these cases can take up to six months to sort. ” The BBC asked Meta to provide some numbers that would reveal the extent of the problem, and how it was tackling it, but it declined. However, it said in a statement, that “we take the safety and security of our community seriously and encourage everyone to create a strong password, enable two factor authentication and to be suspicious of emails or messages asking for personal details. “We also have a feature called Security Check-up to help people keep their Instagram and Facebook accounts secure. ” Hackers want to take over business social media accounts for a number of reasons. These including using the pages to sell fake products or place scam adverts, harvesting personal information, spreading malware, tricking people into sending money, or blackmailing the company in question to unblock the account. The final thing in that list happened last year to David Davila, who is part of the marketing team at Quantum Windows &amp; Doors, a small, family-run business based in Washington state in the US. He got locked out of the firm’s social Facebook account when he responded to what turned out to be a fake message purporting to be from Meta. Because his phone number was linked to the account, that also fell into the hands of the scammers and, soon after the lock-out, he got a WhatsApp message demanding $1,200 (£900) to unlock the account. Unable to find a helpline, he searched on Google, but the number he rang put him through to more scammers. That link has since been removed by Google. Thankfully, Mr Davila was able to get the Facebook account unlocked a few days later. Mr Borchgrevink believes that Meta is overwhelmed by the scale of the problem. “It has implemented different security measures over the years and yet we still receive the same amount of clients, so I don’t think there’s been a lot of change there,” he says. In fact, with scammers now utilising AI to make their messages seem even more believable, Mr Borchgrevink thinks the situation could get a lot worse. He tells the BBC that scammers are behind many of these lock-outs and one of their preferred methods of fooling people is to masquerade as customer support agents. “They pretend to be Meta Support and send the business an email saying that they have infringed some kind of copyright or broken terms and conditions in some way, and that they need to verify themselves. “The messages have the Facebook logo and are very believable. But when you start to verify your business page, they ask for the password and redirect you to a fake Meta site to steal log-ins. ” He said that the fraudsters often target a personal Facebook page first, because all business accounts need to be linked to one. “Your personal account will also have admin rights to your business account. The scammers go into your business account and transfer the admin rights to their own or to fake profiles. “Then they go back to your personal account and disable it by posting inappropriate content like terror-related or pornography-related. That disables your account and makes it really hard to recover either that or your business account. ” The BBC has also learned of businesses losing access to their Facebook and Instagram accounts despite them not being hacked. One small business which is part of franchise, told the BBC that they lost access to their account when another franchisee gained a blue-tick verification. As a result of that their account was flagged as a clone. Meanwhile, others, such as digital marketer Chetha Senadeera, say that Meta has wrongly closed business accounts. Last autumn he realised that a Facebook page he managed for a mobile bank had gone missing. “It had just disappeared,” he says. “There was no notification to me or any of the team members. It was just gone. It was like it had been kidnapped, almost. ” The page was a crucial gateway to customers across Europe for Lithuania bank MyTU. Mr Senadeera says that the customer support agents he spoke to at Meta, Facebook’s owner, were baffled. He says they told him that they could see the page, but that it had been restricted, and that they couldn’t unblock it. Six months later, and the page remains locked. Meta tells the BBC that the page had been removed for violating its scams policies, via a link on the page that was flagged by its systems as potentially harmful. Mr Senadeera disputes that the firm has ever posted any harmful or misleading content. He says that Meta needs to do more, and move more quickly, to help firms get their Facebook and Instagram pages back, whether they have been a victim of fraud or not. "

During the outage users reported they were still able to play music they had downloaded onto their device, however they were unable to view artists or use the search function on the app. After trying to search for music, the app appeared to time out and displayed a message reading “something went wrong” with a refresh button. “We’re aware of some issues right now and are checking them out,” the firm wrote on social media in response to rising complaints from users. On social media a number of users told the company they were unhappy with the outage, and the impact the loss of music was having. One urged the platform to hurry up and fix the issue as they were at the gym, while another pleaded for a quick fix as the loss of music was disrupting their revision. More significantly, some said they would switch to rival streaming platforms such as YouTube or Apple Music. "

During the outage users reported they were still able to play music they had downloaded onto their device, however they were unable to view artists or use the search function on the app. After trying to search for music, the app appeared to time out and displayed a message reading “something went wrong” with a refresh button. “We’re aware of some issues right now and are checking them out,” the firm wrote on social media in response to rising complaints from users. On social media a number of users told the company they were unhappy with the outage, and the impact the loss of music was having. One urged the platform to hurry up and fix the issue as they were at the gym, while another pleaded for a quick fix as the loss of music was disrupting their revision. More significantly, some said they would switch to rival streaming platforms such as YouTube or Apple Music. "

    "title": "New: Doctors in two end-of-life cases can be named",
    "body": "2025/04/16 - Let’s dive into the details: Doctors in two end-of-life cases can be named, the Supreme Court has ruled, after the parents of two children said they wanted to “tell their story”. Isaiah Haastrup, aged 12 months, and six-year-old Zainab Abbasi were at the centre of life support treatment disputes at the High Court in London before their deaths in 2018 and 2019 respectively. During the proceedings, court orders were put in place barring doctors involved in the children’s care from being publicly named indefinitely. Giving the ruling, President of the Supreme Court Lord Reed said the need for restriction of freedom of speech must be “established convincingly”, and that it was not by the NHS trusts in the case. Isaiah suffered “catastrophic” brain damage after being deprived of oxygen at birth and died in March 2018. Outside the court, Isaiah’s father Lanre Haastrup said the decision would “benefit the public at large”. “The court has emphatically stated no doctor can hide,” he said. ”It’s a great feeling that Isaiah’s life is not in vain. ” Zainab’s parents Rashid and Aliya Abbasi had raised concerns over the care at Newcastle’s Great North Children’s Hospital. Their daughter was born with a “rare and profoundly disabling” inherited neurodegenerative condition and died in September 2019. Zainab’s father Dr Abassi said: “We were brutally silenced both before and after Zainab’s death. “Now, after six years of fighting in courts, we are finally allowed to tell our story. ” Her mother Dr Abbasi said: “If something goes wrong, you should stand up and say, ‘Yes, this went wrong. ’ “I can’t imagine how much NHS money has been spent on this court case. ” A Court of Appeal ruling in 2023 - allowing the clinicians to be named - was challenged by the two trusts involved, in Newcastle and London. The case was heard at the UK’s highest court in April 2024. The Supreme Court unanimously dismissed the appeal. In the written judgment, Lord Reed and Lord Briggs said: “Weight can be given to the importance of protecting the medical and other staff of public hospitals against unfounded accusations and consequent abuse. “However, the court should also bear in mind that the treatment of patients in public hospitals is a matter of legitimate public interest. ” The court also declined an application from the trusts to continue the injunction for a further 21 days. The justices ruled that the doctors’ rights could not be asserted on their behalf and that the claim had to be brought by the clinicians themselves. The Court did not rule on how and when the naming should happen. Several families, including the parents of Indi Gregory and the mother of Archie Battersbee who were involved in similar high-profile legal battles, also attended the Supreme Court for the ruling. Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said it continued to extend its condolences to Zainab’s family and it would “take some time to consider the judgement”. “Throughout these proceedings, we have sought to act in the best interests of patients while protecting the rights of our staff to go about their professional duties and private lives without the potential threat of abuse or harassment. ” It added the ruling confirmed it was “appropriate and reasonable” for the trust to take this action. King’s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said it remained “sincerely sorry for the events surrounding Isaiah’s birth”. “We accept the ruling of the Supreme Court, and we will continue to support our staff through this change,” a spokesperson for the trust said.

    "title": "New: WHO agrees legally binding pandemic treaty",
    "body": "2025/04/16 - According to new developments, Members of the World Health Organization (WHO) have agreed the text of a legally binding treaty designed to better tackle future pandemics. The pact is meant to avoid the disorganisation and competition for resources seen during the Covid-19 outbreak. Key elements include the rapid sharing of data about new diseases, to ensure scientists and pharmaceutical companies can work more quickly to develop treatments and vaccines. For the first time, the WHO itself will also have an overview of global supply chains for masks, medical gowns and other personal protective equipment (PPE). WHO director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus described the deal as “a significant milestone in our shared journey towards a safer world”. “[Member states] have also demonstrated that multilateralism is alive and well, and that in our divided world, nations can still work together to find common ground, and a shared response to shared threats,” he said. The legally binding pact reached early on Wednesday came after three years of talks between member states. It is only the second time in the WHO’s 75-year history that an international agreement of this type has been reached – the first being a tobacco control deal in 2003. It still needs to be formally adopted by members when they meet for the World Health Assembly next month. US negotiators were not part of the final discussions after President Donald Trump announced his decision to withdraw from the global health agency, and the US will not be bound by the pact when it leaves in 2026. Under the terms agreed, countries will have to ensure that pandemic-related drugs are available across the world in a future outbreak. Participating manufacturers will have to allocate 10% of their production of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics to the WHO. Another 10% will then be supplied at “affordable prices”. Countries also approved the transfer of health technologies to poorer nations as long as it was “mutually agreed”. That should enable more local production of vaccines and medicines during a pandemic, but the clause had been extremely contentious. Developing countries are still angry at the way wealthy nations bought up and hoarded vaccines during Covid-19, while countries with large pharmaceutical industries worry mandatory transfers might undermine research and development. At the core of the agreement is a proposed Pathogen Access and Benefit-Sharing System (PABS), allowing the faster exchange of data between pharmaceutical companies. That should enable those firms to start working on new drugs more quickly in any future outbreak. "

    "title": "Latest: North Scotland among highest rates of Huntington's",
    "body": "2025/04/16 - Here’s what you need to know: Northern Scotland has one of the highest rates of Huntington’s disease in the world, according to a new study. Huntington’s is a hereditary disorder that slowly damages the brain, affecting the ability to walk, talk, eat, drink, make decisions and live independently. There is currently no cure. The study confirmed the rate of Huntington’s disease in northern Scotland is 14. 5 per 100,000 people - more than five times the estimated worldwide rate of 2. 71. The researchers from the University of Aberdeen found there are more than 160 adults living in Grampian, Highland, Orkney, Shetland, and the Western Isles who have the gene but have not been tested. Every child of someone affected has a 50:50 chance of inheriting the neurodegenerative gene which causes Huntington’s. On average, every person who has been diagnosed with Huntington’s disease will have at least another 2. 2 relatives who have the gene, meaning there are hundreds of people in northern Scotland who could be considered for effective treatments in the future, researchers said. Previous studies have mainly looked at the number of people who tested positive for the gene then estimated the number of relatives at risk using statistical modelling. In the new study, published in a peer-reviewed medical journal, scientists used family tree clinical records to count how many people have a 50:50 chance of having inherited the condition but have not been tested. It is hoped the findings can help affected families plan for the future and prompt future investment in specialist care. The chief executive of the Scottish Huntington’s Association, Alistair Haw, said specialist services were not an “optional extra” but rather an “absolute necessity”. “Specialist Huntington’s services need to be expanded urgently – a message further reinforced by this new and clear evidence which has major implications for health and social care providers throughout Scotland,” he said. The research was led by Prof Zosia Miedzybrodzka of the University of Aberdeen and clinical lead for Huntington’s disease at NHS Grampian, alongside Heather Cruickshank, genetic counsellor at NHS Grampian. They say the decision to be tested for the gene is entirely a personal choice.  While some people might want to know if they have inherited the Huntington’s gene, others prefer not to unless they develop symptoms. “Previous work looked at how many people in the area have been tested for Huntington’s disease, that is people diagnosed with Huntington’s disease signs and those with a gene alteration that will develop the condition in later life,” Prof Miedzybrodzka explained. “However, no-one has properly counted just how many people who haven’t been tested yet must have the gene. “It is crucial that we know this, and that it is accurate, so that health boards can properly plan for care and for treatments when they become available in the future. ” Heather Cruickshank said that despite high rates of testing, most people at risk of developing the disease in Scotland have not had a test. “There is a massive worldwide effort seeking treatments for Huntington’s disease,” she added. “Services need to plan to treat these as-yet-uncounted people, as well as those currently diagnosed. “Regional variations in rates will become more important, including genetic counselling and testing, management, and treatment delivery. ” She added: “Having a test remains a free choice for people from Huntington’s disease families and our research means that care can be planned for all those at risk, without people who don’t want a test having one. ” Brian Watt, 69, of Hopeman in Moray, is a former whisky distillery manager who received his diagnosis in 2016. “I knew there was Huntington’s disease in my family - my father and my sister were both diagnosed,” he said. “I wasn’t sure whether to go ahead with the test, but I am glad I did. ” Brian walks his two dogs along Hopeman beach every day. He believes keeping busy and having an upbeat outlook are vital when living with Huntington’s. “Zosia (Prof Miedzybrodzka) said to me the best way to manage Huntington’s disease is with a balance of lifestyle, attitude and medication and I think that is spot-on,” he said. “I try to keep a healthy lifestyle and positive attitude and I’m doing just fine. ” Sandy Patience, 62, of Inverness, was diagnosed with disease in 2017. He had lost relatives to the disease, and recalls the support of his wife Laura at the time. “I said to Laura ‘this is a game changer in our 20 years together - please can you leave me and live the rest of your life with someone else’. “But she didn’t, because her love for me is as immense as mine for her. We are very very blessed, and I can’t imagine life without my soulmate by my side - she picks me up if I am feeling down. ” He added: “This is a fantastic opportunity for other people, just like me, to take a big leap forward and consider testing. “I want everyone to know that testing positive is not the end of the world, it may even be the beginning of better family relationships and countless other positive things. ” Huntington’s disease is an inherited condition that stops parts of the brain working properly and is usually fatal within 20 years of the first appearance of symptoms. These include difficulty concentrating, depression, stumbling and clumsiness, involuntary jerking of the limbs and body, mood swings and personality changes, problems swallowing, speaking and breathing. They usually begin between the age of 30 and 50 and gradually get worse over time. There is currently no cure but treatment can help to deal with some of the symptoms. Source: NHS website "

We are very very blessed, and I can’t imagine life without my soulmate by my side - she picks me up if I am feeling down. ” He added: “This is a fantastic opportunity for other people, just like me, to take a big leap forward and consider testing. “I want everyone to know that testing positive is not the end of the world, it may even be the beginning of better family relationships and countless other positive things. ” Huntington’s disease is an inherited condition that stops parts of the brain working properly and is usually fatal within 20 years of the first appearance of symptoms. These include difficulty concentrating, depression, stumbling and clumsiness, involuntary jerking of the limbs and body, mood swings and personality changes, problems swallowing, speaking and breathing. They usually begin between the age of 30 and 50 and gradually get worse over time. There is currently no cure but treatment can help to deal with some of the symptoms. Source: NHS website "

    "title": "Big News: North Scotland among highest rates of Huntington's",
    "body": "2025/04/16 - Let’s dive into the details: Northern Scotland has one of the highest rates of Huntington’s disease in the world, according to a new study. Huntington’s is a hereditary disorder that slowly damages the brain, affecting the ability to walk, talk, eat, drink, make decisions and live independently. There is currently no cure. The study confirmed the rate of Huntington’s disease in northern Scotland is 14. 5 per 100,000 people - more than five times the estimated worldwide rate of 2. 71. The researchers from the University of Aberdeen found there are more than 160 adults living in Grampian, Highland, Orkney, Shetland, and the Western Isles who have the gene but have not been tested. Every child of someone affected has a 50:50 chance of inheriting the neurodegenerative gene which causes Huntington’s. On average, every person who has been diagnosed with Huntington’s disease will have at least another 2. 2 relatives who have the gene, meaning there are hundreds of people in northern Scotland who could be considered for effective treatments in the future, researchers said. Previous studies have mainly looked at the number of people who tested positive for the gene then estimated the number of relatives at risk using statistical modelling. In the new study, published in a peer-reviewed medical journal, scientists used family tree clinical records to count how many people have a 50:50 chance of having inherited the condition but have not been tested. It is hoped the findings can help affected families plan for the future and prompt future investment in specialist care. The chief executive of the Scottish Huntington’s Association, Alistair Haw, said specialist services were not an “optional extra” but rather an “absolute necessity”. “Specialist Huntington’s services need to be expanded urgently – a message further reinforced by this new and clear evidence which has major implications for health and social care providers throughout Scotland,” he said. The research was led by Prof Zosia Miedzybrodzka of the University of Aberdeen and clinical lead for Huntington’s disease at NHS Grampian, alongside Heather Cruickshank, genetic counsellor at NHS Grampian. They say the decision to be tested for the gene is entirely a personal choice.  While some people might want to know if they have inherited the Huntington’s gene, others prefer not to unless they develop symptoms. “Previous work looked at how many people in the area have been tested for Huntington’s disease, that is people diagnosed with Huntington’s disease signs and those with a gene alteration that will develop the condition in later life,” Prof Miedzybrodzka explained. “However, no-one has properly counted just how many people who haven’t been tested yet must have the gene. “It is crucial that we know this, and that it is accurate, so that health boards can properly plan for care and for treatments when they become available in the future. ” Heather Cruickshank said that despite high rates of testing, most people at risk of developing the disease in Scotland have not had a test. “There is a massive worldwide effort seeking treatments for Huntington’s disease,” she added. “Services need to plan to treat these as-yet-uncounted people, as well as those currently diagnosed. “Regional variations in rates will become more important, including genetic counselling and testing, management, and treatment delivery. ” She added: “Having a test remains a free choice for people from Huntington’s disease families and our research means that care can be planned for all those at risk, without people who don’t want a test having one. ” Brian Watt, 69, of Hopeman in Moray, is a former whisky distillery manager who received his diagnosis in 2016. “I knew there was Huntington’s disease in my family - my father and my sister were both diagnosed,” he said. “I wasn’t sure whether to go ahead with the test, but I am glad I did. ” Brian walks his two dogs along Hopeman beach every day. He believes keeping busy and having an upbeat outlook are vital when living with Huntington’s. “Zosia (Prof Miedzybrodzka) said to me the best way to manage Huntington’s disease is with a balance of lifestyle, attitude and medication and I think that is spot-on,” he said. “I try to keep a healthy lifestyle and positive attitude and I’m doing just fine. ” Sandy Patience, 62, of Inverness, was diagnosed with disease in 2017.

    "title": "New: Disposable vape use falling in UK ahead of ban",
    "body": "2025/04/16 - It has been recently reported that The popularity of disposable e-cigarettes or vapes has fallen ahead of a UK-wide ban on their sale on 1 June, a study suggests. The percentage of people aged 16-24 who mainly use disposable vapes has dropped by nearly half in the last year from 63% to 35%, University College London (UCL) researchers say. But researchers believe vape users are switching to refillable and rechargeable vapes in anticipation of the ban – instead of giving up. As a result they warn the ban may only have a “limited impact” on vaping rates as it found vaping in general stalled between January 2024 and 2025 in all adults over 16 after several years of significant growth. The UK government ban on disposable and single-use vapes is aimed at stopping littering as, in most cases, the vapes cannot be recycled and often end up in landfill or pollute natural environments. The ban is also aimed at tackling rising rates of youth vaping and protecting children from harm. GP Dr Helen Wall told BBC Breakfast that NHS advice is “very clear” that vaping should be used as a means to stop smoking. “But for people who have never smoked, and for young people particularly, to turn to vaping can be quite detrimental,” she said. “Our young people are becoming quite addicted. It’s affecting their concentration, they’re becoming agitated, their capacity to learn is affected, their developing brain can be affected. ” The UCL study looked at survey data on vaping habits in England, Wales and Scotland both before and after the ban was announced. The study used data from the Smoking Toolkit Study, which collected data on 88,611 people aged 16 and over. Before the ban, between January 2022 and January 2024, vaping among those aged 16 and over went up from 8. 9% to 13. 5%. In young adults aged 16-24, usage increased more sharply, from 17% to 26. 5%. After the ban was announced, researchers found a decline in the number of vapers mainly using disposable e-cigarettes - in all age groups and particularly among 16-24 year olds. The study only asked vape users about their main choice of device. Dr Sarah Jackson, who works for the UCL Tobacco and Alcohol Research Group and is the lead author of the survey, tells the BBC she thinks “more people are turning to refillable, reusable devices” rather than stopping vaping altogether. “We often see people change their behaviour in response to impending policy changes before they come into action,” she adds. Disposable vapes are single-use devices, which come pre-filled with vape liquid, whereas refillable and rechargeable (reusable) devices have a longer shelf-life and are often a cheaper way to vape in the long-term. A reusable vape has vape liquid that can be refilled and a battery that can be recharged. Dr Jackson adds that vape manufacturers have also been quick to react to the upcoming ban, with “the most popular” disposable brands producing rechargeable versions of their most popular models. “They’re very similar in design, colours, flavours and even price,” she says. While Dr Jackson thinks it’s too early to tell whether the government’s new strategy will deter young people from vaping, she maintains that health legislators face “an issue of balance”. “We know it makes sense to do something to try and reduce the vast numbers of young people taking up vaping, but the key public health priority here does remain smoking,” she says. “This is vastly more harmful and is killing a lot of people every year, so we need to make sure that any policy measures that are brought in to tackle youth vaping don’t put people off using vapes, which are very effective at quitting smoking,” she adds.

    "title": "Latest: The life, loss and legacy of Kevin Campbell",
    "body": "2025/04/15 - Here’s what you need to know: The life, loss and legacy of Kevin Campbell Kevin Campbell was the all-action, hard-grafting centre-forward who delighted football fans with great goals across a 19-year career at the top of the game. Affectionately known as Super Kev at Arsenal, Nottingham Forest and Everton, he developed a reputation as one of the hardest-to-handle forwards in the country, while his beaming smile and joyous celebrations made him one of English football’s most popular characters. “I think if you ask anyone who’s ever been in the presence of him, they’ll always remember him and speak about how good a person he was,” says Campbell’s son Tyrese, 25, who plays as a striker for Sheffield United. “He carried the whole room - you knew when he was in there because you could probably hear him. “He was a respectful, happy, positive person. You could even say almost too good for this Earth. A proper angel sent from heaven. ” In 2024 Kevin Campbell’s life was tragically cut short after he suffered a serious illness, and an investigation was launched into concerns over his care. After his inquest concluded on Monday, this is the story of Campbell’s life, loss and legacy, told by those who knew him best. The Life, Loss and Legacy of Kevin Campbell 15/4/2025 Campbell will eventually raise his own family in the north-west, but is born in south London in 1970, the second youngest of seven children in a family with Jamaican roots. “We were brought up by a single mother so resources were extremely tight,” Campbell’s younger sister Lorna says. “We used to play tennis against a back wall because we couldn’t afford to hire a court. Kevin wanted to be in different football teams and it was a struggle for my mother to pay all the subs. “We had three big brothers and he was never afraid to play football with them and their friends - he would just take them on. And this was on the mean streets of Brixton. That’s when he came alive. ” Kevin and his sister Lorna grew up playing sport together on the streets of Brixton Campbell begins to feel unwell. His symptoms are generic â tiredness, loss of appetite, a decrease in weight. Despite insisting that family and friends need not worry, in the following months he has multiple stays in hospitals in Greater Manchester. His appearance changes as he becomes visibly weaker. Doctors are unsure what is causing Campbell’s symptoms. According to an eventual inquest, he is discharged in March 2024 after “responding well to treatment”. World Football: The life, loss and legacy of Kevin Campbell 15/4/2025 This video can not be played ‘He carried a whole room’ - Family &amp; friends pay tribute to Campbell Campbell’s natural talent means he is scouted by multiple professional clubs in London, and he chooses to sign a youth deal at Arsenal. “When I joined Arsenal at 16, he was a young kid, about nine,” says Paul Davis, a midfielder with the Gunners between 1980 and 1995. “That’s when I started to hear his name â people saying ‘this guy is scoring plenty of goals’. “Then he came up to train with the first team. We see this big guy - six foot one, 17, wide, his legs are so thick and chunky. And everyone’s thinking, ‘Wow, no wonder he’s scoring goals’. He was just knocking everybody over. We had people like Kenny Sansom, Viv Anderson - senior internationals - and when they saw Kevin coming over they would be like ‘oh no’ because they knew he would embarrass them in training. “When I first came through I was the only black player at Arsenal. You’ve got to remember the culture of the country meant it was OK to tell off-colour jokes. So if you had somebody that was in the struggle with you, then it made it easier. “Kevin would always challenge things in a way that didn’t end up with a fight. He was able to do it and they thought, ‘actually, should I be saying this, or should I be doing this?’” Campbell was scouted by teams across London, but had supported Arsenal since his early childhood, and joined the Gunners as a teenager Andy Cole, the fourth top goalscorer in Premier League history, begins playing alongside Campbell when both are coming through the youth ranks at Arsenal. The pair combine in a successful FA Youth Cup campaign, and become friends. “Unbelievable strength and power,” Cole says of Campbell’s style. “He was quick as well. And to be fair Kevin didn’t have to be aggressive, because the size of him meant people feared him anyway. I think everyone enjoyed playing with him due to the fact that he worked so hard for his team. ” After making his first-team debut in 1988, Campbell wins two league titles as well as the FA Cup, League Cup, and European Cup Winners’ Cup in a seven-year spell with the Gunners in which his joyous goal celebrations and gregarious character make him a fan favourite. “Kevin had a larger than life personality,” Cole says. “He could walk into a room and light it up - life and soul of the party. “I remember one night Kevin took me out, we had a good laugh. Unfortunately for me I was in the next day and Kevin had the day off. We were doing stand runs at Highbury. Man, I couldn’t raise a gallop. “I remember [Arsenal youth-team coach] Pat Rice saw Kevin and said, ‘Kevin! Did you take Coley out last night?’ Kevin was like ‘Pfft, nah, I don’t know what you’re talking about, Pat. ’ I was just laughingâ¦ if Pat ever knew. ” Campbell’s condition worsens and he begins a long stay in Manchester Royal Infirmary. He has lost over half his body weight. Friends and family become aware that his illness is more serious than first believed. His friend Jason Lavelle says: “When I went to see him, I met his brothers beforehand and they did prep me for the fact that he had lost a lot of weight, that he wouldn’t look the same as what I remember him as. And that was the case. “In my mind’s mind I was still thinking ‘this is Kevin, Super Kevin, and he is seriously ill but he is still going to pull through this. ” Cole explains: “I got a phone call from someone saying ‘Coles, just letting you know that Kevin’s not very well’. “I knew mentally I couldn’t see him like that. I justâ¦ I couldn’t bring myself to see Kev in that state after knowing him being fit, strong. ” Eventually, the cause of Campbell’s illness is discovered. He is suffering from infective endocarditis, an infection in the inner lining of the heart or its valves which affects one in 30,000 people in the UK. “It’s often very difficult to diagnose,” says Dr Debbie Harrington, consultant aortic surgeon at Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital. “Often patients will present with very non-specific symptoms that have gone on for months. They won’t necessarily be seen by a specialist in cardiology who is going to think of the right diagnosis. ” “When we have problems where patients sadly don’t make it, often it’s because they get to us too late - that is usually the reason why patients don’t survive. “Overall in the general medical community I would say there is probably a lack of awareness of infective endocarditis - we know that it is actually on the increase. Definitely awareness is a big, big factor. ” After leaving Arsenal to play for Nottingham Forest in 1995, striking up a lethal striker partnership with Pierre van Hooijdonk, Campbell spends a brief spell with Trabzonspor in Turkey. But Campbell is racially abused by the club’s president after signing, and seven months later moves back to the Premier League, joining Everton. There, he becomes the club’s first black captain, scores crucial goals to keep the Toffees in the top flight, and mentors a young Wayne Rooney. “He was an inspiration, really,” Rooney says. “Everton were struggling for a few years and he galvanised the whole club. Campbell’s influence on a young Rooney had a marked impact “He helped me a lot - always talking to me throughout the game. As a young player you’re still learning, figuring out how to try and play the game, how to be in the right positions. “You see him play, you see his strengths, but actually playing with him he was a lot cleverer than I thought he was. Back then it was big man, small man up front. Obviously he was the big man and I was running off him - I did a lot of running for him!” Campbell sets up his own record label, 2 Wikid, and after playing for West Brom and Cardiff, he retires in 2007, embarking on a career in punditry and broadcasting. Infective endocarditis can be treated with antibiotics if diagnosed early. But the struggle for diagnosis in Campbell’s case means the infection has worsened, leading to kidney issues, a stroke and eventually fatal multi-organ failure. He dies on 15 June. “I was the one that got the call from the hospital to say that Kevin wasn’t going to make it, that he was having difficulty breathing,” Lorna says. “That was at five o’clock in the morning. Then it was my job to call the rest of the family and tell everybody the news. Those early days when Kevin passed were very, very difficult. ” Kevin coached his sons Kyle (left) and Tyrese (right), before both went on to become footballers Tyrese says: “Without saying it to each other, we knew it was coming. I’d say we prepared. We’re our Dad’s kids, so we’ve got his strength. We were relieved eventually when the day did come - he wasn’t in pain any more and we were at peace with that. I knew he wouldn’t have wanted to be that way and he could just rest. ” Campbell’s second son Kyle plays as a striker for Bootle FC. “It’s hard on the mind as well when you see someone so fit, so powerful, so loving, and you’re looking at him like ‘that’s not him’,” he says. “We never really lied to each other, never said ‘he’s going to come back perfect’, because sometimes in life, it doesn’t go your way. ” News of Campbell’s death is made public, shocking fans and former team-mates. Rooney says: “It was a massive loss for everyone in football, but for me personally obviously playing with him and knowing him as a person, I was devastated. ” Campbell’s popularity among team-mates was strong at every club he played for Manchester NHS Foundation Trust announces an investigation into the quality of care Campbell received in the run-up to his death. It is classed as a Level 5 patient safety incident. At the same time, an inquest is opened at Manchester Coroner’s Court. “When someone passes away you just want to be able to grieve knowing that it’s happened, that it’s disappointing it’s happened, but it ends there,” Cole says. “When you start hearing that there could possibly be this, possibly that, that just hurts even more. ” For Campbell’s sons, the investigation is rendered unimportant by the scale of their loss. “It can do whatever, but it’s not going to bring him back, so I don’t see the point in me investing my effort and energy,” Tyrese says. “For me, it wasn’t really going to change anything, so there’s not much point. ” The class is later reduced to a Level 2 patient safety incident, and the investigation determines that Campbell’s death was “possibly avoidable but not very likely”. The inquest, overseen by the coroner and including evidence given by two doctors involved in Campbell’s care, finds that he died of natural causes and adds that “missed opportunities” to correctly diagnose Campbell did “not more than minimally contribute to his death on the balance of probabilities”. The scrutiny over Campbell’s death and the handling of his illness comes against a backdrop of wider concern about standards of care in the NHS. “I think because of the significant financial trouble the NHS is in we have seen a marked decline in the quality of patient care,” says Dr Luke Munford, senior lecturer in health economics at the University of Manchester. “The NHS recommends that 90% of cardiac patients are seen within an 18-week timeframe. In Manchester at the moment that is 54%. ” “Manchester receives about Â£2. 6bn per year, which sounds like a lot, but when you divide that through by the population it serves it actually isn’t a great deal of money at all. “England does suffer from a postcode lottery. People in the north, even if they have substantial personal wealth, are at the mercy of the local health and care system. “If we look at budget cuts, austerity hit areas like Manchester much worse than areas in the south-east of England. ” Dr Munford adds that he is concerned there would be more examples of cases where complex illnesses go undiagnosed. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson tells the BBC: “Kevin Campbell was a huge inspiration, and our deepest sympathies are with his family and friends. “This government is overhauling our NHS so it works for all patients, no matter where they live and our fundamental shift from sickness to prevention will be vital in tackling health inequalities, making people healthier and reducing pressure on the NHS. “Under our Plan for Change, we are also prioritising patient safety and investing an extra Â£26 billion in the NHS to cut waiting lists and save lives. ” A spokesperson for Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust says: “We once again offer our deep condolences to the family and friends of Mr Campbell for their very great loss. It is clear from the inquest that everyone did their best to care for him, and there is no evidence that Mr Campbell’s death could have been avoided. “We are committed to constantly improving the quality of care we provide to our patients. Whilst there are aspects of Mr Campbell’s care that could have been improved, the Coroner has found that these did not more than minimally contribute to his sad death.

He definitely had a good time. ” "

    "body": "2025/04/15 - According to new developments, The life, loss and legacy of Kevin Campbell Kevin Campbell was the all-action, hard-grafting centre-forward who delighted football fans with great goals across a 19-year career at the top of the game. Affectionately known as Super Kev at Arsenal, Nottingham Forest and Everton, he developed a reputation as one of the hardest-to-handle forwards in the country, while his beaming smile and joyous celebrations made him one of English football’s most popular characters. “I think if you ask anyone who’s ever been in the presence of him, they’ll always remember him and speak about how good a person he was,” says Campbell’s son Tyrese, 25, who plays as a striker for Sheffield United. “He carried the whole room - you knew when he was in there because you could probably hear him. “He was a respectful, happy, positive person. You could even say almost too good for this Earth. A proper angel sent from heaven. ” In 2024 Kevin Campbell’s life was tragically cut short after he suffered a serious illness, and an investigation was launched into concerns over his care. After his inquest concluded on Monday, this is the story of Campbell’s life, loss and legacy, told by those who knew him best. The Life, Loss and Legacy of Kevin Campbell 15/4/2025 Campbell will eventually raise his own family in the north-west, but is born in south London in 1970, the second youngest of seven children in a family with Jamaican roots. “We were brought up by a single mother so resources were extremely tight,” Campbell’s younger sister Lorna says. “We used to play tennis against a back wall because we couldn’t afford to hire a court. Kevin wanted to be in different football teams and it was a struggle for my mother to pay all the subs. “We had three big brothers and he was never afraid to play football with them and their friends - he would just take them on. And this was on the mean streets of Brixton. That’s when he came alive. ” Kevin and his sister Lorna grew up playing sport together on the streets of Brixton Campbell begins to feel unwell. His symptoms are generic â tiredness, loss of appetite, a decrease in weight. Despite insisting that family and friends need not worry, in the following months he has multiple stays in hospitals in Greater Manchester. His appearance changes as he becomes visibly weaker. Doctors are unsure what is causing Campbell’s symptoms. According to an eventual inquest, he is discharged in March 2024 after “responding well to treatment”. World Football: The life, loss and legacy of Kevin Campbell 15/4/2025 This video can not be played ‘He carried a whole room’ - Family &amp; friends pay tribute to Campbell Campbell’s natural talent means he is scouted by multiple professional clubs in London, and he chooses to sign a youth deal at Arsenal. “When I joined Arsenal at 16, he was a young kid, about nine,” says Paul Davis, a midfielder with the Gunners between 1980 and 1995. “That’s when I started to hear his name â people saying ‘this guy is scoring plenty of goals’. “Then he came up to train with the first team. We see this big guy - six foot one, 17, wide, his legs are so thick and chunky. And everyone’s thinking, ‘Wow, no wonder he’s scoring goals’. He was just knocking everybody over. We had people like Kenny Sansom, Viv Anderson - senior internationals - and when they saw Kevin coming over they would be like ‘oh no’ because they knew he would embarrass them in training. “When I first came through I was the only black player at Arsenal. You’ve got to remember the culture of the country meant it was OK to tell off-colour jokes. So if you had somebody that was in the struggle with you, then it made it easier. “Kevin would always challenge things in a way that didn’t end up with a fight. He was able to do it and they thought, ‘actually, should I be saying this, or should I be doing this?’” Campbell was scouted by teams across London, but had supported Arsenal since his early childhood, and joined the Gunners as a teenager Andy Cole, the fourth top goalscorer in Premier League history, begins playing alongside Campbell when both are coming through the youth ranks at Arsenal. The pair combine in a successful FA Youth Cup campaign, and become friends. “Unbelievable strength and power,” Cole says of Campbell’s style. “He was quick as well. And to be fair Kevin didn’t have to be aggressive, because the size of him meant people feared him anyway. I think everyone enjoyed playing with him due to the fact that he worked so hard for his team. ” After making his first-team debut in 1988, Campbell wins two league titles as well as the FA Cup, League Cup, and European Cup Winners’ Cup in a seven-year spell with the Gunners in which his joyous goal celebrations and gregarious character make him a fan favourite. “Kevin had a larger than life personality,” Cole says. “He could walk into a room and light it up - life and soul of the party. “I remember one night Kevin took me out, we had a good laugh. Unfortunately for me I was in the next day and Kevin had the day off. We were doing stand runs at Highbury. Man, I couldn’t raise a gallop. “I remember [Arsenal youth-team coach] Pat Rice saw Kevin and said, ‘Kevin! Did you take Coley out last night?’ Kevin was like ‘Pfft, nah, I don’t know what you’re talking about, Pat. ’ I was just laughingâ¦ if Pat ever knew. ” Campbell’s condition worsens and he begins a long stay in Manchester Royal Infirmary. He has lost over half his body weight. Friends and family become aware that his illness is more serious than first believed. His friend Jason Lavelle says: “When I went to see him, I met his brothers beforehand and they did prep me for the fact that he had lost a lot of weight, that he wouldn’t look the same as what I remember him as. And that was the case. “In my mind’s mind I was still thinking ‘this is Kevin, Super Kevin, and he is seriously ill but he is still going to pull through this. ” Cole explains: “I got a phone call from someone saying ‘Coles, just letting you know that Kevin’s not very well’. “I knew mentally I couldn’t see him like that. I justâ¦ I couldn’t bring myself to see Kev in that state after knowing him being fit, strong. ” Eventually, the cause of Campbell’s illness is discovered. He is suffering from infective endocarditis, an infection in the inner lining of the heart or its valves which affects one in 30,000 people in the UK. “It’s often very difficult to diagnose,” says Dr Debbie Harrington, consultant aortic surgeon at Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital. “Often patients will present with very non-specific symptoms that have gone on for months. They won’t necessarily be seen by a specialist in cardiology who is going to think of the right diagnosis. ” “When we have problems where patients sadly don’t make it, often it’s because they get to us too late - that is usually the reason why patients don’t survive. “Overall in the general medical community I would say there is probably a lack of awareness of infective endocarditis - we know that it is actually on the increase. Definitely awareness is a big, big factor. ” After leaving Arsenal to play for Nottingham Forest in 1995, striking up a lethal striker partnership with Pierre van Hooijdonk, Campbell spends a brief spell with Trabzonspor in Turkey. But Campbell is racially abused by the club’s president after signing, and seven months later moves back to the Premier League, joining Everton. There, he becomes the club’s first black captain, scores crucial goals to keep the Toffees in the top flight, and mentors a young Wayne Rooney. “He was an inspiration, really,” Rooney says. “Everton were struggling for a few years and he galvanised the whole club. Campbell’s influence on a young Rooney had a marked impact “He helped me a lot - always talking to me throughout the game. As a young player you’re still learning, figuring out how to try and play the game, how to be in the right positions. “You see him play, you see his strengths, but actually playing with him he was a lot cleverer than I thought he was. Back then it was big man, small man up front. Obviously he was the big man and I was running off him - I did a lot of running for him!” Campbell sets up his own record label, 2 Wikid, and after playing for West Brom and Cardiff, he retires in 2007, embarking on a career in punditry and broadcasting. Infective endocarditis can be treated with antibiotics if diagnosed early. But the struggle for diagnosis in Campbell’s case means the infection has worsened, leading to kidney issues, a stroke and eventually fatal multi-organ failure. He dies on 15 June. “I was the one that got the call from the hospital to say that Kevin wasn’t going to make it, that he was having difficulty breathing,” Lorna says. “That was at five o’clock in the morning. Then it was my job to call the rest of the family and tell everybody the news. Those early days when Kevin passed were very, very difficult. ” Kevin coached his sons Kyle (left) and Tyrese (right), before both went on to become footballers Tyrese says: “Without saying it to each other, we knew it was coming. I’d say we prepared. We’re our Dad’s kids, so we’ve got his strength. We were relieved eventually when the day did come - he wasn’t in pain any more and we were at peace with that. I knew he wouldn’t have wanted to be that way and he could just rest. ” Campbell’s second son Kyle plays as a striker for Bootle FC. “It’s hard on the mind as well when you see someone so fit, so powerful, so loving, and you’re looking at him like ‘that’s not him’,” he says. “We never really lied to each other, never said ‘he’s going to come back perfect’, because sometimes in life, it doesn’t go your way. ” News of Campbell’s death is made public, shocking fans and former team-mates. Rooney says: “It was a massive loss for everyone in football, but for me personally obviously playing with him and knowing him as a person, I was devastated. ” Campbell’s popularity among team-mates was strong at every club he played for Manchester NHS Foundation Trust announces an investigation into the quality of care Campbell received in the run-up to his death. It is classed as a Level 5 patient safety incident. At the same time, an inquest is opened at Manchester Coroner’s Court. “When someone passes away you just want to be able to grieve knowing that it’s happened, that it’s disappointing it’s happened, but it ends there,” Cole says. “When you start hearing that there could possibly be this, possibly that, that just hurts even more. ” For Campbell’s sons, the investigation is rendered unimportant by the scale of their loss. “It can do whatever, but it’s not going to bring him back, so I don’t see the point in me investing my effort and energy,” Tyrese says. “For me, it wasn’t really going to change anything, so there’s not much point. ” The class is later reduced to a Level 2 patient safety incident, and the investigation determines that Campbell’s death was “possibly avoidable but not very likely”. The inquest, overseen by the coroner and including evidence given by two doctors involved in Campbell’s care, finds that he died of natural causes and adds that “missed opportunities” to correctly diagnose Campbell did “not more than minimally contribute to his death on the balance of probabilities”. The scrutiny over Campbell’s death and the handling of his illness comes against a backdrop of wider concern about standards of care in the NHS. “I think because of the significant financial trouble the NHS is in we have seen a marked decline in the quality of patient care,” says Dr Luke Munford, senior lecturer in health economics at the University of Manchester. “The NHS recommends that 90% of cardiac patients are seen within an 18-week timeframe. In Manchester at the moment that is 54%. ” “Manchester receives about Â£2. 6bn per year, which sounds like a lot, but when you divide that through by the population it serves it actually isn’t a great deal of money at all. “England does suffer from a postcode lottery. People in the north, even if they have substantial personal wealth, are at the mercy of the local health and care system. “If we look at budget cuts, austerity hit areas like Manchester much worse than areas in the south-east of England. ” Dr Munford adds that he is concerned there would be more examples of cases where complex illnesses go undiagnosed. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson tells the BBC: “Kevin Campbell was a huge inspiration, and our deepest sympathies are with his family and friends. “This government is overhauling our NHS so it works for all patients, no matter where they live and our fundamental shift from sickness to prevention will be vital in tackling health inequalities, making people healthier and reducing pressure on the NHS. “Under our Plan for Change, we are also prioritising patient safety and investing an extra Â£26 billion in the NHS to cut waiting lists and save lives. ” A spokesperson for Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust says: “We once again offer our deep condolences to the family and friends of Mr Campbell for their very great loss. It is clear from the inquest that everyone did their best to care for him, and there is no evidence that Mr Campbell’s death could have been avoided. “We are committed to constantly improving the quality of care we provide to our patients. Whilst there are aspects of Mr Campbell’s care that could have been improved, the Coroner has found that these did not more than minimally contribute to his sad death. We have already taken learning from Mr Campbell’s care and made improvements across the Trust, and we are committed to ongoing learning and improvement for all our patients. ” Campbell undertook regular charitable work during his life, and following his death his family sets up a foundation in his name which aims to improve the lives of young people by supporting them with funding, projects and activities. “The Kevin Campbell Foundation is an extension of Kevin,” Lorna says. “It allows us to celebrate Kevin as the footballer, and the amazing achievements he managed over 20 years as a footballer, but it also allows us to discover Kevin the man. ” Cole and Davis are among the Foundation’s ambassadors. “For someone who put themselves out for me so much when I was younger, it’s the least of things I could have done,” Cole says. “He was a selfless individual, always prepared to try and help.

The project is an expansion of Maria 01, a co-working and event space for entrepreneurs and investors, as well as larger corporations that want to collaborate with tech start-ups. Its existing facilities across the street already house around 240 start-ups. They are spread across six buildings that used to make up the city’s first hospital, founded in the 19th Century and notorious in Helsinki for treating patients with the plague. Now, the current 20,000 sq m site is a hub for companies developing innovative health technologies, alongside AI, cybersecurity, gaming and defence tech start-ups. “The whole place is really based on community,” says Maria 01’s CEO Sarita Runeberg. “We bring people together so they can network… and find different kinds of resources to grow their businesses. ” There are also office perks including a pool table, table football, running and ice bathing clubs, and in true Finnish-style, a sauna. “We wouldn’t be a proper start-up hub if we didn’t have our own sauna here!” laughs Ms Runeberg. While co-working spaces for tech companies are well established across the Nordics, Maria 01 is the largest of its kind in the region. It is run as a not-for-profit organisation partly funded by the city of Helsinki, which has invested more than €6m ($6. 7m; £5. 2m) in the hub since its launch in 2016. Ms Runeberg believes it will become the biggest start-up campus in Europe following the completion of three new buildings by 2028, adding a 50,000 sqm floor area. Later this year it is launching an accelerator programme designed to support and guide high-growth start-ups. The hub’s current and former members have already collectively raised over €1bn in funding. This represents around 40% of all early stage funding raised annually by Finnish start-ups. Ruben Byron is the Belgian co-founder of a start-up offering cloud services to AI developers. He has already scaled his business from a handful of staff using the hub’s hot desks to a team of around 40 working from private offices in the former hospital, as well as remotely. “That has been a great experience, that we’ve kind of been able [to] be nurtured here in a way,” he says. Although not as mature – or well known globally – as other European start-up hubs like Sweden and the UK, Finland has been steadily making a name for itself in the tech scene over the last two decades. The small Nordic nation, which has a population of around 5. 6 million, has spawned 12 unicorn businesses – firms worth a billion dollars or more – including sleep and fitness tracking ring Oura, game developers Supercell, Rovio (the creators of the Angry Birds game), and food delivery platform Wolt. Last year, Startup Blink, a global index mapping more than 100 countries ranked Finland’s start-up ecosystem the 7th best in western Europe, and 14th in the world. The index cites factors including hubs like Maria 01, alongside high levels of state and university support, and Slush - a huge annual non-profit gathering for global start-ups and investors. It also highlights Finland’s transparent and open business culture. “There is an authenticity with the Finns,” says Jack Parker, a Helsinki-based founder originally from Newcastle upon Tyne, who runs a healthcare innovation start-up. “Ego doesn’t really play a part. So if I reach out to somebody, it’s quite likely eight out of 10 times that they will respond. ” Finland’s right-wing coalition, which came into power in 2023, is on a mission to push the country even further up global indices, stating in its official government programme that it wants the Nordic nation to become a leader in fostering a dynamic start-up and growth company ecosystem. “It’s not just about rankings,” says Marjo Ilmari, who runs the start-up services team at Business Finland, the government agency that promotes investment and innovation. In 2024 Business Finland alone invested €112m in start-ups, an increase of 30% compared to the previous year. “The real goal is to create an environment where our ground-breaking start-ups can emerge and really tackle global challenges. ” The agency hopes this will help drive growth in the Finnish economy, which went into recession in 2023 and is currently making a sluggish recovery, with the Bank of Finland forecasting an increase of less than 1% this year. The country is also trying to attract more global talent by offering start-up permits for international founders who want to grow their businesses in Finland. These entrepreneurs are eligible for a so-called soft-landing support package provided by Business Finland. “They give you advice, support, sometimes grants to support the initiation phase,” explains Lalin Keyvan, a Turkish-born entrepreneur at Maria 01 who says the scheme was one of the main reasons why she relocated to Helsinki. Business Finland’s marketing campaigns for would-be movers highlight social and lifestyle factors too: Finns tend to prioritise wellbeing, plus there’s free education and subsidised healthcare and childcare. “You don’t really have to choose between building a high-growth company and enjoying life, because you can do both,” says Ms Ilmari. But whether all this is enough for Finland to compete with Europe’s more established start-up hubs is up for debate. Data suggests it still has a long way to go to catch up with neighbouring Sweden, long the Nordic darling of the European start-up scene. It is home to more than 40 unicorn businesses including Spotify, payments platform Klarna and game developer King. In Startup Blink’s ecosystem ranking Sweden ranks second in Europe after the UK, and top in the EU. In the last decade it has attracted more than $29bn in funding compared to just over $8bn in Finland, according to the annual State of European Tech report by investment company Atomico. “I love Finland’s bold approach,” says Charlotte Ekelund, deputy CEO of Sting, a non-profit organisation that helps develop start-ups in Stockholm. However she believes Finland is still years behind Sweden in terms of pulling in capital and developing its ecosystem. “We observe some of the things that the Finnish ecosystem is doing now, Sting was part of driving 10 or 15 years ago here - co-working spaces, [and] new organisations in the ecosystem that can support in different ways. ” Mikael Pentikainen, CEO of the Federation of Finnish Enterprises, says the country’s government is currently losing support amongst entrepreneurs despite its pro-start-up and pro-business approach. A recent survey for the organisation found 41% of small and medium-sized business owners are satisfied with the coalition’s actions, down from 54% in June. One likely reason for the dip, says Mr Pentikainen, is a decision to raise VAT from 24% to 25. 5% last September, the highest rate in western Europe. The government said this was a “difficult but necessary” move designed to stabilise public finances. But Mr Pentikainen suggests it could make Finland’s start-up ecosystem less competitive for international founders. The Finnish government has also recently toughened up citizenship requirements, meaning foreign entrepreneurs now need to stay at least eight years instead of five in order to obtain a passport, and will soon also be required to pass a test on Finnish society and culture if they want to settle long-term. Back at Maria 01, Mr Parker, the health company founder, says he’s confident Finland’s start-up ecosystem will continue to expand and attract international talent. But he warns it might lose some of the aspects that have so far made it an attractive option for entrepreneurs. “The advantage of the ecosystem right now is this kind of ‘small town, everybody knows each other’ [feeling]. Scaling that up, there is the risk of actually losing that element of it. ” "

    "title": "Update: Was China the reason Guyana faced higher Trump tariff?",
    "body": "2025/04/14 - Here’s what you need to know: The Caribbean nation of Guyana is breathing a sigh of relief after US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on the introduction of higher tariffs on a number of countries. Guyana, which is nestled between Venezuela and Suriname on the South American mainland, had been singled out for rates of 38% on many of its exports. Following Trump’s change in policy, it now faces tariffs of only 10% - the same as all countries apart from Canada, China and Mexico. But why had Guyana been facing a higher levy in the first place? Guyanese political commentator Francis Bailey says the country is caught in a geopolitical battle between the US and China. Or more specifically - Washington objects to Beijing’s “very strong foothold” in Guyana. Recent years have seen billions of dollars of investment in Guyana by Chinese entities, in everything from roads and hospitals, to hotels and shopping centres. And a crucial new bridge linking the capital Georgetown to the western region of Demerara-Mahaica is currently under construction by a Beijing-based company. For its part, the US continues to be happy to buy Guyana’s key exports of crude oil, gold and bauxite, which is the ore from which aluminium is extracted. These were all to be exempt from the planned 38% tariff, which instead would have hit Guyana’s fishing and sugar industries. The US also backs Guyana in its territorial dispute with Venezuela over the vast Essequibo region that forms the western two thirds of Guyana. During a visit to Georgetown in March, Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Venezuela of “consequences” if it were to use force against Guyana. But the planned high tariff showed Washington’s ire, says Mr Bailey. “I think the reason we had been given such high tariffs is to apply pressure on Guyana. “The US is saying, ‘if you want our protection you need to chase the Chinese out of your country’. Trump is a very transactional president – and Guyana is in a very precarious position against its sabre-rattling adversary Venezuela which has been ramping up acts of aggression. ” The Guyanese government did not respond to requests for comments. The country, once one of the poorest nations in the western hemisphere, and a former British colony, has been enjoying a surge in wealth since it first discovered oil in its territorial waters in 2015. Last year it exported $3. 13bn (£2. 4bn) of crude oil to the US, according to United Nations figures. Across the Caribbean all countries now face a 10% tariff on their exports to the US. However, it is the price impact of Trump’s global tariffs on what they import from the US that is of most concern. This is because the Caribbean’s love for, and reliance on, US products is immediately apparent when you glance at a High Street or supermarket shelf across the region. In fact, some islands are said to import as much as 70% of their consumer goods from their North American neighbour. And with American goods that rely on overseas raw materials or components set to go up in price, this will inevitably be passed on to consumers in the Caribbean. Also, much of what Caribbean nations buy from other countries around the world comes to them via the US. So with the White House now hitting Chinese goods coming into the US with tariffs of 125%, Chinese items that are then reexported to the Caribbean should see price hikes of a similar amount. And by around 10% for goods from other countries that arrive via the US. With already ever-increasing shipping costs in the Caribbean, and high local import duties causing exorbitant prices in a region beset by low wages, the impact of Trump’s tariffs could be profound and keenly felt. In Antigua and Barbuda, interior designer Carissa Warner tells the BBC that 70% of her materials are imported from the US, and 20% from China. “Some of my projects are on hold while we wait to see what happens,” she explains. “I am extremely worried from a business aspect but also just as a local consumer. “I’m so worried about the cost of food I have been looking online for pots to start growing fresh produce. I don’t think people realise the impact it will have on us. ” Ms Warner believes one way Caribbean governments could ease the squeeze on their people is by lowering their own import duties, which are partially calculated using a percentage of an item’s cost. Antigua and Barbuda’s Prime Minister Gaston Browne has dubbed global tariffs “extremely worrisome” and is urging citizens to “buy smarter and buy local”. Trump’s tariffs come as the Caribbean is already grappling with a confluence of harsh economic conditions from the cost of cleaning up after frequent natural disasters like hurricanes, to the aftereffects of the Covid pandemic. Antigua and Barbuda’s ambassador to the US, Sir Ronald Sanders, says that the US has long enjoyed a trade surplus with most Caribbean countries. “For decades, we have helped sustain American prosperity by collectively importing far more from the United States than we export,” he says. “The problem we have created for ourselves is that we have been dependent on the US market for such a long time and have not sought to diversify into other markets. ” As for the 10% tariff on Caribbean exports to the US, Sir Ronald says: “Any loss is not a good thing for our small economies, but the 10% that we face is not going to disrupt our goods from going to the US market. ” The Caribbean islands’ small market sizes, high labour costs and remoteness from principle markets has kept their manufacturing sectors relatively modest. Their exports include many niche products like specialist rums and indigenous foods such as ackee, a fruit from Jamaica. “These kinds of products are all orientated to a certain kind of market and will not face any competition because the US does not produce them, and the countries that do face their own tariffs,” Sir Ronald continues. Exacerbating worries in the Caribbean are potential additional taxes on Chinese-built ships entering US ports of up to $1. 5m per docking. This idea was mooted by the White House in February. Many fear that will aggravate freight costs in the Caribbean, and lead to further hikes in the price of everyday goods, given the large volume of items sold in the region that are manufactured in China. Sir Ronald adds that tacking the problem of an overreliance on the US “can only come from diversifying the market, but that’s not an overnight achievement”. He adds: “It’s not as easy to set up new markets as people think. It’s not governments who control trade; it’s the private sector. And much of what we buy will still come via the US. ” Many Caribbean leaders feel the best strategy to thwart the fallout from tariffs is to negotiate as a bloc. Mia Mottley, chair of the intergovernmental group Caricom, said the region was facing the most challenging of times since its 15 member states gained independence several decades ago. “We are working and will continue to work to become more self-sufficient, but… this trade war will mean higher prices for all of us,” she said in a recent statement. Ms Mottley added that it was vital to redouble efforts to “invest in Caribbean agricultural production and light manufacturing”. “We must build our ties with Africa, Central and Latin America, and renew those ties with some of our older partners around the world, in the United Kingdom and Europe, and in Canada. We must not rely solely on one or two markets. ” Ms Mottley, who is also the prime minister of Barbados, is calling for Washington to “work with” the Caribbean to keep prices down. She added: “To the United States, I say this simply: ‘We are not your enemy. We are your friends’. ” "

This is because the Caribbean’s love for, and reliance on, US products is immediately apparent when you glance at a High Street or supermarket shelf across the region. In fact, some islands are said to import as much as 70% of their consumer goods from their North American neighbour. And with American goods that rely on overseas raw materials or components set to go up in price, this will inevitably be passed on to consumers in the Caribbean. Also, much of what Caribbean nations buy from other countries around the world comes to them via the US. So with the White House now hitting Chinese goods coming into the US with tariffs of 125%, Chinese items that are then reexported to the Caribbean should see price hikes of a similar amount. And by around 10% for goods from other countries that arrive via the US. With already ever-increasing shipping costs in the Caribbean, and high local import duties causing exorbitant prices in a region beset by low wages, the impact of Trump’s tariffs could be profound and keenly felt. In Antigua and Barbuda, interior designer Carissa Warner tells the BBC that 70% of her materials are imported from the US, and 20% from China. “Some of my projects are on hold while we wait to see what happens,” she explains. “I am extremely worried from a business aspect but also just as a local consumer. “I’m so worried about the cost of food I have been looking online for pots to start growing fresh produce. I don’t think people realise the impact it will have on us. ” Ms Warner believes one way Caribbean governments could ease the squeeze on their people is by lowering their own import duties, which are partially calculated using a percentage of an item’s cost. Antigua and Barbuda’s Prime Minister Gaston Browne has dubbed global tariffs “extremely worrisome” and is urging citizens to “buy smarter and buy local”. Trump’s tariffs come as the Caribbean is already grappling with a confluence of harsh economic conditions from the cost of cleaning up after frequent natural disasters like hurricanes, to the aftereffects of the Covid pandemic. Antigua and Barbuda’s ambassador to the US, Sir Ronald Sanders, says that the US has long enjoyed a trade surplus with most Caribbean countries. “For decades, we have helped sustain American prosperity by collectively importing far more from the United States than we export,” he says. “The problem we have created for ourselves is that we have been dependent on the US market for such a long time and have not sought to diversify into other markets. ” As for the 10% tariff on Caribbean exports to the US, Sir Ronald says: “Any loss is not a good thing for our small economies, but the 10% that we face is not going to disrupt our goods from going to the US market. ” The Caribbean islands’ small market sizes, high labour costs and remoteness from principle markets has kept their manufacturing sectors relatively modest. Their exports include many niche products like specialist rums and indigenous foods such as ackee, a fruit from Jamaica. “These kinds of products are all orientated to a certain kind of market and will not face any competition because the US does not produce them, and the countries that do face their own tariffs,” Sir Ronald continues. Exacerbating worries in the Caribbean are potential additional taxes on Chinese-built ships entering US ports of up to $1. 5m per docking. This idea was mooted by the White House in February. Many fear that will aggravate freight costs in the Caribbean, and lead to further hikes in the price of everyday goods, given the large volume of items sold in the region that are manufactured in China. Sir Ronald adds that tacking the problem of an overreliance on the US “can only come from diversifying the market, but that’s not an overnight achievement”. He adds: “It’s not as easy to set up new markets as people think. It’s not governments who control trade; it’s the private sector. And much of what we buy will still come via the US. ” Many Caribbean leaders feel the best strategy to thwart the fallout from tariffs is to negotiate as a bloc. Mia Mottley, chair of the intergovernmental group Caricom, said the region was facing the most challenging of times since its 15 member states gained independence several decades ago. “We are working and will continue to work to become more self-sufficient, but… this trade war will mean higher prices for all of us,” she said in a recent statement. Ms Mottley added that it was vital to redouble efforts to “invest in Caribbean agricultural production and light manufacturing”. “We must build our ties with Africa, Central and Latin America, and renew those ties with some of our older partners around the world, in the United Kingdom and Europe, and in Canada. We must not rely solely on one or two markets. ” Ms Mottley, who is also the prime minister of Barbados, is calling for Washington to “work with” the Caribbean to keep prices down. She added: “To the United States, I say this simply: ‘We are not your enemy. We are your friends’. ” "

    "body": "2025/04/14 - Let’s dive into the details: The Caribbean nation of Guyana is breathing a sigh of relief after US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on the introduction of higher tariffs on a number of countries. Guyana, which is nestled between Venezuela and Suriname on the South American mainland, had been singled out for rates of 38% on many of its exports. Following Trump’s change in policy, it now faces tariffs of only 10% - the same as all countries apart from Canada, China and Mexico. But why had Guyana been facing a higher levy in the first place? Guyanese political commentator Francis Bailey says the country is caught in a geopolitical battle between the US and China. Or more specifically - Washington objects to Beijing’s “very strong foothold” in Guyana. Recent years have seen billions of dollars of investment in Guyana by Chinese entities, in everything from roads and hospitals, to hotels and shopping centres. And a crucial new bridge linking the capital Georgetown to the western region of Demerara-Mahaica is currently under construction by a Beijing-based company. For its part, the US continues to be happy to buy Guyana’s key exports of crude oil, gold and bauxite, which is the ore from which aluminium is extracted. These were all to be exempt from the planned 38% tariff, which instead would have hit Guyana’s fishing and sugar industries. The US also backs Guyana in its territorial dispute with Venezuela over the vast Essequibo region that forms the western two thirds of Guyana. During a visit to Georgetown in March, Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Venezuela of “consequences” if it were to use force against Guyana. But the planned high tariff showed Washington’s ire, says Mr Bailey. “I think the reason we had been given such high tariffs is to apply pressure on Guyana. “The US is saying, ‘if you want our protection you need to chase the Chinese out of your country’. Trump is a very transactional president – and Guyana is in a very precarious position against its sabre-rattling adversary Venezuela which has been ramping up acts of aggression. ” The Guyanese government did not respond to requests for comments. The country, once one of the poorest nations in the western hemisphere, and a former British colony, has been enjoying a surge in wealth since it first discovered oil in its territorial waters in 2015. Last year it exported $3. 13bn (£2. 4bn) of crude oil to the US, according to United Nations figures. Across the Caribbean all countries now face a 10% tariff on their exports to the US.

    "title": "Breaking: The curious case of why a billionaire wants to buy Royal Mail",
    "body": "2025/04/13 - Here’s what you need to know: From the end of April, the 500-year-old Royal Mail will be controlled by a Czech billionaire who co-owns a football club and is a major investor in a British supermarket - so, why would he want this ailing institution? “A pair of scissors, one empty teapot and some hot water, please. ” The slightly baffled staff at Claridge’s scrambled to comply with Daniel Kretinsky’s breakfast order as he sanitised and moisturised his hands. The upscale hotel has been serving tea to the global elite for decades but Mr Kretinsky brought along his own packet of Chinese green tea, which he snipped open (hence the scissors) and poured into the empty pot. He was tall, perfectly groomed, steely-eyed but unfalteringly polite and thoughtful. If you told anyone in the dining room he was a billionaire, they would have no problem believing it. Known as the Czech Sphinx for his enigmatic style, Mr Kretinsky, who is 49, is worth £6bn according to the Sunday Times Rich List. He lives in plush mansions in Paris and London, was originally a lawyer and made his fortune in European energy markets. Our meeting was at Claridge’s in June 2024 - I was trying to convince him to give me an interview about his audacious attempt to buy a British institution that was once seen as a national treasure: Royal Mail. His profile as a buyer was one that unions and ministers typically would be wary of because of his historic connections with Russia - his companies own a gas pipeline that has transported Russian gas to Europe. But six months on, his bid to buy Royal Mail’s parent company was cleared by the UK government after he agreed “legally binding” undertakings. The government was awarded a so-called “golden share”, requiring it to be notified of any major changes to Royal Mail’s ownership, headquarters location and tax residency. The deal was also blessed by unions. Earlier this month, the owner of Royal Mail said that the takeover could be completed by the end of April as the deal cleared the final regulatory hurdles standing in the way. But step back and Royal Mail seems a strange target for a globally mobile oil and gas billionaire investor to set his sights on. It begs the question why would anyone, let alone a successful international entrepreneur, want to buy this faded relic? Royal Mail was founded by Henry VIII more than 500 years ago and still carries the royal cipher on its vans. It is part of the fabric of British life and many people still have a fond relationship with their ‘postie’, who walks down their path bringing their letters and parcels to their door. But in recent years Royal Mail’s crown has slipped. It is losing money and market share, has been fined for missing delivery targets and has made an enemy of its own workforce through a series of bitter strikes. Royal Mail’s letter business is in steep decline too. It has gone from a peak of 20 billion letters sent in 2004 to under seven billion sent last year. In December 2024, it was fined £10. 5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail. While the boom in e-commerce has seen the volume of parcels rise, Royal Mail’s share of that more profitable business has been falling as new competitors like DPD, DHL, Amazon and Evri have eaten into its market share. Royal Mail was split off from the Post Office in 2012 and privatised in 2013 at a value of £3. 3bn. Its shares immediately rocketed by 38% on the first day of trading, leading to criticism - from the National Audit Office, among others - that it had been sold on the cheap. At its peak in Covid-era May 2021, the company was worth more than £6bn but had slumped to just over £2bn when Mr Kretinsky launched his takeover bid last April. He sealed the deal at £3. 6bn - 63% higher than before he signalled his intent, but barely more than it was worth at privatisation over a decade ago. “Royal Mail is a business that has historically found it difficult to grow revenues by more than costs,” says Alex Paterson, an analyst at Peel Hunt stockbrokers. “It has seen its parcels market share eroded by more dynamic competition that has been able to invest more in technology, and it has struggled with industrial relations to keep staff working towards a common goal. “This is not a challenge to underestimate nor one that can be overcome quickly, but that requires considerable long-term investment in infrastructure, technology and staff. ” Part of the challenge, and one that puts Royal Mail at a disadvantage compared with its rivals, is that unlike them, Royal Mail has to meet a string of legal and regulatory obligations, says Hazel King, the editor of Parcel and Post Technology International. Under what is called the universal service obligation (USO), Royal Mail is required by law to deliver letters six days a week and parcels five days a week to every address in the UK. So it cannot pick and choose which business it wants to do. “Royal Mail must meet their universal service obligation while trying to compete with private firms who often cherry-pick the most profitable business,” says Ms King. Mr Kretinsky says he has a plan. His success in the energy sector allowed him to buy a 27. 5% stake in Royal Mail’s parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS). And his company – EP Group – intends to build a pan-European conglomerate built on three pillars: energy, retail and logistics. He sees IDS as the cornerstone of the logistics pillar, with a plan to go toe-to-toe with the likes of Deutsche Post DHL, DPD and Amazon. The USO has been under review by Ofcom, with Royal Mail hoping that the regulator will reduce the requirement to deliver second-class letters from six days a week to every other weekday. That single move could save Royal Mail £300m a year – putting it back on a break-even footing. Mr Kretinsky told me during our interview that he would honour the USO “as long as I am alive”, but he is unsurprisingly very much in favour of changing its terms. He said he hopes that “rational minds prevail” when reforming a service that is unsustainable in its current form. So far, the noises from Ofcom seem to be supportive. The regulator’s chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC there were “real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future”. Given letter numbers are falling, “we have to think about what is economical”, she said, adding Ofcom would be publishing plans for the regulation of Royal Mail “to make sure it is sustainable”. While Royal Mail generally welcomed the proposed changes to the Universal Service Obligation, Royal Mail pushed back against proposed new delivery time and business customer requirements. Royal Mail said last week that the level at which Ofcom is proposing to set the new delivery targets – 99. 5% of First Class letters delivered within three days, and the same percentage of Second Class letters within five – is “over specified and will add significant cost to the delivery of the Universal Service”. It also expressed concerns that proposals to add a new category of regulation to ensure timely delivery for business users like direct mail companies “goes against the wider government drive to reduce unnecessary regulation”. But there are other factors that may have driven the sale. Some analysts have speculated that there is another jewel in the crown of IDS - and that Mr Kretinsky may really be after a different part of the business. Along with Royal Mail, IDS also owns a European parcels business called GLS which it acquired in 1999 – long before Royal Mail was split off from the Post Office and privatised. Last year GLS made a profit of £320m, compared to Royal Mail, which lost £348m as letter volumes continued to plunge and new competitors ate into its market share of the more profitable parcels business. “GLS has been a profitable growth business, which has seen investment whereas Royal Mail has been a perpetual underperformer, as the board of parent company IDS has invested where it thinks it will see the best returns,” says Mr Paterson. Mr Kretinsky rejects suggestions from some quarters that he wants to break up the group and has committed to keeping it together for at least five years. Even beyond that, he says the plan is to grow the company rather than shrink it, so a disposal of GLS would be “nonsensical”. In fact, Mr Kretinsky says he hopes to bring the European parcel know-how at GLS to bear on Royal Mail’s operations. What the unions are hoping, and Kretinsky is promising, is that Royal Mail will see greater investment and over time begin to look a bit more like GLS and its European counterparts such as Deutche Post DHL. Given all the challenges Royal Mail faces, there’s an obvious question - why would a billionaire want to chance his arm on turning round something that others couldn’t, while up against powerful competitors? Well, if you believe as Kretinsky does - and he is surely right - that getting parcels to people is a profitable and growing industry, then buying Royal Mail and GLS gives you a way to become a big European player in logistics quickly. Add to that a powerful and historic brand, a database with every single UK address and a frontline workforce that most of its customers are fond of and pleased to see when they walk down the path - then, despite the challenges, it begins to make sense. Mr Kretinsky is convinced future growth lies in out-of-home (OOH) delivery. The parcel lockers found in supermarket car parks and elsewhere, operated by the likes of Amazon, Evri and UPS, have grown quickly across Europe. Earlier this month it was reported that Sainsbury’s would be the first supermarket to partner with Royal Mail and install parcel lockers at supermarkets. Some are already operating at several stores including ones in Clapham, Kidderminster and Chislehurst. Royal Mail has also trialled a new postbox that can take small parcels. Customers procure a barcode from an app, then at the postbox they scan the barcode and drop the parcel into a drawer - this is all powered by solar panels on the box. Emma Gilthorpe, Royal Mail chief executive, called it an “historic change” to give postboxes “a new lease of life”. All of this boils down to the same thing: convenience. It means customers don’t have to wait at home for a delivery - the sender or parcel business emails or texts a code to unlock the locker. For the business it’s more efficient, allowing couriers to deliver lots of parcels to one place - meaning fewer miles on the road and less time. “If they can grow the parcels business and claw back market share, there is every chance that they can add new jobs that could offset the reduction in jobs in the declining letters business,” says Mr Paterson. “There is a significant long-term opportunity to run Royal Mail more successfully with regulatory changes to the USO and greater investment in technology and out-of-home deliveries. ” But Royal Mail still has a lot of catching up to do with its competitors. It currently has 1,500 lockers in the UK and aims to grow this figure to at least 20,000 over time. By contrast, Amazon already has 5,000 lockers across the UK and InPost has 7,500 across the UK. That Mr Kretinsky has pulled off the takeover is no easy feat. Royal Mail is, after all, considered vital national infrastructure and as such the deal required review under national security laws. Then there is the fact that his companies own a gas pipeline that has transported Russian gas to Europe – paid for and approved by EU member states. The small amount that was transported was reduced to zero at the end of 2024 when Ukraine refused to renew permission for any gas to flow across its borders. Speaking in front of MPs in November, UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds referred to Mr Kretinsky as a “legitimate business figure” whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company two years ago. Getting the unions on board seemed even more of a challenge and the Communication Workers Union was wary of Mr Kretinsky. “The CWU believes Royal Mail should be in public hands,” Dave Ward, the CWU’s general secretary, told the BBC in June. “We know there are legitimate concerns about Royal Mail Group being owned by a foreign private equity investor. ” But during negotiations, union representatives secured a series of time-limited commitments from him, including guarantees that he will protect Royal Mail’s pension surplus, that there will be no compulsory redundancies for two years, no sell-off or break-up of any operational part of the existing company and no outsourcing of grades represented by the CWU. Mr Kretinsky also agreed to restrictions on moving dividends out of Royal Mail Group and to respect agreements with and recognition of the CWU. He said he would keep the brand name and Royal Mail’s headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years. Union bosses told me that a life under Mr Kretinsky “couldn’t be any worse than what we have had for the last 10 years”. So, as Mr Kretinsky looks certain to pull off the sale, what will customers notice? The frequency of second-class deliveries may be reduced after the Ofcom review. We will see new Royal Mail lockers appearing in our neighbourhoods. And the price of first-class mail may go up: second-class stamps are regulated by Ofcom, while first-class ones are not. The monarch’s head will still be on those stamps, but there is a new king of our mail system. And his name is Daniel Kretinsky.

    "body": "2025/04/13 - According to new developments, From the end of April, the 500-year-old Royal Mail will be controlled by a Czech billionaire who co-owns a football club and is a major investor in a British supermarket - so, why would he want this ailing institution? “A pair of scissors, one empty teapot and some hot water, please. ” The slightly baffled staff at Claridge’s scrambled to comply with Daniel Kretinsky’s breakfast order as he sanitised and moisturised his hands. The upscale hotel has been serving tea to the global elite for decades but Mr Kretinsky brought along his own packet of Chinese green tea, which he snipped open (hence the scissors) and poured into the empty pot. He was tall, perfectly groomed, steely-eyed but unfalteringly polite and thoughtful. If you told anyone in the dining room he was a billionaire, they would have no problem believing it. Known as the Czech Sphinx for his enigmatic style, Mr Kretinsky, who is 49, is worth £6bn according to the Sunday Times Rich List. He lives in plush mansions in Paris and London, was originally a lawyer and made his fortune in European energy markets. Our meeting was at Claridge’s in June 2024 - I was trying to convince him to give me an interview about his audacious attempt to buy a British institution that was once seen as a national treasure: Royal Mail. His profile as a buyer was one that unions and ministers typically would be wary of because of his historic connections with Russia - his companies own a gas pipeline that has transported Russian gas to Europe. But six months on, his bid to buy Royal Mail’s parent company was cleared by the UK government after he agreed “legally binding” undertakings. The government was awarded a so-called “golden share”, requiring it to be notified of any major changes to Royal Mail’s ownership, headquarters location and tax residency. The deal was also blessed by unions. Earlier this month, the owner of Royal Mail said that the takeover could be completed by the end of April as the deal cleared the final regulatory hurdles standing in the way. But step back and Royal Mail seems a strange target for a globally mobile oil and gas billionaire investor to set his sights on. It begs the question why would anyone, let alone a successful international entrepreneur, want to buy this faded relic? Royal Mail was founded by Henry VIII more than 500 years ago and still carries the royal cipher on its vans. It is part of the fabric of British life and many people still have a fond relationship with their ‘postie’, who walks down their path bringing their letters and parcels to their door. But in recent years Royal Mail’s crown has slipped. It is losing money and market share, has been fined for missing delivery targets and has made an enemy of its own workforce through a series of bitter strikes. Royal Mail’s letter business is in steep decline too. It has gone from a peak of 20 billion letters sent in 2004 to under seven billion sent last year. In December 2024, it was fined £10. 5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail. While the boom in e-commerce has seen the volume of parcels rise, Royal Mail’s share of that more profitable business has been falling as new competitors like DPD, DHL, Amazon and Evri have eaten into its market share. Royal Mail was split off from the Post Office in 2012 and privatised in 2013 at a value of £3. 3bn. Its shares immediately rocketed by 38% on the first day of trading, leading to criticism - from the National Audit Office, among others - that it had been sold on the cheap. At its peak in Covid-era May 2021, the company was worth more than £6bn but had slumped to just over £2bn when Mr Kretinsky launched his takeover bid last April. He sealed the deal at £3. 6bn - 63% higher than before he signalled his intent, but barely more than it was worth at privatisation over a decade ago. “Royal Mail is a business that has historically found it difficult to grow revenues by more than costs,” says Alex Paterson, an analyst at Peel Hunt stockbrokers. “It has seen its parcels market share eroded by more dynamic competition that has been able to invest more in technology, and it has struggled with industrial relations to keep staff working towards a common goal. “This is not a challenge to underestimate nor one that can be overcome quickly, but that requires considerable long-term investment in infrastructure, technology and staff. ” Part of the challenge, and one that puts Royal Mail at a disadvantage compared with its rivals, is that unlike them, Royal Mail has to meet a string of legal and regulatory obligations, says Hazel King, the editor of Parcel and Post Technology International. Under what is called the universal service obligation (USO), Royal Mail is required by law to deliver letters six days a week and parcels five days a week to every address in the UK. So it cannot pick and choose which business it wants to do. “Royal Mail must meet their universal service obligation while trying to compete with private firms who often cherry-pick the most profitable business,” says Ms King. Mr Kretinsky says he has a plan. His success in the energy sector allowed him to buy a 27. 5% stake in Royal Mail’s parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS). And his company – EP Group – intends to build a pan-European conglomerate built on three pillars: energy, retail and logistics. He sees IDS as the cornerstone of the logistics pillar, with a plan to go toe-to-toe with the likes of Deutsche Post DHL, DPD and Amazon. The USO has been under review by Ofcom, with Royal Mail hoping that the regulator will reduce the requirement to deliver second-class letters from six days a week to every other weekday. That single move could save Royal Mail £300m a year – putting it back on a break-even footing. Mr Kretinsky told me during our interview that he would honour the USO “as long as I am alive”, but he is unsurprisingly very much in favour of changing its terms. He said he hopes that “rational minds prevail” when reforming a service that is unsustainable in its current form. So far, the noises from Ofcom seem to be supportive. The regulator’s chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC there were “real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future”. Given letter numbers are falling, “we have to think about what is economical”, she said, adding Ofcom would be publishing plans for the regulation of Royal Mail “to make sure it is sustainable”. While Royal Mail generally welcomed the proposed changes to the Universal Service Obligation, Royal Mail pushed back against proposed new delivery time and business customer requirements. Royal Mail said last week that the level at which Ofcom is proposing to set the new delivery targets – 99. 5% of First Class letters delivered within three days, and the same percentage of Second Class letters within five – is “over specified and will add significant cost to the delivery of the Universal Service”. It also expressed concerns that proposals to add a new category of regulation to ensure timely delivery for business users like direct mail companies “goes against the wider government drive to reduce unnecessary regulation”. But there are other factors that may have driven the sale. Some analysts have speculated that there is another jewel in the crown of IDS - and that Mr Kretinsky may really be after a different part of the business. Along with Royal Mail, IDS also owns a European parcels business called GLS which it acquired in 1999 – long before Royal Mail was split off from the Post Office and privatised. Last year GLS made a profit of £320m, compared to Royal Mail, which lost £348m as letter volumes continued to plunge and new competitors ate into its market share of the more profitable parcels business. “GLS has been a profitable growth business, which has seen investment whereas Royal Mail has been a perpetual underperformer, as the board of parent company IDS has invested where it thinks it will see the best returns,” says Mr Paterson. Mr Kretinsky rejects suggestions from some quarters that he wants to break up the group and has committed to keeping it together for at least five years. Even beyond that, he says the plan is to grow the company rather than shrink it, so a disposal of GLS would be “nonsensical”. In fact, Mr Kretinsky says he hopes to bring the European parcel know-how at GLS to bear on Royal Mail’s operations. What the unions are hoping, and Kretinsky is promising, is that Royal Mail will see greater investment and over time begin to look a bit more like GLS and its European counterparts such as Deutche Post DHL. Given all the challenges Royal Mail faces, there’s an obvious question - why would a billionaire want to chance his arm on turning round something that others couldn’t, while up against powerful competitors? Well, if you believe as Kretinsky does - and he is surely right - that getting parcels to people is a profitable and growing industry, then buying Royal Mail and GLS gives you a way to become a big European player in logistics quickly. Add to that a powerful and historic brand, a database with every single UK address and a frontline workforce that most of its customers are fond of and pleased to see when they walk down the path - then, despite the challenges, it begins to make sense. Mr Kretinsky is convinced future growth lies in out-of-home (OOH) delivery. The parcel lockers found in supermarket car parks and elsewhere, operated by the likes of Amazon, Evri and UPS, have grown quickly across Europe. Earlier this month it was reported that Sainsbury’s would be the first supermarket to partner with Royal Mail and install parcel lockers at supermarkets. Some are already operating at several stores including ones in Clapham, Kidderminster and Chislehurst. Royal Mail has also trialled a new postbox that can take small parcels. Customers procure a barcode from an app, then at the postbox they scan the barcode and drop the parcel into a drawer - this is all powered by solar panels on the box. Emma Gilthorpe, Royal Mail chief executive, called it an “historic change” to give postboxes “a new lease of life”. All of this boils down to the same thing: convenience. It means customers don’t have to wait at home for a delivery - the sender or parcel business emails or texts a code to unlock the locker. For the business it’s more efficient, allowing couriers to deliver lots of parcels to one place - meaning fewer miles on the road and less time. “If they can grow the parcels business and claw back market share, there is every chance that they can add new jobs that could offset the reduction in jobs in the declining letters business,” says Mr Paterson. “There is a significant long-term opportunity to run Royal Mail more successfully with regulatory changes to the USO and greater investment in technology and out-of-home deliveries. ” But Royal Mail still has a lot of catching up to do with its competitors. It currently has 1,500 lockers in the UK and aims to grow this figure to at least 20,000 over time. By contrast, Amazon already has 5,000 lockers across the UK and InPost has 7,500 across the UK. That Mr Kretinsky has pulled off the takeover is no easy feat. Royal Mail is, after all, considered vital national infrastructure and as such the deal required review under national security laws. Then there is the fact that his companies own a gas pipeline that has transported Russian gas to Europe – paid for and approved by EU member states. The small amount that was transported was reduced to zero at the end of 2024 when Ukraine refused to renew permission for any gas to flow across its borders. Speaking in front of MPs in November, UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds referred to Mr Kretinsky as a “legitimate business figure” whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company two years ago. Getting the unions on board seemed even more of a challenge and the Communication Workers Union was wary of Mr Kretinsky. “The CWU believes Royal Mail should be in public hands,” Dave Ward, the CWU’s general secretary, told the BBC in June. “We know there are legitimate concerns about Royal Mail Group being owned by a foreign private equity investor. ” But during negotiations, union representatives secured a series of time-limited commitments from him, including guarantees that he will protect Royal Mail’s pension surplus, that there will be no compulsory redundancies for two years, no sell-off or break-up of any operational part of the existing company and no outsourcing of grades represented by the CWU. Mr Kretinsky also agreed to restrictions on moving dividends out of Royal Mail Group and to respect agreements with and recognition of the CWU. He said he would keep the brand name and Royal Mail’s headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years. Union bosses told me that a life under Mr Kretinsky “couldn’t be any worse than what we have had for the last 10 years”. So, as Mr Kretinsky looks certain to pull off the sale, what will customers notice? The frequency of second-class deliveries may be reduced after the Ofcom review. We will see new Royal Mail lockers appearing in our neighbourhoods. And the price of first-class mail may go up: second-class stamps are regulated by Ofcom, while first-class ones are not. The monarch’s head will still be on those stamps, but there is a new king of our mail system. And his name is Daniel Kretinsky.

    "title": "Update: 'I didn't know I was pregnant until I gave birth'",
    "body": "2025/04/12 - According to new developments, A woman who did not realise she was pregnant has described giving birth alone at the beauty parlour where she worked before cutting her baby’s umbilical cord with eyebrow scissors. Bryony Mills-Evans said she did not think she wanted children, but was thrust into motherhood at the age of 23 despite having no pregnancy symptoms. Cryptic pregnancies, where a woman is unaware they are pregnant until late on, or as in Bryony’s case, when in labour, have been described as “rare, but not exceptionally rare” by one midwifery professor. After recently discovering little was known about such pregnancies, Bryony has decided to raise awareness so others who have experienced something similar know they are not alone. A study has suggested there are about 325 of these surprise births in the UK every year. The beautician was at work in Newtown, Powys, on the day she gave birth, and after finishing with her last client felt what she thought were just menstrual cramps. “I had tight leggings on so I went on the beauty bed in the back to take them down because I thought that might ease the pain,” she said. “Within 10 minutes of lying there her head had come out. “I thought I’d just gone to the toilet, looked down and saw her head. ” Bryony instinctively started to push and gave birth to her 6lb 14 oz (3. 1kg) baby girl, Willow. “I didn’t really know what to do. My phone had died and was in another room, so I just lay on the bed for a bit,” she said. “After a while I noticed her umbilical cord had started going white. I had eyebrow scissors next to me, not that I know anything about babies, but I cut that with them and wrapped her up in loads of towels. ” Bryony, who has since had a second baby, then dashed to charge her phone before heading to the toilet. “I didn’t know that your placenta has to come out. I think maybe I freaked more with that because I thought it was another baby,” she recalled. After calling 999 Bryony was sent to hospital. While being asked questions by paramedics en route, she said she texted her mum something along the lines of “I’ve just had a baby, not to worry, we’re both fine,” before asking if she could meet her there. “I don’t think I held her until the next morning,” she said. “I was definitely freaked out because I was only 23 and didn’t think I ever wanted any kids. ” Bryony said it was only when her mum suggested she named her new baby that she began to calm down a bit. “It was a shock. Everyone always says to me ‘you must have been petrified’. “I don’t really remember being petrified, it’s just one of those moments where you just get on with it because you don’t really have another choice. ” Bryony said she had none of the tell-tale symptoms you would expect if you were pregnant - including a baby bump. “When people ask ‘how could you not know?’ I always say ‘if you have a period monthly…why are you checking that you’re pregnant?’ “ she said. While pregnant Bryony went to Alton Towers theme park where she went on every ride, attended music festivals and went on a trip to Poland, which she now believes was on her due date. Remarkably, she said she was told that her daughter Willow could have been around two weeks overdue due to her “wrinkly old man” appearance. “I had a bad back but I always have one because I’m 5’11 and slouch in my job every day, so it was no more than normal,” she said. According to Helen Cheyne, professor of maternal and infant health research at the University of Stirling, “it is not known” how a cryptic pregnancy like Bryony’s can happen. She said: “It’s actually one of these rather ill-understood phenomena [and] I think it’s very difficult for people to understand - how could a woman not know that they were pregnant? “We kind of have this intuitive notion that ‘of course a woman will know she’s pregnant as soon as she is’ but historically, that wouldn’t have been the case. ” Prof Cheyne explained before modern methods of testing for pregnancy, women relied on more subtle signs that indicated they were expecting like feeling the baby move, which typically doesn’t happen for first-time mothers until about 20 weeks. She said there was no medical definition of a cryptic pregnancy and that there is also an absence of data collected on them. “[They are] rare, but not exceptionally rare,” she said. “Most of my midwife colleagues had either come across it, or had heard of it, around their clinical practice. ” While working as a midwife in the early 1980s, Prof Cheyne met a woman in her mid-40s with other children who claimed to have had a cryptic pregnancy. She said the woman assumed she was entering the menopause, which was why she felt she was putting on weight and had stopped having periods. Prof Cheyne said as few pregnancies were cryptic, it is not something women needed to be concerned about. Bryony had been separated from Willow’s father, Robert Evans, for several months when she was born. As he was away for the weekend when she gave birth, the new mum broke the news to him a few days after their daughter’s unexpected arrival. “He was so excited - he rang me straight away and came to see her literally the next morning,” she said. “We sat in the house all day and just took it all in…it was definitely needed before I went out into the real world”. Six months after becoming parents, the pair rekindled their romance. Four years after Willow’s birth, the couple welcomed their second child, Parker Mills-Evans. Bryony said her second pregnancy felt completely different. “Everything I had with Parker, I didn’t have with [Willow]. ” Willow is now five and Bryony said she cannot imagine life without the baby she did not know she was having. “I decided to recently share my story as I’ve realised there is such a lack of support and knowledge around cryptic pregnancies,” she said. “I want the other women that this has happened to, to know that they’re not alone - there are others out there. ” "

    "title": "Update: What goes on inside toddlers' brains?",
    "body": "2025/04/10 - Here’s what you need to know: Two-year-old Henry is completely transfixed by the iPad in front of him. Every time a smiley face appears he taps the screen - and his tap transforms the face into a cartoon of a dancing animal. It looks like a simple, repetitive game, but is actually a test of a fundamental skill that is developing in the toddler’s growing brain. Henry is wearing a sensor-laden cap with wires emerging from it that are attached to a large piece of analytical machinery. While Henry plays the game, the cap is scanning his brain activity and building up a picture of how well he can control his decision making. It is a test of inhibitory control, one of the skills scientists at the University of Bristol are measuring in babies and toddlers, as part of a mission to understand how and when very young children develop abilities that enable them to focus and learn. Scientists already know these skills are critical - but they don’t yet know at what point they are established in an infant brain. The development of hundreds of children - from the age of six months to five years - is being tracked as they form the key skills that will shape their academic and social abilities. But what is really special about this pioneering project is that it is a human experiment within another decades-long human experiment. The mothers of 300 of the children being studied are themselves part of a project that has monitored their health since they too were babies, in the 1990s. A lifetime of data is being gathered that could reveal links between the brain development of the children being studied now and the health, experiences and genetics of their parents. For a study of child development, already having all this rich information about the parents is “completely unique in the world”, lead researcher Dr Karla Holmboe says. “We need to know when different skills develop and we need to understand how individual children develop over time. ” Children who are struggling when they start school tend to continue to struggle, Dr Holmboe explains. “That can even continue into adulthood. So, there’s this whole period of development that we need to understand so we can support children at a much younger age. ” During the study, young participants and their parents are invited to the university psychology lab to play scientific games and have their brain activity measured. Many have MRI scans at the ages of six months, three years and five years, generating a true picture of their young, developing brains. Key to the smiley face game Henry is playing is where that face appears on the iPad screen. Just as the toddler gets used to the face repeatedly popping up on the right side of his screen, it randomly starts appearing on the other side too. “We’re seeing if Henry can resist the urge to just keep tapping on the right,” explains research assistant Carmel Brough, “and instead look for where the smiley face is. ” This skill, explains Dr Holmboe, is critical when children start school. “In a classroom, a child needs to be able to focus and not let their attention drift,” she says. “To learn new things, we need to be able to stop old habits. ” In another room, Jaxon, who is also aged two, is playing a game designed to test his working memory. A research assistant encourages him to watch as she puts stickers in different pots. The toddler is then asked to recall which pots contain stickers, and which do not. The motivating factor? Jaxon can keep all the stickers he finds. “Working memory is when we need to keep a little bit of information in our head to solve a problem or do a task - like a puzzle, or even just remembering where we put something two minutes ago,” explains Dr Holmboe. “For children, you can imagine we need these skills when we learn maths or learn to read. “These are what I call ‘building blocks’ of really important skills. ” The study will also assess language development and processing speed - a measure of how quickly children pick up new information. The Children of the 90s project is now 35 years old. Focused primarily on health, by tracking 14,500 children born between 1991 and 1992, it has revealed insights into obesity, autism and, more recently, the effect of the pandemic on mental health. The project’s data has been made available to scientists around the world and has been cited in thousands of scientific papers. One study of the diets of children of the 90s provided evidence that, while a child’s fussy eating is often worrying, it is unlikely to have any lasting impact on their health and development. Thanks to repeated health-screenings that have been key to the project, it also revealed that one in five young people shows signs of fatty liver disease, and one in 40 young people may have liver scarring - caused largely by obesity and alcohol consumption. This has shown just how common the condition is and provided insights into ways it can be prevented through diet. And the scientific revelations keep on coming. Last month, the study revealed that children who lacked oily fish in their diets were less sociable and kind. In this latest study – of the children of the children of the 90s – scientists are looking specifically at formative abilities and brain development. They will follow each child until they start school. Emily, who was studied as a child of the 90s, is Henry’s mum. Today, her young son sits on her lap as he works on one of the research team’s carefully designed puzzles. “We’ve both been a part of this since birth,” Emily says. “It wasn’t a choice for me at the start - my mum signed me up. But it is now, and I just think it’s fascinating. ” Helping children to thrive in the future is the aim, Dr Holmboe says. Because when children start school, she explains “a lot of things are already set. “This is the groundwork that will help us support children at the right time. ” Henry and Jaxon finish their puzzles and games and take off their brain-scanning hats. “My boys just love coming here,” says Emily. “They love all the toys - they get free snacks. So I’ll continue coming just as long as they want to. “Why wouldn’t you want to be part of this and maybe help future generations?” Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

Every time a smiley face appears he taps the screen - and his tap transforms the face into a cartoon of a dancing animal. It looks like a simple, repetitive game, but is actually a test of a fundamental skill that is developing in the toddler’s growing brain. Henry is wearing a sensor-laden cap with wires emerging from it that are attached to a large piece of analytical machinery. While Henry plays the game, the cap is scanning his brain activity and building up a picture of how well he can control his decision making. It is a test of inhibitory control, one of the skills scientists at the University of Bristol are measuring in babies and toddlers, as part of a mission to understand how and when very young children develop abilities that enable them to focus and learn. Scientists already know these skills are critical - but they don’t yet know at what point they are established in an infant brain. The development of hundreds of children - from the age of six months to five years - is being tracked as they form the key skills that will shape their academic and social abilities. But what is really special about this pioneering project is that it is a human experiment within another decades-long human experiment. The mothers of 300 of the children being studied are themselves part of a project that has monitored their health since they too were babies, in the 1990s. A lifetime of data is being gathered that could reveal links between the brain development of the children being studied now and the health, experiences and genetics of their parents. For a study of child development, already having all this rich information about the parents is “completely unique in the world”, lead researcher Dr Karla Holmboe says. “We need to know when different skills develop and we need to understand how individual children develop over time. ” Children who are struggling when they start school tend to continue to struggle, Dr Holmboe explains. “That can even continue into adulthood. So, there’s this whole period of development that we need to understand so we can support children at a much younger age. ” During the study, young participants and their parents are invited to the university psychology lab to play scientific games and have their brain activity measured. Many have MRI scans at the ages of six months, three years and five years, generating a true picture of their young, developing brains. Key to the smiley face game Henry is playing is where that face appears on the iPad screen. Just as the toddler gets used to the face repeatedly popping up on the right side of his screen, it randomly starts appearing on the other side too. “We’re seeing if Henry can resist the urge to just keep tapping on the right,” explains research assistant Carmel Brough, “and instead look for where the smiley face is. ” This skill, explains Dr Holmboe, is critical when children start school. “In a classroom, a child needs to be able to focus and not let their attention drift,” she says. “To learn new things, we need to be able to stop old habits. ” In another room, Jaxon, who is also aged two, is playing a game designed to test his working memory. A research assistant encourages him to watch as she puts stickers in different pots. The toddler is then asked to recall which pots contain stickers, and which do not. The motivating factor? Jaxon can keep all the stickers he finds. “Working memory is when we need to keep a little bit of information in our head to solve a problem or do a task - like a puzzle, or even just remembering where we put something two minutes ago,” explains Dr Holmboe. “For children, you can imagine we need these skills when we learn maths or learn to read. “These are what I call ‘building blocks’ of really important skills. ” The study will also assess language development and processing speed - a measure of how quickly children pick up new information. The Children of the 90s project is now 35 years old. Focused primarily on health, by tracking 14,500 children born between 1991 and 1992, it has revealed insights into obesity, autism and, more recently, the effect of the pandemic on mental health. The project’s data has been made available to scientists around the world and has been cited in thousands of scientific papers. One study of the diets of children of the 90s provided evidence that, while a child’s fussy eating is often worrying, it is unlikely to have any lasting impact on their health and development. Thanks to repeated health-screenings that have been key to the project, it also revealed that one in five young people shows signs of fatty liver disease, and one in 40 young people may have liver scarring - caused largely by obesity and alcohol consumption. This has shown just how common the condition is and provided insights into ways it can be prevented through diet. And the scientific revelations keep on coming. Last month, the study revealed that children who lacked oily fish in their diets were less sociable and kind. In this latest study – of the children of the children of the 90s – scientists are looking specifically at formative abilities and brain development. They will follow each child until they start school. Emily, who was studied as a child of the 90s, is Henry’s mum. Today, her young son sits on her lap as he works on one of the research team’s carefully designed puzzles. “We’ve both been a part of this since birth,” Emily says. “It wasn’t a choice for me at the start - my mum signed me up. But it is now, and I just think it’s fascinating. ” Helping children to thrive in the future is the aim, Dr Holmboe says. Because when children start school, she explains “a lot of things are already set. “This is the groundwork that will help us support children at the right time. ” Henry and Jaxon finish their puzzles and games and take off their brain-scanning hats. “My boys just love coming here,” says Emily. “They love all the toys - they get free snacks. So I’ll continue coming just as long as they want to. “Why wouldn’t you want to be part of this and maybe help future generations?” Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "title": "Update: Do we need cocoa-free chocolate and is it nice?",
    "body": "2025/04/10 - According to new developments, The first thing I notice is the lack of a strong aroma. There’s no familiar, powerful waft of cocoa when opening this bag of sweets, the packet of biscuits, or the caramel-filled truffles. And as I taste each one as part of my solemn commitment to inform the public, I don’t get quite the same burst of chocolate flavour that you might expect from treats with that familiar, waxy, light brown chocolate-like coating. The thing is, this isn’t chocolate. It’s made with sunflower seeds. Or fava (also called broad) beans. The selection before me is just a smattering of the non-cocoa containing alternatives to chocolate that are creeping into the European retail market right now. Their makers have spied an opportunity, partly because real chocolate prices are soaring. “The average increase in price for chocolate was 9% over 2024,” says Richard Caines, principal analyst in UK food and drink research at market research firm Mintel. “In January just gone, it’s shot up by 14%. ” That’s the retail price of chocolate. The wholesale price of the key ingredient, cocoa – which is made from fermented, roasted and ground cacao beans – has increased by an astonishing 300% in 2024. “I have been looking at this chocolate market for quite a few years now – I don’t remember a big story like this on costs going up,” adds Mr Caines. A key reason for this increase is climate change-related weather impacts on cacao farms, particularly in West Africa. Plus, some farmers in Ghana are turning away from cacao production in favour of illegal gold-mining, according to reports. It means that there was a deficit of roughly 500,000 tonnes of cocoa in the global market last year. Real chocolate could become a “luxury” item in the future says Massimo Sabatini, co-founder and chief executive of Italian firm Foreverland, which makes a cocoa powder alternative called Choruba. The company opened its production facility in March, where staff process not cacao beans but carob husks. Carob trees produce small, brown, banana-shaped pods containing seeds. It’s possible to process the pods to create a cocoa-like powder. This chocolate alternative has a long history, however – and not a very happy one. A New Yorker article claims a generation was “traumatized” by carob-based confectionary during the 1970s. It didn’t taste as good as real chocolate, and it didn’t melt in your mouth in the same way, apparently. But Mr Sabatini insists that he and his colleagues have come up with a worthy product. He acknowledges that carob “really doesn’t taste like chocolate” but adds that Foreverland’s fermentation and roasting process removes some of the carob flavour to get it closer to cocoa. Their carob-based dark chocolate alternative is sweeter and more caramel-like than real dark chocolate, he explains. There could be health benefits to this. “We can reduce drastically the sugar content,” says Mr Sabatini. Carob is also higher in fibre and lower in fat than cocoa. German food manufacturer Planet A Foods has developed a different chocolate alternative. Sara Marquart, co-founder and chief technology officer, says her goal is not to replace chocolate but to help fill the gap in the market caused by volatility in cocoa availability and prices. Unlike Foreverland, Planet A Foods have chosen sunflower seeds as the key ingredient in their cocoa powder alternative, ChoViva. “We process sunflower seeds like cocoa beans,” explains Dr Marquart. “It’s a highly abundant ingredient, there’s millions and millions of tonnes on the market. ” ChoViva is now present in roughly 35 different retail products, mostly on the market in Germany and France – though it also appears in mini egg-shaped sweets sold by Aldi in the UK. The sweets are made with peanuts and have a chocolate-like coating containing ChoViva. When I try them, the flavour is overwhelmingly dominated by the salty peanut at the egg’s core. But the chocolatey texture of the coating is impressive. The same applies to ChoViva-covered biscuits made by the firm. I note that the chocolate-like coating is rather thin and not overly flavourful. But again, the texture is pretty much what you’d expect from real chocolate, though not quite as melty. The company’s ChoViva-covered popcorn is probably the most chocolatey item I try – the popcorn doesn’t usurp its coating. Overall, there’s nothing here that would perturb a consumer. Especially one unaware that these products don’t actually contain chocolate. A UK start-up also keen to compete in this space is Nukoko. Two of its founders previously ran a real chocolate business and teamed up with a food scientist to form their new venture. “We saw first-hand the issues with the chocolate supply chain,” says Ross Newton, co-founder. Like Foreverland and Planet A Foods, Nukoko has opted for a key ingredient that the firm can source and process locally – to reduce food miles and insulate against supply chain risks. But in Nukoko’s case the raw material of choice is not carob or sunflower seeds but fava beans. “There’s around a million tonnes harvested in the UK every year,” says Mr Newton. It’s early days for the company but he adds that he hopes to begin selling their cocoa powder alternative to food firms later this year. Mr Newton says imitating the flavour of real chocolate is very hard but that, out of 25 crucial flavour compounds in real chocolate, his company’s product manages to include 24 of them – though in some cases at slightly different concentrations. The company sends me four caramel-filled truffles to try. The caramel totally dominates and the truffles are very sweet. But the chocolate alternative is as smooth and glossy as you’d expect, and very satisfying to chew. “Anything new that comes out has got to meet equal taste expectations,” says Mr Caines, noting how discerning consumers are when it comes to their favourite chocolate-containing products. Getting them to embrace alternatives devoid of cocoa will be no mean feat. He adds that alternatives might fare best when used in bakery products – such as the chips in chocolate chip cookies: “The chocolate is not so much the star of the show there so it might actually be more acceptable. ” Should chocolate alternatives meet with success, there is some risk that this could negatively impact cacao farmers, says Tonya Lander, a lecturer in biology at Oxford University. “It’s something that should be worked through with farmers or farmer collectives,” she says. Cacao farmers are among the poorest agricultural workers in the world. Nukoko, Planet A Foods and Foreverland all say they don’t aim to replace chocolate, rather, the goal is to fill the gap left by cocoa production shortfalls. Dr Lander and colleagues have studied environmental factors that influence yield from cacao trees. Poor pollination and high temperatures negatively affect how much cacao the trees produce, the researchers report in a study published in February. By shading cacao trees on plantations, for example, it might be possible to improve harvests and potentially reduce the volatility of cocoa supplies. Such interventions, besides switching to cocoa alternatives, could help satisfy confectionary-obsessed consumers in the coming years. "

    "body": "2025/04/09 - Here’s what you need to know: It sounds like something from a science fiction movie, but Stephen Eisele is confident that one day his company will open a data centre on the Moon. “The way we see it is that by putting the data centre in space, you’re really offering unparalleled security,” says the president of Lonestar Data Holdings. Last month, the Florida-based firm claimed to have successfully tested a tiny data centre the size of a hardback book that hitched a ride to the Moon on the Athena Lunar Lander from US space exploration firm Intuitive Machines. This, in turn, had been launched by a rocket from Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Data centres are the vast warehouses that house stacks of computers that store and process data used by websites, companies and governments. Lonestar says that putting them on the Moon will offer customers secure, reliable data processing, while taking advantage of unlimited solar energy to power them. And while space-based data centres may sound far-fetched, it’s an idea that’s really starting to take off. Part of the reason is rocketing demand and the difficulty of finding suitable sites on Earth. The ever-expanding use of artificial intelligence (AI) computing has seen a massive increase in the amount of data that needs to be stored and processed around the world. As a result, the need for data centres has shot up too, with annual demand set to rise between 19% and 22% by 2030, according to global management consultants McKinsey. New facilities are springing up all the time - but it’s getting hard to find places to put them. Data centres are large and sprawling, and use enormous amounts of power and water for cooling. And increasingly local people don’t want them built nearby. Putting data centres in space – either in orbit around Earth, or on the Moon - the theory goes, means they can’t do quite so much harm. There’s more-or-less unlimited energy available from the sun, for example, and no neighbours to complain about the environmental impacts. Not only that, space-based data centres could specialise in services for spacecraft and other space facilities, with space-to-space data transfers quicker than from the ground. Last summer, a European Commission-funded feasibility study into orbiting data centres published its results. The Ascend report by carried out by Thales Alenia Space - a joint venture between French and Italian aerospace groups Thales and Leonardo - published its results. It determined that deploying data centres in space “could transform the European digital landscape”, and be “more eco-friendly”. Thales Alenia Space envisages building a constellation of 13 satellites measuring a combined 200m-by-80m, and with a total data processing power of around 10 megawatts (MW). That’s equivalent to a current medium-sized, ground-based data centre, with some 5,000 servers. Based on technologies that already exist or are under development, the satellites would be assembled in orbit. Damien Dumestier, Ascend project architect at Thales Alenia Space, says that for space-based data centres to be more environmentally friendly than existing ground-based ones it will be necessary to make the rocket launchers 10 times less emissive over their lifecycles. He says this looks possible. “But in order to cover the new technology’s developments and the production capacity ramp-up to benefit from scale, we have to consider larger system capacity, around 200MW, meaning 200 of our envisaged large space infrastructures and 200 launches,” he says. “The main question is when an adapted launcher will be ready. Depending on the investment and decisions to be taken, this could be done for 2030 or 2035, meaning commercial viability before 2037. ” However, despite this optimism from firms aiming to develop the technology, Dr Domenico Vicinanza, associate professor of intelligent systems and data science at Anglia Ruskin University in the UK, says there are numerous big hurdles before space-based data centres can be a viable proposition. “Even with the contribution and advancements of companies like SpaceX, launching hardware into orbit remains extremely expensive,” he says. “Each kilogram sent into space costs thousands of dollars. “Space-based data centres would require not only the data equipment but also the infrastructure to protect, power, and cool them. All of which add up in weight and complexity. ” Cooling the equipment will be a particular problem, because even though space is cold, conventional cooling systems don’t work well without gravity. Meanwhile, space weather can damage electronics, while the ever-increasing quantity of space debris puts the physical hardware at risk. Dr Vicinanza adds: “And fixing problems in orbit is far from straightforward. Even with robotics and automation, there are limits to what can be repaired remotely. “A big hardware failure might necessitate a costly human mission, potentially making downtime stretch for weeks or months. ” Yet firms like Lonestar are supremely confident, and say that they are responding to demand. “We wouldn’t be doing this if the customers weren’t asking us to,” says Mr Scott. Its next target is to put a small data centre in orbit around the moon in 2027. Meanwhile, other companies are hoping to get there a bit faster, such as Washington state-based Starcloud, which is due to launch a satellite-based data centre next month, and start commercial operations in mid-2026. Lonestar’s Mr Eidele says that space-based facilities offer more security for governments and businesses because their data does not need to be routed through terrestrial networks. Instead the information can be beamed directly from space to a dedicated ground station. “It’s like having the vaults at the back of the bank,” he says. “You don’t have to open it every day, but it’s there to provide an extra measure of security, and the distance from the Earth to the moon offers that - it’s that much harder to hack, that much harder to access. ” The distance to the Moon means that data takes about a second and a half to reach the ground - this doesn’t matter for some applications, like longer-term data storage and backups. And meanwhile, says Lonestar founder and chief executive Chris Stott, space-based data centres can help organisations meet regulations about data sovereignty - the need to hold peoples’ data in the country of origin. “Under space law, that box of electronics is literally under the law of the licensing or launching state - it is an actual embassy in space,” he says. Lonestar already has customers lined up, including the state of Florida and the Isle of Man government. "

    "title": "Latest: The Canadians and Danes boycotting American products",
    "body": "2025/04/08 - Let’s dive into the details: Todd Brayman is no longer buying his favourite red wine, which is from California. A veteran of the Canadian Armed Forces, he is one of a growing number of people in Canada, Europe, and other parts of the world, who are avoiding buying US products due to President Trump’s tariffs and treatment of US allies. “I have in my life served alongside American forces. It is just profoundly upsetting and disappointing to see where we are given the historical ties that our two countries have,” says Mr Brayman, who lives in Nova Scotia. “But I think right now it’s time to stand up and be counted, and in my mind, that means buying local and supporting Canadian business. ” Together with his wife, Mr Brayman has replaced all the American products he used to buy, including his previous wine of choice, with Canadian alternatives. “Luckett Phone Box Red wine, which is from right here in Nova Scotia, is great,” he says. Determining which products are Canadian isn’t always easy however. “Sometimes labelling can be misleading,” adds Mr Brayman. To help, he now uses an app on his phone that can scan a product’s barcode and identify where it’s from. If the product is identified as American, the app suggests Canadian alternatives. The app, called Maple Scan, is one of numerous emerging in Canada to help people shop local. Others include Buy Canadian, Is This Canadian? and Shop Canadian. Maple Scan’s founder, Sasha Ivanov, says his app has had 100,000 downloads since it launched last month. He believes the momentum around buying Canadian is here to stay. “Lots of Canadians have told me, ‘I’m not going back’. It’s important that we support local regardless,” he says. Canadians like Mr Brayman are boycotting American products in response to a raft of import tariffs introduced by Trump. These included tariffs of 25% on all foreign cars, steel and aluminium, and 25% tariffs on other Canadian and Mexican goods. Meanwhile, other European Union exports will get tariffs of 20%, while the UK is facing 10%. Trump says the tariffs will boost US manufacturing, raise tax revenue and reduce the US trade deficit. However, they have spooked global markets, which have fallen sharply over the past month. Trump has even expressed a desire for Canada to join the US as its 51st state, something the Canadian government was quick to strongly reject. Ottawa has also responded with C$60bn ($42bn; £32bn) in counter tariffs, as well as additional tariffs on the US auto sector. And there has been a substantial drop in the number of Canadians travelling to the US. Groups dedicated to boycotting US goods have also emerged in European countries. Momentum behind the boycott is particularly strong in Denmark, whose territory of Greenland Trump has said he wants to acquire. Denmark’s largest grocery store operator, Salling Group, recently introduced a symbol, a black star, on pricing labels to denote European brands. Bo Albertus, a school principal who lives in Skovlunde, a suburb of Copenhagen, says joining the boycott was his way of taking action. “Statements that Trump made about wanting to buy Greenland, that was just too much for me,” he says. “I can’t do anything about the American political system, but I can vote with my credit card. ” One of Mr Albertus’s first moves was to cancel his subscriptions to US streaming services, including Netflix, Disney Plus and Apple TV. “My 11-year-old daughter is a bit annoyed about it, but that’s the way it is. She understands why I do it,” he says. Mr Albertus is the administrator for a Danish Facebook group dedicated to helping people boycott US goods. In the group, which has 90,000 members, people share recommendations for local alternatives to US goods, from shoes to lawnmowers. Mr Albertus says: “It’s a movement that is quite a lot bigger than just our little country, so it all that adds up. ” Mette Heerulff Christiansen, the owner of a grocery shop in Copenhagen called Broders has stopped stocking American products, such as Cheetos crisps and Hershey’s chocolate, in her store. She is substituting them with Danish or European products where possible. Ms Christiansen is also swapping out products she uses at home. She’s finding some easier to replace than others. “Coca-Cola is easy to substitute with Jolly Cola, a Danish brand,” she says. “But technology, like Facebook, that’s totally difficult to avoid. ” She believes the boycott movement in Denmark is helping people to channel their anger at Trump’s policies and rhetoric. “I think it’s more for the Danish people to feel good that they are doing something,” she says. Douglas Irwin, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College in the US, who specializes in the history of US trade policy, believes the economic impact of the boycott may be limited. “It is hard to judge how economically significant the consumer boycotts will be in terms of reducing trade with the United States,” he says. “In the past, boycotts have not lasted long and have not achieved much. It starts as a hostile reaction to some US action but tends to fade with time,” he says. For now though, the rising Buy Canadian sentiment in Canada is boosting sales for many local brands. The CEO of Canadian grocer Loblaw posted on LinkedIn that weekly sales of Canadian products were up by double digits. Bianca Parsons, from Alberta in Canada, is behind an initiative to promote locally-made goods, called Made In Alberta, which she says has had a surge in interest since the tariffs were introduced. “We’re now getting over 20,000 hits [to the site] every two weeks. ” Ms Parsons, who is the executive director of the Alberta Food Processors Association, adds: “I’ve had producers reach out to us and say: ‘I’m selling out at stores that I would never sell out before, thank you so much’. ” Several Canadian provinces, including Ontario and Nova Scotia, have removed US-made alcoholic beverages from their liquor store shelves in response to tariffs, a move the boss of Jack Daniel’s maker Brown-Forman has said is “worse than tariffs”. Among the American businesses feeling the impact is Caledonia Spirits, a distiller based in Vermont, near the Canadian border.  Ryan Christiansen, Caledonia’s president and head distiller, says his business had an order on track for shipment to Quebec cancelled directly after tariffs were announced. “My sense is that everyone’s just being a little too aggressive and, unfortunately, I think America started that,” says Mr Christiansen. “I do understand that the action America took needed a counter reaction. “If it were up to me, I’d be at the table trying to resolve this in a friendly way, and I’m hopeful that the leaders in America take that approach. ” Ethan Frisch, the co-founder of Burlap &amp; Barrel, an American spice company based in New York, which also exports to Canada, says he’s more concerned with the impact of the tariffs on his company’s imports and rising inflation in the US than the consumer boycott. He says: “I think there’s this assumption that, if you boycott an American company, it’s going to have an impact on the economy and maybe change the situation. I think that assumption, unfortunately, is not accurate. “The [US] economy is crashing all up by itself. Businesses like ours are struggling without boycotts. ” "

    "title": "Big News: The Canadians and Danes boycotting American products",
    "body": "2025/04/08 - Let’s dive into the details: Todd Brayman is no longer buying his favourite red wine, which is from California. A veteran of the Canadian Armed Forces, he is one of a growing number of people in Canada, Europe, and other parts of the world, who are avoiding buying US products due to President Trump’s tariffs and treatment of US allies. “I have in my life served alongside American forces. It is just profoundly upsetting and disappointing to see where we are given the historical ties that our two countries have,” says Mr Brayman, who lives in Nova Scotia. “But I think right now it’s time to stand up and be counted, and in my mind, that means buying local and supporting Canadian business. ” Together with his wife, Mr Brayman has replaced all the American products he used to buy, including his previous wine of choice, with Canadian alternatives. “Luckett Phone Box Red wine, which is from right here in Nova Scotia, is great,” he says. Determining which products are Canadian isn’t always easy however. “Sometimes labelling can be misleading,” adds Mr Brayman. To help, he now uses an app on his phone that can scan a product’s barcode and identify where it’s from. If the product is identified as American, the app suggests Canadian alternatives. The app, called Maple Scan, is one of numerous emerging in Canada to help people shop local. Others include Buy Canadian, Is This Canadian? and Shop Canadian. Maple Scan’s founder, Sasha Ivanov, says his app has had 100,000 downloads since it launched last month. He believes the momentum around buying Canadian is here to stay. “Lots of Canadians have told me, ‘I’m not going back’. It’s important that we support local regardless,” he says. Canadians like Mr Brayman are boycotting American products in response to a raft of import tariffs introduced by Trump. These included tariffs of 25% on all foreign cars, steel and aluminium, and 25% tariffs on other Canadian and Mexican goods. Meanwhile, other European Union exports will get tariffs of 20%, while the UK is facing 10%. Trump says the tariffs will boost US manufacturing, raise tax revenue and reduce the US trade deficit. However, they have spooked global markets, which have fallen sharply over the past month. Trump has even expressed a desire for Canada to join the US as its 51st state, something the Canadian government was quick to strongly reject. Ottawa has also responded with C$60bn ($42bn; £32bn) in counter tariffs, as well as additional tariffs on the US auto sector. And there has been a substantial drop in the number of Canadians travelling to the US. Groups dedicated to boycotting US goods have also emerged in European countries. Momentum behind the boycott is particularly strong in Denmark, whose territory of Greenland Trump has said he wants to acquire. Denmark’s largest grocery store operator, Salling Group, recently introduced a symbol, a black star, on pricing labels to denote European brands. Bo Albertus, a school principal who lives in Skovlunde, a suburb of Copenhagen, says joining the boycott was his way of taking action. “Statements that Trump made about wanting to buy Greenland, that was just too much for me,” he says. “I can’t do anything about the American political system, but I can vote with my credit card. ” One of Mr Albertus’s first moves was to cancel his subscriptions to US streaming services, including Netflix, Disney Plus and Apple TV. “My 11-year-old daughter is a bit annoyed about it, but that’s the way it is. She understands why I do it,” he says. Mr Albertus is the administrator for a Danish Facebook group dedicated to helping people boycott US goods. In the group, which has 90,000 members, people share recommendations for local alternatives to US goods, from shoes to lawnmowers. Mr Albertus says: “It’s a movement that is quite a lot bigger than just our little country, so it all that adds up. ” Mette Heerulff Christiansen, the owner of a grocery shop in Copenhagen called Broders has stopped stocking American products, such as Cheetos crisps and Hershey’s chocolate, in her store. She is substituting them with Danish or European products where possible. Ms Christiansen is also swapping out products she uses at home. She’s finding some easier to replace than others. “Coca-Cola is easy to substitute with Jolly Cola, a Danish brand,” she says. “But technology, like Facebook, that’s totally difficult to avoid. ” She believes the boycott movement in Denmark is helping people to channel their anger at Trump’s policies and rhetoric. “I think it’s more for the Danish people to feel good that they are doing something,” she says. Douglas Irwin, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College in the US, who specializes in the history of US trade policy, believes the economic impact of the boycott may be limited. “It is hard to judge how economically significant the consumer boycotts will be in terms of reducing trade with the United States,” he says. “In the past, boycotts have not lasted long and have not achieved much. It starts as a hostile reaction to some US action but tends to fade with time,” he says. For now though, the rising Buy Canadian sentiment in Canada is boosting sales for many local brands. The CEO of Canadian grocer Loblaw posted on LinkedIn that weekly sales of Canadian products were up by double digits. Bianca Parsons, from Alberta in Canada, is behind an initiative to promote locally-made goods, called Made In Alberta, which she says has had a surge in interest since the tariffs were introduced. “We’re now getting over 20,000 hits [to the site] every two weeks. ” Ms Parsons, who is the executive director of the Alberta Food Processors Association, adds: “I’ve had producers reach out to us and say: ‘I’m selling out at stores that I would never sell out before, thank you so much’. ” Several Canadian provinces, including Ontario and Nova Scotia, have removed US-made alcoholic beverages from their liquor store shelves in response to tariffs, a move the boss of Jack Daniel’s maker Brown-Forman has said is “worse than tariffs”. Among the American businesses feeling the impact is Caledonia Spirits, a distiller based in Vermont, near the Canadian border.  Ryan Christiansen, Caledonia’s president and head distiller, says his business had an order on track for shipment to Quebec cancelled directly after tariffs were announced. “My sense is that everyone’s just being a little too aggressive and, unfortunately, I think America started that,” says Mr Christiansen. “I do understand that the action America took needed a counter reaction. “If it were up to me, I’d be at the table trying to resolve this in a friendly way, and I’m hopeful that the leaders in America take that approach. ” Ethan Frisch, the co-founder of Burlap &amp; Barrel, an American spice company based in New York, which also exports to Canada, says he’s more concerned with the impact of the tariffs on his company’s imports and rising inflation in the US than the consumer boycott. He says: “I think there’s this assumption that, if you boycott an American company, it’s going to have an impact on the economy and maybe change the situation. I think that assumption, unfortunately, is not accurate. “The [US] economy is crashing all up by itself. Businesses like ours are struggling without boycotts. ” "

    "body": "2025/04/08 - According to new developments, It’s likely that you have not heard of Taiwan’s Hong Fu Industrial Group, but look down on a busy street and you may well see its products. Hong Fu is the world’s second-biggest maker of trainers (sneakers) supplying shoes to Nike, Converse, Adidas, Puma and many others. It makes around 200 million pairs of sports shoes a year. So when it made a big investment in India’s market, the footwear industry took note. Hong Fu is currently building a giant plant in Panapakkam, in the state of Tamil Nadu in south eastern India. When fully operational, some time in the next three to five years, it will make 25 million pairs of shoes a year, employing as many as 25,000 workers. The project has Indian partners, including Aqeel Panaruna, the chairman of Florence Shoe Company: “The international market is saturated and they [Hong Fu] were looking for a new market,” he explains. “There is a drastic increase in non-leather footwear in India. It has huge potential,” Mr Panaruna added. The Indian government is keen to attract such investment, hoping it will raise standards in the footwear industry and boost exports. To spur the industry, last August the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) introduced new quality rules for all shoes sold in India. Under those standards, for example, materials will have to pass tests of strength and flexibility. “These BIS standards are really about cleaning up the market. We’ve had too many low-quality products flooding in, and consumers deserve better,” says Sandeep Sharma a journalist and footwear industry expert. But many in India can’t afford shoes from well-known brands. Serving them is a huge and intricate network of small shoe makers, known as the unorganised sector. Their affordable products are estimated to account for two-thirds of the total footwear market. Ashok (he withheld his full name) counts himself as part of that sector, with shoe making units all across the district of Agra in northern India. He estimates that 200,0000 pairs of shoes are made everyday by operations like his across Agra. “Many consumers, especially in rural and lower-income urban areas, opt for cheaper local footwear instead of branded options,” he says. “Many organised brands struggle to expand their retail footprint in semi-urban and rural areas because we cater to them. ” So how will the new government standards affect makers like Ashok? “It’s complicated,” says Mr Sharma. “I think the government is trying to walk a tightrope here. They can’t just shut down thousands of small businesses that employ millions of people - that would be economic suicide. “What I’m seeing is more of a carrot-and-stick approach. They’re pushing for standards, but also rolling out programs to help small manufacturers upgrade their processes. It’s not about wiping out the unorganised sector but gradually bringing them into the fold. ” Making the situation more complicated is that the unorganised sector is well-known for making counterfeit shoes of big brands. While popular among Indian shoppers looking for a stylish bargain, other countries have long-complained about the losses caused. Meanwhile, a host of new Indian trainer-makers are springing up, to serve India’s growing middle class. Sabhib Agrawal is trying to get those buyers interested in barefoot footwear - shoes which, their makers say, are healthy for the foot as they encourage natural, or barefoot, movement. Mr Agrawal says his company, Zen Barefoot, is unusual as much of the Indian footwear industry is not very innovative. “There are very few people who are ready to take time and invest in new technologies here. Indian manufacturing is a very profit- first market, ROI [return on investment] driven. “And in a lot of cases, even the government is not ready to enable these industries through grants or tax relief, which makes it quite difficult. ” Comet is one Indian firm looking to innovate. It claims to be the first homegrown trainer brand that owns the whole production process, from design to manufacturing. “This level of control allows us to experiment with materials, introduce innovative silhouettes, and continuously refine comfort and fit based on real feedback,” says founder Utkarsh Gupta. He says the Comet shoes are adapted to India’s climate and roads. “Most homegrown brands rely on off-the-shelf soles from the market, but when we started Comet, we realized that these were lacking in quality, durability, and grip,” he says. Change is coming to the footwear sector he says. “The shift to high value is now happening. ” “Many high value brands need to move their manufacturing to India. In 3-5 years, we should have a robust ecosystem to compete in the international sneaker market,” he adds. Back in Agra, Ashok hopes that the unorganised sector is not neglected amid the growth of India’s footwear industry. “The government should give us accreditation and certificates so our factories don’t close down. Once we too are included in the organised sector no one can beat India in the shoe manufacturing industry. ” But Mr Sharma says change is inevitable. “The market is definitely going to shift. We’ll see the bigger players getting bigger - they have the money to adapt quickly. “But I don’t think the small guys will disappear completely. The smart ones will find their niche. ” "

They can’t just shut down thousands of small businesses that employ millions of people - that would be economic suicide. “What I’m seeing is more of a carrot-and-stick approach. They’re pushing for standards, but also rolling out programs to help small manufacturers upgrade their processes. It’s not about wiping out the unorganised sector but gradually bringing them into the fold. ” Making the situation more complicated is that the unorganised sector is well-known for making counterfeit shoes of big brands. While popular among Indian shoppers looking for a stylish bargain, other countries have long-complained about the losses caused. Meanwhile, a host of new Indian trainer-makers are springing up, to serve India’s growing middle class. Sabhib Agrawal is trying to get those buyers interested in barefoot footwear - shoes which, their makers say, are healthy for the foot as they encourage natural, or barefoot, movement. Mr Agrawal says his company, Zen Barefoot, is unusual as much of the Indian footwear industry is not very innovative. “There are very few people who are ready to take time and invest in new technologies here. Indian manufacturing is a very profit- first market, ROI [return on investment] driven. “And in a lot of cases, even the government is not ready to enable these industries through grants or tax relief, which makes it quite difficult. ” Comet is one Indian firm looking to innovate. It claims to be the first homegrown trainer brand that owns the whole production process, from design to manufacturing. “This level of control allows us to experiment with materials, introduce innovative silhouettes, and continuously refine comfort and fit based on real feedback,” says founder Utkarsh Gupta. He says the Comet shoes are adapted to India’s climate and roads. “Most homegrown brands rely on off-the-shelf soles from the market, but when we started Comet, we realized that these were lacking in quality, durability, and grip,” he says. Change is coming to the footwear sector he says. “The shift to high value is now happening. ” “Many high value brands need to move their manufacturing to India. In 3-5 years, we should have a robust ecosystem to compete in the international sneaker market,” he adds. Back in Agra, Ashok hopes that the unorganised sector is not neglected amid the growth of India’s footwear industry. “The government should give us accreditation and certificates so our factories don’t close down. Once we too are included in the organised sector no one can beat India in the shoe manufacturing industry. ” But Mr Sharma says change is inevitable. “The market is definitely going to shift. We’ll see the bigger players getting bigger - they have the money to adapt quickly. “But I don’t think the small guys will disappear completely. The smart ones will find their niche. ” "

    "body": "2025/04/07 - Here’s what you need to know: A former triathlete whose terminal cancer was initially mistaken for long Covid has been given months to live. Olivia Knowles, from Blackpool, noticed something “wasn’t quite correct” in August 2023 while competing in the Half Ironman World Championship in Lahti, Finland. The two-mile swim and 56-mile cycle went smoothly but she added she “just wasn’t able to push as hard as [she] normally would” during the 13-mile (20-km) run to the finish line. The 33-year-old went to a private doctor in November 2023 and was told it was “very likely to be long Covid”, before extreme toothache days later prompted an emergency hospital visit and a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). She said after a series of relapses and months of treatment over the course of last year, she had received a stem cell transplant in December and had been declared cancer-free. However, just a week later, in early March this year, Ms Knowles was given the “bitter” news the leukaemia had returned. The hair salon owner, whose “typical weekend” before her diagnosis involved 100-mile bike rides and 15-mile runs, walked 20 miles around Fairhaven Lake on 16 March to raise funds for clinical research at King’s College Hospital. She said she hoped any donations would improve research on AML, a particularly aggressive cancer which, she said, had not seen any “solid advancements” in treatment for 50 years. “I always thought that relapse would be a real possibility, but obviously, I just didn’t expect it to be so soon,” she said. “All I really miss now is going to work and training. That’s all I want – just my normal day and my normal routine. “It might sound odd to some people, but I would just love to take the dog for a run and go to work, more than anything. ” With AML, she explained: “Even if there’s a speck of it left, it just regrows. “And what regrows is basically the resistant cells, the ones that have evaded and resisted the previous chemo. ” Ms Knowles’ consultant at Blackpool Victoria Hospital had given her three options – try to get a transplant despite her relapse, join a clinical trial or “do nothing”. In November, after various unsuccessful trials, Olivia was given a novel Car-T treatment – immunotherapy which genetically modifies a patient’s T-cells to attack cancer. The treatment at King’s College Hospital in London was followed by the stem cell transplant. “The initial bone marrow findings were excellent,” she said. “There were no signs of disease. It was a really positive result at first. ” Last month, she was readmitted with gut issues, a common side effect of stem cell transplants, but blood tests “showed active disease”. Ms Knowles said her consultant had been “blindsided” by her relapse, because the transplant had gone so well. While home with her mum Susan and dad Stephen, she decided “on a little bit of a whim” to walk a marathon around Fairhaven Lake to raise funds for the clinical research team at King’s. The former triathlete was forced to stop after 20 miles but still raised more than £25,000. She hopes the money will contribute to “solid advancements”, saying the team at King’s were “on the cusp of something excellent with their development of Car-T treatment for AML”. “For them to have something that can help treat children, it gives you a bit more hope,” she said.

    "title": "Update: Why men are so unwellnessy - and what can be done",
    "body": "2025/04/06 - Experts revealed that This month the government in England will launch a consultation for its men’s health strategy. The move is long overdue, experts say, with men much more likely to die prematurely than women. But why are they in such poor health – and what can be done about it? Andrew Harrison was running a men’s health clinic from a youth centre in Bradford when he heard a knock. He turned to the door, but no-one was there. Then he heard his name being called. He looked around to see a young man at the window asking for condoms. “I was on the first floor,” he says, recounting the story from a few years ago. “The lad had shimmied up a drainpipe on the outside of the building because he didn’t want to go through the reception and ask. ” The anecdote, in many ways, encapsulates the challenges over men’s health – a combination of risk-taking behaviour and a lack of confidence and skills to engage with health services. In the UK men are more likely to smoke, drink alcohol, use drugs and have high cholesterol and blood pressure. These are major contributors to the fact men have a lower life expectancy than women - by four years - and are nearly 60% more likely to die prematurely before the age of 75 with heart disease, lung cancer, liver disease and in accidents. Prof Alan White, who co-founded the Men’s Health Forum charity and set up a dedicated men’s health centre at Leeds Beckett University, says the issue needs to be taken more seriously. He cites the pandemic as an example, pointing out that 19,000 more men than women died from Covid. “Where was the outrage? Where was the attention?” He says it is too easy to blame men’s poor health on their lifestyles, arguing “it’s much more complex than that. ” He says there are biological reasons – the male immune system is less able to fight off infection. But, as the story of the young man seeking condoms above demonstrates, they can also lack the skills to access health services. Prof White says: “Men are less health-literate, that is to say they don’t develop the skills to talk about their health and recognise and act on the signs. Men’s health is very static from their teenage years right through into their 40s generally – many go years without seeing a health professional. “It is different for women. Getting contraception, having cervical screening and then childbirth means many women have regular contact with health services in a way men do not. ” Machismo is also a factor, says Mark Brooks, the policy adviser for the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Men’s and Boy’s Issues, which has played a key role in influencing the government to draw up a men’s health strategy. “In society we have different expectations in regards to men. They are expected to man up and get on with things, to be strong and resilient. ” But he says when it comes to men’s health it is important to pay particular attention to the impact of deprivation. Life expectancy in the poorest 10% of areas is 10 years less than in the wealthiest – a larger gap than is seen for women – and in the most deprived areas a man is 3. 5 times more likely to die before the age of 75. “You cannot ignore the stark differences when it comes to left-behind communities and those working in blue-collar jobs like construction and manufacturing,” he says. “The way health services are designed isn’t working for men. ” NHS health checks, which are offered every five years to those aged 40 to 74, are considered a crucial intervention when it comes to many of the diseases which are claiming the lives of men early. But fewer than four in 10 men take up the offer. “Someone working in construction or on an industrial estate will find it very difficult to take time off whether that’s for a health check or to go and see their GP. ” Mr Brooks says he would like to see employees given a right to two hours’ paid time off to go for health checks as well as seeing them delivered in places where blue-collar workers are employed, such as industrial estates. But he says this is also an issue about employment - with some men in these roles scared to face up to health problems that develop in their 40s and 50s - ignoring early warning signs or hiding illnesses from bosses altogether because of what it may mean for their work. He adds that job worries and financial concerns, along with relationship problems, are a big driver in the high suicide rates seen among men. Three-quarters of people who take their own lives are men. Despite this, just a third of people sent for talking therapies are men, which may suggest that services are not doing enough to consider men’s needs. “How services are set up to recognise signs of depression and anxiety is not how men express them – they are more likely to display signs of anger, abuse alcohol or become withdrawn and push people away,” says Prof White. Ethnic differences are also important to recognise, he says. For example, black men in England are twice as likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer, while men from Indian or Bangladeshi backgrounds are at particularly high risk of diabetes. But none of this means men are not interested in their own health, says Prof Paul Galdas, a men’s health expert at York University. “Men will open up and want to be engaged, but to do that you have to base it around actions and activities. ” He has helped develop a six-week mental fitness programme in partnership with the Movember men’s health movement that has been trialled on NHS front-line workers following Covid. Now it is being used by Leeds United football club for its youth players. Men are provided with support to understand how behaviour affects moods, they are encouraged to track their habits and set goals for healthy activities. “It can be about going for a walk, seeing friends, playing golf and developing problem-solving skills to protect mental health. Good mental health leads to good physical health. ” Similar activity-based initiatives can be found in a number of local areas where charities, councils and local men’s groups have worked together to set up schemes. The Men’s Sheds movement is perhaps the most well-known where men are encouraged to come together and bond and support each other while doing practical projects. Prof White says now is the time to build on these foundations – something a national men’s health strategy is vital for. He says it will help “shine a spotlight” on the issue in a similar way to the women’s health strategy did back in 2022 – that led to the creation of a network of women’s health hubs and women’s health champions at the heart of government. But he also wants it to act as a “wake-up call” for men themselves. He says there are some simple steps every man should consider. “Look at your waist size – if you are carrying weight, if your tummy is too big try to do something. Get moving, get out and about and talk to people. “Take every opportunity to get a health check or screened. And, if you notice changes to body or the way you are managing problems, seek help. ” "

For example, black men in England are twice as likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer, while men from Indian or Bangladeshi backgrounds are at particularly high risk of diabetes. But none of this means men are not interested in their own health, says Prof Paul Galdas, a men’s health expert at York University. “Men will open up and want to be engaged, but to do that you have to base it around actions and activities. ” He has helped develop a six-week mental fitness programme in partnership with the Movember men’s health movement that has been trialled on NHS front-line workers following Covid. Now it is being used by Leeds United football club for its youth players. Men are provided with support to understand how behaviour affects moods, they are encouraged to track their habits and set goals for healthy activities. “It can be about going for a walk, seeing friends, playing golf and developing problem-solving skills to protect mental health. Good mental health leads to good physical health. ” Similar activity-based initiatives can be found in a number of local areas where charities, councils and local men’s groups have worked together to set up schemes. The Men’s Sheds movement is perhaps the most well-known where men are encouraged to come together and bond and support each other while doing practical projects. Prof White says now is the time to build on these foundations – something a national men’s health strategy is vital for. He says it will help “shine a spotlight” on the issue in a similar way to the women’s health strategy did back in 2022 – that led to the creation of a network of women’s health hubs and women’s health champions at the heart of government. But he also wants it to act as a “wake-up call” for men themselves. He says there are some simple steps every man should consider. “Look at your waist size – if you are carrying weight, if your tummy is too big try to do something. Get moving, get out and about and talk to people. “Take every opportunity to get a health check or screened. And, if you notice changes to body or the way you are managing problems, seek help. ” "

    "body": "2025/04/06 - Let’s dive into the details: This month the government in England will launch a consultation for its men’s health strategy. The move is long overdue, experts say, with men much more likely to die prematurely than women. But why are they in such poor health – and what can be done about it? Andrew Harrison was running a men’s health clinic from a youth centre in Bradford when he heard a knock. He turned to the door, but no-one was there. Then he heard his name being called. He looked around to see a young man at the window asking for condoms. “I was on the first floor,” he says, recounting the story from a few years ago. “The lad had shimmied up a drainpipe on the outside of the building because he didn’t want to go through the reception and ask. ” The anecdote, in many ways, encapsulates the challenges over men’s health – a combination of risk-taking behaviour and a lack of confidence and skills to engage with health services. In the UK men are more likely to smoke, drink alcohol, use drugs and have high cholesterol and blood pressure. These are major contributors to the fact men have a lower life expectancy than women - by four years - and are nearly 60% more likely to die prematurely before the age of 75 with heart disease, lung cancer, liver disease and in accidents. Prof Alan White, who co-founded the Men’s Health Forum charity and set up a dedicated men’s health centre at Leeds Beckett University, says the issue needs to be taken more seriously. He cites the pandemic as an example, pointing out that 19,000 more men than women died from Covid. “Where was the outrage? Where was the attention?” He says it is too easy to blame men’s poor health on their lifestyles, arguing “it’s much more complex than that. ” He says there are biological reasons – the male immune system is less able to fight off infection. But, as the story of the young man seeking condoms above demonstrates, they can also lack the skills to access health services. Prof White says: “Men are less health-literate, that is to say they don’t develop the skills to talk about their health and recognise and act on the signs. Men’s health is very static from their teenage years right through into their 40s generally – many go years without seeing a health professional. “It is different for women. Getting contraception, having cervical screening and then childbirth means many women have regular contact with health services in a way men do not. ” Machismo is also a factor, says Mark Brooks, the policy adviser for the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Men’s and Boy’s Issues, which has played a key role in influencing the government to draw up a men’s health strategy. “In society we have different expectations in regards to men. They are expected to man up and get on with things, to be strong and resilient. ” But he says when it comes to men’s health it is important to pay particular attention to the impact of deprivation. Life expectancy in the poorest 10% of areas is 10 years less than in the wealthiest – a larger gap than is seen for women – and in the most deprived areas a man is 3. 5 times more likely to die before the age of 75. “You cannot ignore the stark differences when it comes to left-behind communities and those working in blue-collar jobs like construction and manufacturing,” he says. “The way health services are designed isn’t working for men. ” NHS health checks, which are offered every five years to those aged 40 to 74, are considered a crucial intervention when it comes to many of the diseases which are claiming the lives of men early. But fewer than four in 10 men take up the offer. “Someone working in construction or on an industrial estate will find it very difficult to take time off whether that’s for a health check or to go and see their GP. ” Mr Brooks says he would like to see employees given a right to two hours’ paid time off to go for health checks as well as seeing them delivered in places where blue-collar workers are employed, such as industrial estates. But he says this is also an issue about employment - with some men in these roles scared to face up to health problems that develop in their 40s and 50s - ignoring early warning signs or hiding illnesses from bosses altogether because of what it may mean for their work. He adds that job worries and financial concerns, along with relationship problems, are a big driver in the high suicide rates seen among men. Three-quarters of people who take their own lives are men. Despite this, just a third of people sent for talking therapies are men, which may suggest that services are not doing enough to consider men’s needs. “How services are set up to recognise signs of depression and anxiety is not how men express them – they are more likely to display signs of anger, abuse alcohol or become withdrawn and push people away,” says Prof White.

    "title": "Update: Trump has turned his back on the foundation of US economic might - the fallout will be messy",
    "body": "2025/04/05 - According to new developments, President Donald Trump has built another wall, and he thinks everyone else is going to pay for it. But his decision to impose sweeping tariffs of at least 10% on almost every product that enters the US is essentially a wall designed to keep work and jobs within it, rather than immigrants out. The height of this wall needs to be put in historical context. It takes the US back a century in terms of protectionism. It catapults the US way above the G7 and G20 nations into levels of customs revenue, associated with Senegal, Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan. What occurred this week was not just the US starting a global trade war, or sparking a rout in stock markets. It was the world’s hyper power firmly turning its back on the globalisation process it had championed, and from which it handsomely profited in recent decades. And in so doing, using the equation that underpinned his grand tariff reveal on the Rose Garden’s lawns, the White House also turned its back on some fundamentals of both conventional economics and diplomacy. Trump talked a lot about 1913 in his announcement. This was a turning point when the US both created federal income tax and significantly lowered its tariffs. Before this point, from its inception, the US government was funded mainly by tariffs, and was unapologetically protectionist, based on the strategy of its first Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton. The basic lesson the White House has taken from this is that high tariffs made America, made it “great” the first time, and also meant that there was no need for a federal income tax. On this side of the Atlantic, underpinning globalisation and free trade are the theories of 19th-Century British economist David Ricardo. In particular, the 1817 Theory of Comparative Advantage. There are equations, but the basics are pretty easy to understand: Individual countries are good at making different things, based on their own natural resources and the ingenuity of their populations. Broadly speaking, the whole world, and the countries within it, are better off, if everyone specialises in what they are best at, and then trades freely. Here in Britain this remains a cornerstone of the junction between politics and economics. Most of the world still believes in comparative advantage. It is the intellectual core of globalisation. But the US was never a full convert at the time. The underlying reluctance of the US never disappeared. And this week’s manifestation of that was the imaginative equation created by the US Trade Representative to generate the numbers on Trump’s big board. It is worth unpacking the rationale for these so-called “reciprocal” tariffs. The numbers bear little resemblance to the published tariff rates in those countries. The White House said adjustments had been made to account for red tape and currency manipulation. A closer look at the, at-first, complicated looking equation revealed it was simply a measure of the size of that country’s goods trade surplus with the US. They took the size of the trade deficit and divided it by the imports. In the hour before the press conference a senior White House official explained it quite openly. “These tariffs are customised to each country, calculated by the Council of Economic Advisers… The model they use is based on the concept the trade deficit that we have is the sum of all the unfair trade practices, the sum of all cheating. ” This is really important. According to the White House, the act of selling more goods to the US than the US sells to you, is by definition “cheating” and is deserving of a tariff that is calculated to correct that imbalance. This is why the surreal stories about the US tariffing rarely visited islands only inhabited by penguins matter. It reveals the actual method. The long-term aim, and the target of the policy, is to get the US $1. 2 trillion trade deficit and the largest country deficits within that down to zero. The equation was simplistically designed to target those countries with surpluses, not those with recognisable quantifiable trade barriers. It targeted poor countries, emerging economies and tiny irrelevant islets based on that data. While these two different factors overlap, they are not the same thing. There are many reasons why some countries have surpluses, and some have deficits. There is no inherent reason why these numbers should be zero. Different countries are better at making different products, and have different natural and human resources. This is the very basis of trade. The US appears no longer to believe in this. Indeed if the same argument was applied solely to trade in services, the US has a $280bn (£216bn) surplus in areas such as financial services and social media tech. Yet services trade was excluded from all the White House calculations. There is something bigger here. As the US Vice President JD Vance said in a speech last month, globalisation has failed in the eyes of this administration because the idea was that “rich countries would move further up the value chain, while the poor countries made the simpler things”. That has not panned out, especially in the case of China, so the US is moving decisively away from this world. For the US, it is not David Ricardo who matters, it is David Autor, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economist and the coiner of the term “China shock”. In 2001, as the world was distracted by the aftermath of 9/11, China joined the World Trade Organisation (WTO), having relatively free access to US markets, and so transforming the global economy. Living standards, growth, profits and stock markets boomed in the US as China’s workforce migrated from the rural fields to the coastal factories to produce exports more cheaply for US consumers. It was a classic example of the functioning of “comparative advantage”. China generated trillions of dollars, much of which was reinvested in the US, in the form of its government bonds, helping keep interest rates down. Everyone was a winner. Well, not quite. Essentially US consumers en masse got richer with cheaper goods, but the quid pro quo was a profound loss of manufacturing to East Asia. Autor’s calculation was that by 2011, this “China shock” saw the loss of one million US manufacturing jobs, and 2. 4 million jobs overall. These hits were geographically concentrated in the Rust Belt and the south. The trade shock impact on lost jobs and wages was remarkably persistent. Autor further updated his analysis last year and found that while the Trump administration’s first term dabble with tariff protection had little net economic impact, it did loosen Democrat support in affected areas, and boosted support for Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Fast forward to this week, and the array of union car workers and oil and gas workers celebrating the tariffs in the White House. So the promise is that these jobs will return, not just to the Rust Belt, but across the US. This is indeed likely to some degree. The president’s clear message to foreign companies is to avoid the tariffs by moving your factories. The carrots offered by Biden followed by the stick from Trump could well lead to material progress on this. But the president’s characterisation of the past half century of freer trade as having “raped and pillaged” the US obviously doesn’t reflect the overall picture, even if it has not worked for specific regions, sectors or demographics. The US service sector thrived, dominating the world from Wall Street and Silicon Valley. US consumer brands used hyper-efficient supply chains stretching into China and East Asia to make incredible profits selling their aspirational American products everywhere. The US economy did very well indeed. The problem, simply, was that it was not evenly distributed among sectors. And what the US lacked was levels of redistribution and adaptation to spread that wealth across the country. This reflects America’s political choices. Now, as the US chooses to reshore its manufacturing with a sudden jolt of protectionism, other countries also have choices as to whether to support the flows of capital and trade that have made the US rich. The world’s consumers have choices. It is little wonder major blue chip American companies, which have built cash machines on hyper-efficient East Asian supply chains producing cheaply and then selling to the whole world based on their attractive aspirational brands, have a big problem. Their share prices are particularly badly affected because the president has both decimated their supply chain strategies, and also risks greatly impairing their brand image amongst global consumers. Ultimately, this is the first social media trade war. The experience of Tesla’s sale slump and Canada’s backlash against US goods may prove contagious. That would be as powerful as any counter-tariff. These countries that bet on being the workshops for US consumers have choices over trade too. New alliances will form and intensify that seek to cut out an erratic US. The president’s sensitivity to this was apparent when he threatened to increase tariffs if the EU and Canada joined forces over retaliation. This would be the nightmare scenario. In the game theory of trade wars, credibility does matter. The US has unrivalled military and technological might, which helps. But to transform the global trading system using an arbitrary formula, that throws up transparent absurdities, even without the penguins, is likely to encourage the other side to resist. This is especially the case when the rest of the world thinks that the loaded gun that the president is holding is being aimed at his own foot. The stock market fell most in the US. Inflation will go up most in the US. It is Wall Street now calculating a more-than-evens chance of a recession in the US. Perhaps there is some substance to the theory that the real objective here is to weaken the dollar and lower US borrowing costs. For now, the US is checking out of the global trade system it created. It can continue without it. But the transition is going to be very messy indeed.

It is little wonder major blue chip American companies, which have built cash machines on hyper-efficient East Asian supply chains producing cheaply and then selling to the whole world based on their attractive aspirational brands, have a big problem. Their share prices are particularly badly affected because the president has both decimated their supply chain strategies, and also risks greatly impairing their brand image amongst global consumers. Ultimately, this is the first social media trade war. The experience of Tesla’s sale slump and Canada’s backlash against US goods may prove contagious. That would be as powerful as any counter-tariff. These countries that bet on being the workshops for US consumers have choices over trade too. New alliances will form and intensify that seek to cut out an erratic US. The president’s sensitivity to this was apparent when he threatened to increase tariffs if the EU and Canada joined forces over retaliation. This would be the nightmare scenario. In the game theory of trade wars, credibility does matter. The US has unrivalled military and technological might, which helps. But to transform the global trading system using an arbitrary formula, that throws up transparent absurdities, even without the penguins, is likely to encourage the other side to resist. This is especially the case when the rest of the world thinks that the loaded gun that the president is holding is being aimed at his own foot. The stock market fell most in the US. Inflation will go up most in the US. It is Wall Street now calculating a more-than-evens chance of a recession in the US. Perhaps there is some substance to the theory that the real objective here is to weaken the dollar and lower US borrowing costs. For now, the US is checking out of the global trade system it created. It can continue without it. But the transition is going to be very messy indeed.

    "title": "Big News: Trump has turned his back on the foundation of US economic might - the fallout will be messy",
    "body": "2025/04/05 - Let’s dive into the details: President Donald Trump has built another wall, and he thinks everyone else is going to pay for it. But his decision to impose sweeping tariffs of at least 10% on almost every product that enters the US is essentially a wall designed to keep work and jobs within it, rather than immigrants out. The height of this wall needs to be put in historical context. It takes the US back a century in terms of protectionism. It catapults the US way above the G7 and G20 nations into levels of customs revenue, associated with Senegal, Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan. What occurred this week was not just the US starting a global trade war, or sparking a rout in stock markets. It was the world’s hyper power firmly turning its back on the globalisation process it had championed, and from which it handsomely profited in recent decades. And in so doing, using the equation that underpinned his grand tariff reveal on the Rose Garden’s lawns, the White House also turned its back on some fundamentals of both conventional economics and diplomacy. Trump talked a lot about 1913 in his announcement. This was a turning point when the US both created federal income tax and significantly lowered its tariffs. Before this point, from its inception, the US government was funded mainly by tariffs, and was unapologetically protectionist, based on the strategy of its first Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton. The basic lesson the White House has taken from this is that high tariffs made America, made it “great” the first time, and also meant that there was no need for a federal income tax. On this side of the Atlantic, underpinning globalisation and free trade are the theories of 19th-Century British economist David Ricardo. In particular, the 1817 Theory of Comparative Advantage. There are equations, but the basics are pretty easy to understand: Individual countries are good at making different things, based on their own natural resources and the ingenuity of their populations. Broadly speaking, the whole world, and the countries within it, are better off, if everyone specialises in what they are best at, and then trades freely. Here in Britain this remains a cornerstone of the junction between politics and economics. Most of the world still believes in comparative advantage. It is the intellectual core of globalisation. But the US was never a full convert at the time. The underlying reluctance of the US never disappeared. And this week’s manifestation of that was the imaginative equation created by the US Trade Representative to generate the numbers on Trump’s big board. It is worth unpacking the rationale for these so-called “reciprocal” tariffs. The numbers bear little resemblance to the published tariff rates in those countries. The White House said adjustments had been made to account for red tape and currency manipulation. A closer look at the, at-first, complicated looking equation revealed it was simply a measure of the size of that country’s goods trade surplus with the US. They took the size of the trade deficit and divided it by the imports. In the hour before the press conference a senior White House official explained it quite openly. “These tariffs are customised to each country, calculated by the Council of Economic Advisers… The model they use is based on the concept the trade deficit that we have is the sum of all the unfair trade practices, the sum of all cheating. ” This is really important. According to the White House, the act of selling more goods to the US than the US sells to you, is by definition “cheating” and is deserving of a tariff that is calculated to correct that imbalance. This is why the surreal stories about the US tariffing rarely visited islands only inhabited by penguins matter. It reveals the actual method. The long-term aim, and the target of the policy, is to get the US $1. 2 trillion trade deficit and the largest country deficits within that down to zero. The equation was simplistically designed to target those countries with surpluses, not those with recognisable quantifiable trade barriers. It targeted poor countries, emerging economies and tiny irrelevant islets based on that data. While these two different factors overlap, they are not the same thing. There are many reasons why some countries have surpluses, and some have deficits. There is no inherent reason why these numbers should be zero. Different countries are better at making different products, and have different natural and human resources. This is the very basis of trade. The US appears no longer to believe in this. Indeed if the same argument was applied solely to trade in services, the US has a $280bn (£216bn) surplus in areas such as financial services and social media tech. Yet services trade was excluded from all the White House calculations. There is something bigger here. As the US Vice President JD Vance said in a speech last month, globalisation has failed in the eyes of this administration because the idea was that “rich countries would move further up the value chain, while the poor countries made the simpler things”. That has not panned out, especially in the case of China, so the US is moving decisively away from this world. For the US, it is not David Ricardo who matters, it is David Autor, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economist and the coiner of the term “China shock”. In 2001, as the world was distracted by the aftermath of 9/11, China joined the World Trade Organisation (WTO), having relatively free access to US markets, and so transforming the global economy. Living standards, growth, profits and stock markets boomed in the US as China’s workforce migrated from the rural fields to the coastal factories to produce exports more cheaply for US consumers. It was a classic example of the functioning of “comparative advantage”. China generated trillions of dollars, much of which was reinvested in the US, in the form of its government bonds, helping keep interest rates down. Everyone was a winner. Well, not quite. Essentially US consumers en masse got richer with cheaper goods, but the quid pro quo was a profound loss of manufacturing to East Asia. Autor’s calculation was that by 2011, this “China shock” saw the loss of one million US manufacturing jobs, and 2. 4 million jobs overall. These hits were geographically concentrated in the Rust Belt and the south. The trade shock impact on lost jobs and wages was remarkably persistent. Autor further updated his analysis last year and found that while the Trump administration’s first term dabble with tariff protection had little net economic impact, it did loosen Democrat support in affected areas, and boosted support for Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Fast forward to this week, and the array of union car workers and oil and gas workers celebrating the tariffs in the White House. So the promise is that these jobs will return, not just to the Rust Belt, but across the US. This is indeed likely to some degree. The president’s clear message to foreign companies is to avoid the tariffs by moving your factories. The carrots offered by Biden followed by the stick from Trump could well lead to material progress on this. But the president’s characterisation of the past half century of freer trade as having “raped and pillaged” the US obviously doesn’t reflect the overall picture, even if it has not worked for specific regions, sectors or demographics. The US service sector thrived, dominating the world from Wall Street and Silicon Valley. US consumer brands used hyper-efficient supply chains stretching into China and East Asia to make incredible profits selling their aspirational American products everywhere. The US economy did very well indeed. The problem, simply, was that it was not evenly distributed among sectors. And what the US lacked was levels of redistribution and adaptation to spread that wealth across the country. This reflects America’s political choices. Now, as the US chooses to reshore its manufacturing with a sudden jolt of protectionism, other countries also have choices as to whether to support the flows of capital and trade that have made the US rich. The world’s consumers have choices. It is little wonder major blue chip American companies, which have built cash machines on hyper-efficient East Asian supply chains producing cheaply and then selling to the whole world based on their attractive aspirational brands, have a big problem. Their share prices are particularly badly affected because the president has both decimated their supply chain strategies, and also risks greatly impairing their brand image amongst global consumers. Ultimately, this is the first social media trade war. The experience of Tesla’s sale slump and Canada’s backlash against US goods may prove contagious.

    "title": "Latest: Starmer's response to Trump tariffs is both to slow down and go faster",
    "body": "2025/04/05 - Experts revealed that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer watched in his flat. Chancellor Rachel Reeves saw it in her study. The Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds, accompanied by staff and pizza, took in President Donald Trump’s big tariffs reveal on Wednesday from his office in Old Admiralty Arch, from where the British Navy was directed to protect and control trade on the high seas in days gone by. Ministers can only dream of having that kind of power now, as the UK watches on in growing horror at the bust-up between the US and China. “Sometimes people don’t realise they are living through a moment of history,” a cabinet minister notes, as Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping square up to each other, and stock markets plunge. Trump has slapped a 10% tariff on all nations – including the UK – for imports into the US, and much higher rates on some countries, including China, which has responded with fresh tariffs of its own. So what’s happening in Whitehall right now to try to limit the harm to the UK, perhaps by making a deal with the US, and make the most of any opportunities? The PM is spending another dramatic weekend working the phones from the peace of his country pad, Chequers. So far, the other calls that could really matter, from US negotiators, have not yet resumed. Trump dangled a possible trade deal that might exempt the UK from some of the costs from tariffs during the pair’s chummy White House press conference in February. There have been significant negotiations since then by a team of around 20, led out of No 10 by Michael Ellam, the Treasury and banking veteran, and the PM’s business adviser Varun Chandra alongside the business secretary. Those talks included ideas about the UK watering down rules on electric vehicles, possible changes to a tax on tech companies (“space to talk about it”, one minister says) and changes to online safety rules (“not happening”, says a government source). But as the US government prepared for its announcements on Wednesday, talks about a deal ground to a halt. Now, after the announcement, the “ball is in their court”, said one government source involved, waiting to hear if, in the chaos of Trump’s new tariff world, the White House can find time and energy to push a deal with the UK. “We’re expecting to hear from them any moment,” one of those involved hopes. The risk, in the visible turmoil, is that any economic agreement could become a case of: don’t call us, we’ll call you. We’ll be asking Darren Jones, the Treasury Minister, about it when he join us in the studio tomorrow. If a deal is done, however, do not expect an all-singing all-dancing arrangement. Instead, “it would be a basic agreement on principles – rather than a super detailed trade agreement”, says a government source, contrasting these “quick and dirty” moves to long-running negotiations with India (“we’re on our 15th chapter with them!”). Uncertainty around the talks, and the limited nature of what a deal could achieve in any case, means No 10 is “not sitting here waiting for it – it’s not the basket where all our eggs are”. For weeks the government told us they were preparing for all kinds of scenarios. A secret cabinet committee was considering how the UK might react if Trump’s tariffs materialised. But now they are here, the actual response is… not to respond, and to spend four weeks asking businesses if they would like the government to respond later on. That is not just Whitehall dither: at this stage, there seems to be almost zero appetite among ministers to join in with the rounds of tariffs between the US, China, and perhaps the EU in coming days. One Whitehall figure working with business says “there has not been a single voice in business, big or small, saying this is the wrong strategy”. Ministers’ approach to get businesses on board, like when Sir Keir invited dozens of big wigs to No 10 the morning after Trump’s tariff announcement, is in part because of the anger when the government increased National Insurance contributions. “The really calm reaction,” one source says, “is because we got people into the headspace where tariffs were going to happen – one of the businesses said they were being borderline stalked, we’ve been trying to persuade business to trust the process. ” The government is in no rush, and has no enthusiasm to introduce its own new tariffs, and for now at least, demands on them to do so are muted. According to a minister: “Most people have considerable numbers of jobs in their constituencies on the line – even in cabinet there might have been some question marks but there weren’t this week. ” And they joke that the Lib Dems, who are calling for tariffs in retaliation, “keep demanding a trade war but I don’t think they’ll lead the nation”. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who also does not want extra tariffs, will be on tomorrow’s show too. But just as the government is going slow on hitting back, they are cracking heads to crack on with their existing plans faster. This isn’t all about Trump. I understand the chancellor is looking at whether any of the money announced in the government’s vital Spending Review can be brought forward from June. If government departments are able to finalise their deals, can that be sorted and made public as soon as possible? There are discussions too about whether it’s possible to speed up the long waited-for Industrial Strategy – a plan to get investment into the UK pencilled in for June, but could it be brought forward? A decision hasn’t been made but the prime minister is again, his team indicate, trying to use the jeopardy around the world as an impetus to push the government machine harder. “We have to run quickly towards this,” a government source says – and the chancellor is looking at it this weekend. Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg’s expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you. You might feel, haven’t I heard this before? You’d be right. Since the start of the year, the prime minister and the chancellor have both repeatedly said the government has to go faster, work harder. So why after years in opposition weren’t Starmer’s team ready to go with all of these changes when they got into office? For a government that promised to be radical, its plans have not always been forthcoming. You may not fancy the kind of radicalism we’re seeing out of the White House, but radical it certainly is. To compete, the UK may need to be that too. It is ludicrous to imagine the PM is “very happy” that the UK has been hit with tariffs as Trump suggested – “artistic licence”, a government source remarked. No British action can completely insulate our economy from disruption abroad. But the government’s own actions do matter, and this could be a defining moment. While there’s been no lack of trying to soften the blows for the UK, the government’s hopes have been dashed already. First, ministers believed the UK could escape tariffs, then they said they were prepared in case, then disappointed when they arrived. As Sir Keir spends another weekend on the phone, and his officials wait for their phone to ring, the government doesn’t know what it will be able to say next.

    "title": "Latest: Woman contacted by stranger on DNA site - and the truth about her birth unravelled",
    "body": "2025/04/05 - According to new developments, Susan was no more than puzzled when she saw the first results from her home DNA testing kit. Now a woman in her mid 70s, she had never known much about her grandfather, and paid for the private test to see if it threw up anything unusual. “I did notice there was a lot of Irish heritage, which as far as I knew was wrong,” she says. “But I just pushed it aside and didn’t think any more of it. I stopped paying for my subscription and that was that. ” Except it very much wasn’t. It took another six years for Susan - not her real name - to realise everything she knew about her family history was wrong. She later found out that back in the 1950s, she had been swapped at birth for another baby girl in a busy NHS maternity ward. Her case is now the second of its type uncovered by the BBC. Lawyers say they expect more to come forward driven by the boom in cheap genetic testing and ancestry websites. A sharp, funny woman with shoulder-length white hair, Susan tells me her story from her sunny front room somewhere in southern England. Her husband is sitting next to her, jogging her memory and chipping in from time to time. After taking that DNA test almost a decade ago, the genealogy company entered her data into its vast family tree, allowing other users to make contact with their genetic relatives – close or distant. Six years later she received a message out of the blue. The stranger said that his data matched hers in a way that could only mean one thing: he must be her genetic sibling. “That was just panic. It was every emotion I could think of, my brain was all over the place,” she says. Susan’s first reaction was that she may have been secretly adopted. Both her parents had died some years before, so she plucked up the courage and asked her older brother. He was sure the whole thing was a scam. His sister had always been part of his life, and he was “absolutely certain” that one of his first memories was of his mother being pregnant. Susan though still had her suspicions. She was slightly taller than her brother and, with her striking blonde hair, had never looked like the rest of family. Her eldest daughter did some digging and found a copy of all the births registered in the local area on the day her mother was born. The next baby girl on the list, registered at the same NHS hospital, had the exact same surname as the man who had contacted her through the genealogy website. It couldn’t be a coincidence. The only possible explanation was a mistake or mix-up in that maternity ward more than seven decades ago. Until recently cases like this were unheard of in the UK, although there have been a handful of examples in other countries. The standard practice in the NHS today is to place two bands around babies’ ankles immediately after birth and keep mother and child together through their hospital stay. In the 1950s maternity care was very different. Babies were often separated, placed in large nursery rooms and cared for by midwives. “The whole system was far less sophisticated back then,” says Jason Tang, from the London law firm Russell Cooke, which is representing Susan. “It may be that staff didn’t attach a card or tag immediately, or that it simply fell off and was put back on the wrong baby or on the wrong crib. ” From the late 1940s the UK also saw a post-war baby boom putting more pressure on busy maternity services in the newly formed NHS. This, of course, meant nothing to Susan for decades. She grew up as part of a “normal, working class” household, met her husband and ended up working for the NHS herself in a “hands-on” clinical role. Other than “a bit of the usual trauma” in her teenage years, she remembers her parents as a “very good, loving” couple who “did everything they could and always encouraged me”. “In a way, I’m so glad they are not here anymore to see this,” says Susan. “If they are up there watching me, I really hope they don’t know what’s gone on. ” If home DNA tests had been available earlier, she doesn’t think she could have told them the truth “because it would have been so awful”. “But I really don’t think that for me, anything has changed about them, they are still mum and dad,” she says. On the other hand, her relationship with the man she has always known as her older brother has, she thinks, been strengthened by what she’s gone through. “It’s actually brought us closer together. Now we meet up more often and I get cards sent to ‘my dear sister’,” she says. “Both he and his wife have been absolutely fantastic, honestly I cannot praise them enough. ” She remembers receiving another “lovely letter” from a cousin at the time who told her, “Oh don’t worry, you’re still part of the family”. As for her new blood relations, she says the situation has been more difficult. She has met up with the man who contacted her, her biological sibling, and laughs as she remembers how similar they both looked. “If you’d put a wig on him and a bit of makeup, it could honestly have been me,” she jokes. She has also seen photographs of the other woman who she was swapped with at birth, and her sons. But building a relationship with that new side of her family has not been easy. “I know they are my biological relatives but I didn’t grow up with them so there’s not that emotional connection there,” she says. “They closed ranks, basically, through loyalty to their sister which is admirable and I understand. ” Susan’s genetic parents died some years ago but she’s been told she looks like her biological mother. “I’d still like to know a bit more about her – what she was like and all that – but I never will, so there you go,” she says. “But if I take the emotion out of it, and just think logically and clearly, I was better off how I grew up. ” Susan is one of the first to ever receive compensation - the amount is not being disclosed - in a case like this. She needed to take a second DNA test before the NHS trust involved accepted its historic mistake and made a “very lovely” apology. Last year, the BBC reported on another decades-old case of babies swapped at birth, which again came to light after someone was given a DNA testing kit for Christmas. Susan says the settlement was never about money but the recognition a mistake had been made all those years ago. “I suppose you always want someone to blame, don’t you?” she asks. “But I know this will be with me for the rest of my life. I just wanted a conclusion. ” "

    "title": "Update: 'I could live 30 years but plan to die' - How assisted dying law is dividing Canadians",
    "body": "2025/04/04 - Let’s dive into the details: April Hubbard sits on the theatre stage where she plans to die later this year. She is not terminally ill, but the 39-year-old performance and burlesque artist has been approved for assisted dying under Canada’s increasingly liberal laws. Warning: This article contains details and descriptions some readers may find disturbing She is speaking to BBC News from the Bus Stop Theatre, an intimate auditorium with a little under 100 seats, in the eastern city of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Illuminated by a single spotlight on a stage she has performed on many times before, she tells me she plans to die here “within months” of her imminent 40th birthday. She’ll be joined by a small group of her family and friends. April plans to be in a “big comfy bed” for what she calls a “celebratory” moment when a medical professional will inject a lethal dose into her bloodstream. “I want to be surrounded by the people I love and just have everybody hold me in a giant cuddle puddle and get to take my last breath, surrounded by love and support,” she says. April was born with spina bifida and was later diagnosed with tumours at the base of her spine which she says have left her in constant, debilitating pain. She’s been taking strong opioid painkillers for more than 20 years and applied for Medical Assistance in Dying (Maid) in March 2023. While she could yet live for decades with her condition, she qualified to end her life early seven months after applying. For those who are terminally ill it is possible to get approval within 24 hours. “My suffering and pain are increasing and I don’t have the quality of life anymore that makes me happy and fulfilled,” April says. Every time she moves or breathes, she says it feels like the tissues from the base of her spine “are being pulled like a rubber band that stretches too far”, and that her lower limbs leave her in agony. We meet April as, almost 3,000 miles away, MPs are scrutinising proposals to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales. They voted in principle in support of those plans in November 2024, but months of detailed scrutiny have followed - and further votes in the Commons and Lords are required before the bill could possibly become law. This week, the BBC witnessed a man’s death in California, where assisted dying laws are far more similar to those being considered in Westminster. Critics say Canada is an example of the “slippery slope”, meaning that once you pass an assisted dying law it will inevitably widen its scope and have fewer safeguards. Canada now has one of the most liberal systems of assisted dying in the world, similar to that operating in the Netherlands and Belgium. It introduced Maid in 2016, initially for terminally ill adults with a serious and incurable physical illness, which causes intolerable suffering. In 2021, the need to be terminally ill was removed, and in two years’ time, the Canadian government plans to open Maid to adults solely with a mental illness and no physical ailment. Opponents of Maid tell us that death is coming to be seen as a standard treatment option for those with disabilities and complex medical problems. “It is easier in Canada to get medical assistance in dying than it is to get government support to live,” says Andrew Gurza, a disability awareness consultant and friend of April’s. Andrew, who has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, says he respects April’s decision, but tells us: “If my disability declines and my care needs got higher, I’d still want to be here. To know there’s a law that’s saying you could easily end your life - it’s just really scary. ” Before she was approved for Maid, April was assessed by two independent physicians who were required to inform her of ways to alleviate her suffering and offer alternative treatments. “The safeguards are there,” she says, when we press her about disabled people who feel threatened by assisted dying, or whether Maid is being used as a shortcut to better quality care. “If it’s not right for you and you’re not leading the charge and choosing Maid, you’re not going to be able to access it unless it’s for the right reasons,” she adds. There were 15,343 Maid deaths in 2023, representing around one in 20 of all deaths in Canada - a proportion that has increased dramatically since 2016 and is one of the highest in the world. The average age of recipients was 77. In all but a handful of cases, the lethal dose was delivered by a doctor or nurse, which is also known as voluntary euthanasia. One doctor we spoke to, Eric Thomas, said he had helped 577 patients to die. Dr Konia Trouton, president of the Canadian Association of Maid Assessors and Providers, has also helped hundreds of patients to die since the law was introduced. The procedure is the same each time - she arrives at the home of the person who has been given approval for Maid and asks if they wish to go ahead with it that day. She says the patients always direct the process and then give her the “heads up and ready to go”. “That gives me an honour and a duty and a privilege to be able to help them in those last moments with their family around them, with those who love them around them and to know that they’ve made that decision thoughtfully, carefully and thoroughly,” she adds.  If the answer is yes, she opens her medical bag. Demonstrating to the BBC what happens next, Dr Trouton briefly puts a tourniquet on my arm. She shows me where the needle would be inserted into a vein in the back of my hand to allow an intravenous infusion of lethal drugs. In her medical bag she also has a stethoscope. “Strangely, these days I use it more to determine if someone has no heartbeat rather than if they do,” she tells me. A list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line Some 96% of Maid provisions are under “track one” where death is “reasonably foreseeable”. Dr Trouton says that means patients are on a “trajectory toward death”, which might range from someone who has rapidly spreading cancer and only weeks to live or another with Alzheimer’s “who might have five to seven years”. The other 4% of Maid deaths come under “track two”. These are adults, like April, who are not dying but have suffering which is intolerable to them from a “grievous and irremediable medical condition”. That is in stark contrast to Labour MP Kim Leadbeater’s bill to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales, which says patients must be expected to die within six months. The Westminster bill would not allow doctors to give a lethal dose – rather patients would have to self-administer the drugs, usually by swallowing them. Death via intravenous infusion normally takes just a few minutes, as the lethal drugs go straight into the bloodstream, whereas swallowing the drugs means patients usually take around an hour or two to die, but can take considerably longer, although they are usually unconscious after a few minutes. Dr Trouton told me she regarded the Canadian system as quicker and more effective, as do other Maid providers. “I’m concerned that if some people can’t swallow because of their disease process, and if they’re not able to take the entire quantity of medication because of breathing difficulties or swallowing difficulties, what will happen?” But opponents argue it’s being used as a cheaper alternative to providing adequate social or medical support. One of them is Dr Ramona Coelho, a GP in London, Ontario, whose practice serves many marginalised groups and those struggling to get medical and social support. She’s part of a Maid Death Review Committee, alongside Dr Trouton, which examines cases in the province. Dr Coelho told me that Maid was “out of control”. “I wouldn’t even call it a slippery slope,” she says “Canada has fallen off a cliff. ” “When people have suicidal ideations, we used to meet them with counselling and care, and for people with terminal illness and other diseases we could mitigate that suffering and help them have a better life,” she says. “Yet now we are seeing that as an appropriate request to die and ending their lives very quickly. ” While at Dr Coelho’s surgery I was introduced to Vicki Whelan, a retired nurse whose mum Sharon Scribner died in April 2023 of lung cancer, aged 81. Vicki told me that in her mum’s final days in hospital she was repeatedly offered the option of Maid by medical staff, describing it as like a “sales pitch”. The family, who are Catholic, discharged their mother so she could die at home, where Vicki says her mum had a “beautiful, peaceful death”. “It makes us think that we can’t endure, and we can’t suffer a little bit, and that somehow now they’ve decided that dying needs to be assisted, where we’ve been dying for years. “All of a sudden now we’re telling people that this is a better option. This is an easy way out and I think it’s just robbing people of hope. ” So is Canada an example of the so-called slippery slope? It’s certainly true that the eligibility criteria has broadened dramatically since the law was introduced nine years ago, so for critics the answer would be an emphatic yes and serve as a warning to Britain. Canada’s assisted dying laws were driven by court rulings. Its Supreme Court instructed Parliament that a prohibition on assisted dying breached the country’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The extension of eligibility for those who were not terminally ill was in part a response to another court decision. In Britain, judges in the most senior courts have repeatedly said any potential change to the law around assisted dying is a matter for Parliament, after the likes of Tony Nicklinson, Diane Pretty and Noel Conway brought cases arguing the blanket ban on assisted suicide breached their human rights. April knows some people may look at her, a young woman, and wonder why she would die. “We’re the masters of masking and not letting people see that we’re suffering,” she says. “But in reality, there’s days that I just can’t hide it, and there’s many days where I can’t lift my head off the pillow and I can’t eat anymore. “It’s not a way I want to live for another 10 or 20 or 30 years. ” Additional reporting by Joshua Falcon.

Canada’s assisted dying laws were driven by court rulings. Its Supreme Court instructed Parliament that a prohibition on assisted dying breached the country’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The extension of eligibility for those who were not terminally ill was in part a response to another court decision. In Britain, judges in the most senior courts have repeatedly said any potential change to the law around assisted dying is a matter for Parliament, after the likes of Tony Nicklinson, Diane Pretty and Noel Conway brought cases arguing the blanket ban on assisted suicide breached their human rights. April knows some people may look at her, a young woman, and wonder why she would die. “We’re the masters of masking and not letting people see that we’re suffering,” she says. “But in reality, there’s days that I just can’t hide it, and there’s many days where I can’t lift my head off the pillow and I can’t eat anymore. “It’s not a way I want to live for another 10 or 20 or 30 years. ” Additional reporting by Joshua Falcon.

    "body": "2025/04/04 - It has been recently reported that April Hubbard sits on the theatre stage where she plans to die later this year. She is not terminally ill, but the 39-year-old performance and burlesque artist has been approved for assisted dying under Canada’s increasingly liberal laws. Warning: This article contains details and descriptions some readers may find disturbing She is speaking to BBC News from the Bus Stop Theatre, an intimate auditorium with a little under 100 seats, in the eastern city of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Illuminated by a single spotlight on a stage she has performed on many times before, she tells me she plans to die here “within months” of her imminent 40th birthday. She’ll be joined by a small group of her family and friends. April plans to be in a “big comfy bed” for what she calls a “celebratory” moment when a medical professional will inject a lethal dose into her bloodstream. “I want to be surrounded by the people I love and just have everybody hold me in a giant cuddle puddle and get to take my last breath, surrounded by love and support,” she says. April was born with spina bifida and was later diagnosed with tumours at the base of her spine which she says have left her in constant, debilitating pain. She’s been taking strong opioid painkillers for more than 20 years and applied for Medical Assistance in Dying (Maid) in March 2023. While she could yet live for decades with her condition, she qualified to end her life early seven months after applying. For those who are terminally ill it is possible to get approval within 24 hours. “My suffering and pain are increasing and I don’t have the quality of life anymore that makes me happy and fulfilled,” April says. Every time she moves or breathes, she says it feels like the tissues from the base of her spine “are being pulled like a rubber band that stretches too far”, and that her lower limbs leave her in agony. We meet April as, almost 3,000 miles away, MPs are scrutinising proposals to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales. They voted in principle in support of those plans in November 2024, but months of detailed scrutiny have followed - and further votes in the Commons and Lords are required before the bill could possibly become law. This week, the BBC witnessed a man’s death in California, where assisted dying laws are far more similar to those being considered in Westminster. Critics say Canada is an example of the “slippery slope”, meaning that once you pass an assisted dying law it will inevitably widen its scope and have fewer safeguards. Canada now has one of the most liberal systems of assisted dying in the world, similar to that operating in the Netherlands and Belgium. It introduced Maid in 2016, initially for terminally ill adults with a serious and incurable physical illness, which causes intolerable suffering. In 2021, the need to be terminally ill was removed, and in two years’ time, the Canadian government plans to open Maid to adults solely with a mental illness and no physical ailment. Opponents of Maid tell us that death is coming to be seen as a standard treatment option for those with disabilities and complex medical problems. “It is easier in Canada to get medical assistance in dying than it is to get government support to live,” says Andrew Gurza, a disability awareness consultant and friend of April’s. Andrew, who has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, says he respects April’s decision, but tells us: “If my disability declines and my care needs got higher, I’d still want to be here. To know there’s a law that’s saying you could easily end your life - it’s just really scary. ” Before she was approved for Maid, April was assessed by two independent physicians who were required to inform her of ways to alleviate her suffering and offer alternative treatments. “The safeguards are there,” she says, when we press her about disabled people who feel threatened by assisted dying, or whether Maid is being used as a shortcut to better quality care. “If it’s not right for you and you’re not leading the charge and choosing Maid, you’re not going to be able to access it unless it’s for the right reasons,” she adds. There were 15,343 Maid deaths in 2023, representing around one in 20 of all deaths in Canada - a proportion that has increased dramatically since 2016 and is one of the highest in the world. The average age of recipients was 77. In all but a handful of cases, the lethal dose was delivered by a doctor or nurse, which is also known as voluntary euthanasia. One doctor we spoke to, Eric Thomas, said he had helped 577 patients to die. Dr Konia Trouton, president of the Canadian Association of Maid Assessors and Providers, has also helped hundreds of patients to die since the law was introduced. The procedure is the same each time - she arrives at the home of the person who has been given approval for Maid and asks if they wish to go ahead with it that day. She says the patients always direct the process and then give her the “heads up and ready to go”. “That gives me an honour and a duty and a privilege to be able to help them in those last moments with their family around them, with those who love them around them and to know that they’ve made that decision thoughtfully, carefully and thoroughly,” she adds.  If the answer is yes, she opens her medical bag. Demonstrating to the BBC what happens next, Dr Trouton briefly puts a tourniquet on my arm. She shows me where the needle would be inserted into a vein in the back of my hand to allow an intravenous infusion of lethal drugs. In her medical bag she also has a stethoscope. “Strangely, these days I use it more to determine if someone has no heartbeat rather than if they do,” she tells me. A list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line Some 96% of Maid provisions are under “track one” where death is “reasonably foreseeable”. Dr Trouton says that means patients are on a “trajectory toward death”, which might range from someone who has rapidly spreading cancer and only weeks to live or another with Alzheimer’s “who might have five to seven years”. The other 4% of Maid deaths come under “track two”. These are adults, like April, who are not dying but have suffering which is intolerable to them from a “grievous and irremediable medical condition”. That is in stark contrast to Labour MP Kim Leadbeater’s bill to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales, which says patients must be expected to die within six months. The Westminster bill would not allow doctors to give a lethal dose – rather patients would have to self-administer the drugs, usually by swallowing them. Death via intravenous infusion normally takes just a few minutes, as the lethal drugs go straight into the bloodstream, whereas swallowing the drugs means patients usually take around an hour or two to die, but can take considerably longer, although they are usually unconscious after a few minutes. Dr Trouton told me she regarded the Canadian system as quicker and more effective, as do other Maid providers. “I’m concerned that if some people can’t swallow because of their disease process, and if they’re not able to take the entire quantity of medication because of breathing difficulties or swallowing difficulties, what will happen?” But opponents argue it’s being used as a cheaper alternative to providing adequate social or medical support. One of them is Dr Ramona Coelho, a GP in London, Ontario, whose practice serves many marginalised groups and those struggling to get medical and social support. She’s part of a Maid Death Review Committee, alongside Dr Trouton, which examines cases in the province. Dr Coelho told me that Maid was “out of control”. “I wouldn’t even call it a slippery slope,” she says “Canada has fallen off a cliff. ” “When people have suicidal ideations, we used to meet them with counselling and care, and for people with terminal illness and other diseases we could mitigate that suffering and help them have a better life,” she says. “Yet now we are seeing that as an appropriate request to die and ending their lives very quickly. ” While at Dr Coelho’s surgery I was introduced to Vicki Whelan, a retired nurse whose mum Sharon Scribner died in April 2023 of lung cancer, aged 81. Vicki told me that in her mum’s final days in hospital she was repeatedly offered the option of Maid by medical staff, describing it as like a “sales pitch”. The family, who are Catholic, discharged their mother so she could die at home, where Vicki says her mum had a “beautiful, peaceful death”. “It makes us think that we can’t endure, and we can’t suffer a little bit, and that somehow now they’ve decided that dying needs to be assisted, where we’ve been dying for years. “All of a sudden now we’re telling people that this is a better option. This is an easy way out and I think it’s just robbing people of hope. ” So is Canada an example of the so-called slippery slope? It’s certainly true that the eligibility criteria has broadened dramatically since the law was introduced nine years ago, so for critics the answer would be an emphatic yes and serve as a warning to Britain. Canada’s assisted dying laws were driven by court rulings. Its Supreme Court instructed Parliament that a prohibition on assisted dying breached the country’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

    "title": "Update: California man invites BBC to witness his death as MPs debate assisted dying",
    "body": "2025/04/03 - Here’s what you need to know: It’s 10am, and in a little over two hours, Wayne Hawkins will be dead. The sun is shining on the bungalow where the 80-year-old lives in San Diego, California with his wife of more than five decades, Stella. I knock on the door and meet his children - Emily, 48, and Ashley, 44 - who have spent the last two weeks at their father’s side. Wayne sits in a reclining chair where he spends most of his days. Terminally ill, he is too weak to leave the house. He has invited BBC News to witness his death under California’s assisted dying laws - if MPs in London vote to legalise the practice in England and Wales, it will allow some terminally ill people here to die in a similar way. Warning: This article contains details and descriptions some readers may find disturbing Half an hour after arriving at Wayne’s house, I watch him swallow three anti-nausea tablets, designed to minimise the risk of him vomiting the lethal medication he plans to take shortly. Are you sure this day is your last, I ask him? “I’m all in,” he replies. “I was determined and decided weeks ago - I’ve had no trepidation since then. ” His family ask for one last photo, which I take, and you can see at the top of this page. As usual, Stella and Wayne are holding hands. Shortly after, Dr Donnie Moore arrives. He has got to know the family over the past few weeks, visiting them on several occasions alongside running his own end-of-life clinic. Under California law, he is what is known as the attending physician who must confirm, in addition to a second doctor, that Wayne is eligible for aid in dying. Dr Moore’s role is part physician, part counsellor in this situation, one he has been in for 150 assisted deaths before. On a top shelf in Wayne’s bedroom sits a brown glass bottle containing a fine white powder - a mixture of five drugs, sedatives and painkillers, delivered to the house four weeks before. The dosage of drugs inside is hundreds of times higher than those used in regular healthcare and is “guaranteed” to be fatal, Dr Moore explains. Unlike California, the proposed law at Westminster would require a doctor to bring any such medication with them. When Wayne signals he is ready, the doctor mixes the meds with cherry and pineapple juice to soften the bitter taste - and he hands this pink liquid to Wayne. No one, not even the doctor, knows how long it will take him to die after taking the lethal drugs. Dr Moore explains to me that, in his experience, death usually occurs between 30 minutes and two hours of ingestion, but on one occasion it took 17 hours. This is the story of how and why Wayne chose to die. And why others have decided not to follow the same course. We first met the couple a few weeks earlier, when Wayne explained why he was going ahead with the decision to have an assisted death - a controversial measure in other parts of the world. “Some days the pain is almost more than I can handle,” he said. “I just don’t see any merit to dying slow and painfully, hooked up with stuff - intubation, feeding tubes,” he told me. “I want none of it. ” Wayne said he had watched two relatives die “miserable”, “heinous” deaths from heart failure. “I hate hospitals, they are miserable. I will die in the street first. ” Wayne met Stella in 1969; the couple married four years later. He told us it was something of an arranged marriage, as his mother kept inviting Stella for dinner until eventually the penny dropped that he should take her out. They lived for many years in Arcata, northern California, surrounded by sweeping forests of redwood trees, where Wayne worked as a landscape architect, while Stella was a primary school teacher. They spent their holidays hiking and camping with their children. Now Wayne is terminally ill with heart failure, which has already brought him close to death. He has myriad other health issues including prostate cancer, liver failure and sepsis which brings him serious spinal pain. He is expected to live less than six months, qualifying him for an assisted death in California. His request to die has been approved by two doctors and the lethal medication is self-administered. It was during our first meeting that he asked the BBC to return to observe his final day, saying he wanted terminally ill adults in the UK to have the same right to an assisted death as him. “Britain is pretty good with freedoms and this is just another one,” he said. “People should be able to choose the time of their death as long as they meet the rules like six months to live or less. ” Stella, 78, supports his decision. “I’ve known him for over 50 years. He’s a very independent man. He’s always known what he wants to do and he’s always fixed things. That’s how he’s operating now. If this is his choice, I definitely agree, and I’ve seen him really suffer with the illness he’s got. I don’t want that for him. ” Wayne would also qualify under the proposed new assisted dying law in England and Wales. The measures return to the House of Commons later this month, when all MPs will have a chance to debate and vote on changes to the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill. The proposed legislation, tabled by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, says that anyone who wants to end their life must have the mental capacity to make the choice, that they must be expected to die within six months, and must make two separate declarations - witnessed and signed - about their wish to die. They must satisfy two independent doctors that they are eligible. MPs in Westminster voted in favour of assisted dying in principle last November but remain bitterly divided on the issue. If they ultimately decide to approve the bill, it could become law within the next year and come into practice within the next four years. A list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line There are also divisions here in California, where assisted dying was introduced in 2016. Michelle and Mike Carter, both 72 and married for 43 years, are each being treated for cancer - Mike has prostate cancer that has spread to his lymph nodes, and Michelle’s advanced terminal ovarian cancer has spread throughout much of her body. “I held my mother’s hand when she passed; I held my father’s hand when he passed,” Michelle told me. “I believe there’s freedom of choice however for me, I choose palliative care… I have God and I have good medicine. ” Michelle’s physician, palliative care specialist Dr Vincent Nguyen, argued that assisted dying laws in the US state lead to “silent coercion” whereby vulnerable people think their only option is to die. “Instead of ending people’s lives, let’s put programmes together to care for people,” he said. “Let them know that they’re loved, they’re wanted and they’re worthy. ” He said the law meant that doctors have gone from being seen as healers to killers, while the message from the healthcare system was that “you are better off dead, because you’re expensive and your death is cheaper for us”. Some disability campaigners say assisted dying makes them feel unsafe. Ingrid Tischer, who has muscular dystrophy and chronic respiratory failure, told me: “The message that it sends to people with disabilities in California is that you deserve suicide assistance rather than suicide prevention when you voice a desire to end your life. “What does that say about who we are as a culture?” Critics often say that once assisted dying is legalised, over time the safeguards around such laws get eroded as part of a “slippery slope” towards more relaxed criteria. In California, there was initially a mandatory 15-day cooling off period between patients making a first and second request for aid in dying. That has been reduced to 48 hours because many patients were dying during the waiting period. It’s thought the approval process envisaged in Westminster would take around a month. Outside Wayne’s house on the morning of his death, a solitary bird begins its loud and elaborate song. “There’s that mockingbird out there,” Wayne tells Stella, as smiles flicker across their faces. Wayne hates the bird because it keeps him awake at night, Stella jokes, hand in hand with him to one side of his chair. Emily and Ashley are next to Stella. Dr Moore, seated on Wayne’s other side, hands him the pink liquid which he swallows without hesitation. “Goodnight,” he says to his family - a typical touch of humour from a man who told us he was determined to die on his terms. It’s 11. 47am. After two minutes, Wayne says he is getting sleepy. Dr Moore asks him to imagine he is walking in a vast sea of flowers with a soft breeze on his skin, which seems appropriate for a patient who has spent much of his life among nature. After three minutes Wayne enters a deep sleep from which he will never wake. On a few occasions he lifts his head to take a deep breath without opening his eyes, at one point beginning to snore softly. Dr Moore tells the family this is “the deepest sleep imaginable” and reassures Emily there is no chance her dad will wake up and ask, “did it work?” “Oh that would be just like him,” Stella says with a laugh. The family start to reminisce about hiking holidays and driving around in a large van they converted to become a camper. “Me and dad insulated it and put a bed in the back,” says Ashley. On the walls are photos of Emily and Ashley as small children next to huge carved Halloween pumpkins. Dr Moore is still stroking Wayne’s hand and occasionally checking his pulse. For a man who Emily says was “always walking, always outdoors, always active”, these are the final moments of life’s journey, spent surrounded by those who mean most to him. At 12. 22pm Dr Moore says, “I think he’s passed… He’s at peace now. ” Outside, the mockingbird has fallen silent. “No more pain,” says Stella, embracing her children in her arms. I step outside to give the family some space, and reflect on what we have just seen and filmed. I have been covering medical ethics for the BBC for more than 20 years. In 2006, I was present just outside an apartment in Zurich where Dr Anne Turner, a retired doctor, died with the help of the group Dignitas - but California was the first time I had been an eyewitness to an assisted death. This isn’t just a story about one man’s death in California - it’s about what could become a reality here in England and Wales for those who qualify for an assisted death and choose to die this way. Whether you’re for or against the proposed new Westminster law, the death of a loved one is a deeply personal and emotional time for a family. Each death leaves an imprint, as will Wayne’s.

Whether you’re for or against the proposed new Westminster law, the death of a loved one is a deeply personal and emotional time for a family. Each death leaves an imprint, as will Wayne’s.

    "title": "Big News: California man invites BBC to witness his death as MPs debate assisted dying",
    "body": "2025/04/03 - Let’s dive into the details: It’s 10am, and in a little over two hours, Wayne Hawkins will be dead. The sun is shining on the bungalow where the 80-year-old lives in San Diego, California with his wife of more than five decades, Stella. I knock on the door and meet his children - Emily, 48, and Ashley, 44 - who have spent the last two weeks at their father’s side. Wayne sits in a reclining chair where he spends most of his days. Terminally ill, he is too weak to leave the house. He has invited BBC News to witness his death under California’s assisted dying laws - if MPs in London vote to legalise the practice in England and Wales, it will allow some terminally ill people here to die in a similar way. Warning: This article contains details and descriptions some readers may find disturbing Half an hour after arriving at Wayne’s house, I watch him swallow three anti-nausea tablets, designed to minimise the risk of him vomiting the lethal medication he plans to take shortly. Are you sure this day is your last, I ask him? “I’m all in,” he replies. “I was determined and decided weeks ago - I’ve had no trepidation since then. ” His family ask for one last photo, which I take, and you can see at the top of this page. As usual, Stella and Wayne are holding hands. Shortly after, Dr Donnie Moore arrives. He has got to know the family over the past few weeks, visiting them on several occasions alongside running his own end-of-life clinic. Under California law, he is what is known as the attending physician who must confirm, in addition to a second doctor, that Wayne is eligible for aid in dying. Dr Moore’s role is part physician, part counsellor in this situation, one he has been in for 150 assisted deaths before. On a top shelf in Wayne’s bedroom sits a brown glass bottle containing a fine white powder - a mixture of five drugs, sedatives and painkillers, delivered to the house four weeks before. The dosage of drugs inside is hundreds of times higher than those used in regular healthcare and is “guaranteed” to be fatal, Dr Moore explains. Unlike California, the proposed law at Westminster would require a doctor to bring any such medication with them. When Wayne signals he is ready, the doctor mixes the meds with cherry and pineapple juice to soften the bitter taste - and he hands this pink liquid to Wayne. No one, not even the doctor, knows how long it will take him to die after taking the lethal drugs. Dr Moore explains to me that, in his experience, death usually occurs between 30 minutes and two hours of ingestion, but on one occasion it took 17 hours. This is the story of how and why Wayne chose to die. And why others have decided not to follow the same course. We first met the couple a few weeks earlier, when Wayne explained why he was going ahead with the decision to have an assisted death - a controversial measure in other parts of the world. “Some days the pain is almost more than I can handle,” he said. “I just don’t see any merit to dying slow and painfully, hooked up with stuff - intubation, feeding tubes,” he told me. “I want none of it. ” Wayne said he had watched two relatives die “miserable”, “heinous” deaths from heart failure. “I hate hospitals, they are miserable. I will die in the street first. ” Wayne met Stella in 1969; the couple married four years later. He told us it was something of an arranged marriage, as his mother kept inviting Stella for dinner until eventually the penny dropped that he should take her out. They lived for many years in Arcata, northern California, surrounded by sweeping forests of redwood trees, where Wayne worked as a landscape architect, while Stella was a primary school teacher. They spent their holidays hiking and camping with their children. Now Wayne is terminally ill with heart failure, which has already brought him close to death. He has myriad other health issues including prostate cancer, liver failure and sepsis which brings him serious spinal pain. He is expected to live less than six months, qualifying him for an assisted death in California. His request to die has been approved by two doctors and the lethal medication is self-administered. It was during our first meeting that he asked the BBC to return to observe his final day, saying he wanted terminally ill adults in the UK to have the same right to an assisted death as him. “Britain is pretty good with freedoms and this is just another one,” he said. “People should be able to choose the time of their death as long as they meet the rules like six months to live or less. ” Stella, 78, supports his decision. “I’ve known him for over 50 years. He’s a very independent man. He’s always known what he wants to do and he’s always fixed things. That’s how he’s operating now. If this is his choice, I definitely agree, and I’ve seen him really suffer with the illness he’s got. I don’t want that for him. ” Wayne would also qualify under the proposed new assisted dying law in England and Wales. The measures return to the House of Commons later this month, when all MPs will have a chance to debate and vote on changes to the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill. The proposed legislation, tabled by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, says that anyone who wants to end their life must have the mental capacity to make the choice, that they must be expected to die within six months, and must make two separate declarations - witnessed and signed - about their wish to die. They must satisfy two independent doctors that they are eligible. MPs in Westminster voted in favour of assisted dying in principle last November but remain bitterly divided on the issue. If they ultimately decide to approve the bill, it could become law within the next year and come into practice within the next four years. A list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line There are also divisions here in California, where assisted dying was introduced in 2016. Michelle and Mike Carter, both 72 and married for 43 years, are each being treated for cancer - Mike has prostate cancer that has spread to his lymph nodes, and Michelle’s advanced terminal ovarian cancer has spread throughout much of her body. “I held my mother’s hand when she passed; I held my father’s hand when he passed,” Michelle told me. “I believe there’s freedom of choice however for me, I choose palliative care… I have God and I have good medicine. ” Michelle’s physician, palliative care specialist Dr Vincent Nguyen, argued that assisted dying laws in the US state lead to “silent coercion” whereby vulnerable people think their only option is to die. “Instead of ending people’s lives, let’s put programmes together to care for people,” he said. “Let them know that they’re loved, they’re wanted and they’re worthy. ” He said the law meant that doctors have gone from being seen as healers to killers, while the message from the healthcare system was that “you are better off dead, because you’re expensive and your death is cheaper for us”. Some disability campaigners say assisted dying makes them feel unsafe. Ingrid Tischer, who has muscular dystrophy and chronic respiratory failure, told me: “The message that it sends to people with disabilities in California is that you deserve suicide assistance rather than suicide prevention when you voice a desire to end your life. “What does that say about who we are as a culture?” Critics often say that once assisted dying is legalised, over time the safeguards around such laws get eroded as part of a “slippery slope” towards more relaxed criteria. In California, there was initially a mandatory 15-day cooling off period between patients making a first and second request for aid in dying. That has been reduced to 48 hours because many patients were dying during the waiting period. It’s thought the approval process envisaged in Westminster would take around a month. Outside Wayne’s house on the morning of his death, a solitary bird begins its loud and elaborate song. “There’s that mockingbird out there,” Wayne tells Stella, as smiles flicker across their faces. Wayne hates the bird because it keeps him awake at night, Stella jokes, hand in hand with him to one side of his chair. Emily and Ashley are next to Stella. Dr Moore, seated on Wayne’s other side, hands him the pink liquid which he swallows without hesitation. “Goodnight,” he says to his family - a typical touch of humour from a man who told us he was determined to die on his terms. It’s 11. 47am. After two minutes, Wayne says he is getting sleepy. Dr Moore asks him to imagine he is walking in a vast sea of flowers with a soft breeze on his skin, which seems appropriate for a patient who has spent much of his life among nature. After three minutes Wayne enters a deep sleep from which he will never wake. On a few occasions he lifts his head to take a deep breath without opening his eyes, at one point beginning to snore softly. Dr Moore tells the family this is “the deepest sleep imaginable” and reassures Emily there is no chance her dad will wake up and ask, “did it work?” “Oh that would be just like him,” Stella says with a laugh. The family start to reminisce about hiking holidays and driving around in a large van they converted to become a camper. “Me and dad insulated it and put a bed in the back,” says Ashley. On the walls are photos of Emily and Ashley as small children next to huge carved Halloween pumpkins. Dr Moore is still stroking Wayne’s hand and occasionally checking his pulse. For a man who Emily says was “always walking, always outdoors, always active”, these are the final moments of life’s journey, spent surrounded by those who mean most to him. At 12. 22pm Dr Moore says, “I think he’s passed… He’s at peace now. ” Outside, the mockingbird has fallen silent. “No more pain,” says Stella, embracing her children in her arms. I step outside to give the family some space, and reflect on what we have just seen and filmed. I have been covering medical ethics for the BBC for more than 20 years. In 2006, I was present just outside an apartment in Zurich where Dr Anne Turner, a retired doctor, died with the help of the group Dignitas - but California was the first time I had been an eyewitness to an assisted death. This isn’t just a story about one man’s death in California - it’s about what could become a reality here in England and Wales for those who qualify for an assisted death and choose to die this way. Whether you’re for or against the proposed new Westminster law, the death of a loved one is a deeply personal and emotional time for a family. Each death leaves an imprint, as will Wayne’s.

    "title": "New: Morning-after pill to be made free at pharmacies in England",
    "body": "2025/03/30 - It has been recently reported that Women across England will be able to get the morning-after pill for free from pharmacies from later this year, the government has said. Emergency contraception is already free of charge from most GPs and sexual health clinics. But ministers say getting it in pharmacies is a “postcode lottery” - with some councils funding free prescriptions, while elsewhere women can pay up to £30. It is hoped the move will free up GP appointments and reduce the inequalities faced by women trying to access the medication in disadvantaged communities. Emergency contraception is medication designed to prevent unwanted pregnancies. It usually has to be taken within 3 to 5 days of having unprotected sex but the sooner it is taken, the more effective it is. Making the morning-after pill available through the NHS at pharmacies will end the “unfair” barriers some women face when needing to access it, according to the government. Health minister Stephen Kinnock said equal access “to safe and effective contraception is crucial to women’s healthcare and a cornerstone of a fair society”. “Women across England face an unfair postcode lottery when seeking emergency contraception, with access varying dramatically depending on where they live,” he said. Kinnock said the plan “will ensure all women can access this essential healthcare when they need it, regardless of where they live or their ability to pay”. The initiative will be announced on Monday as part of a wider package of investment to rebuild the community pharmacies sector. The National Pharmacy Association welcomed the move, adding it represented “good news for patients and pharmacies alike”. But it added it was important the NHS “fully reimburses” pharmacies for time taken to conduct consultations required before pills can be dispensed. Free emergency contraception is set to be available from pharmacies in England later this year. "

    "title": "Update: Are my braids doing more harm than good?",
    "body": "2025/03/30 - Here’s what you need to know: Braids are one of the most popular hairstyles for black women, worn by celebrities and aunties alike - but questions are being raised about its effects on our health. The process can last up to five hours as stylists deftly part small, evenly-spaced sections of hair, and gradually add in extensions. Despite the long salon visits, braids have always been closely linked to convenience for me. Growing up, they were for holidays, as the style meant that instead of fretting over how frizzy my hair would get, I could jump in the pool with no worries. Braids are still what I turn to now when I want a few months break from all the detangling - or I want to try a new colour without the potential damage of hair dye. But a new study suggests that the synthetic hair many black women use to achieve this style could be bad for their health. The US non-profit organisation Consumer Reports tested samples from ten of the most popular brands of synthetic braiding hair, and found that all of them contained carcinogens, and in some cases, lead. The research made an impact, as my Instagram feed and WhatsApp groups were flooded with links to the study, warning of the alleged risks hidden in our hair. One of the messages was from my cousin, Rochelle, who does her braids herself every other month. “Braids, famously, are called a protective style,” she later told me. It’s a term typically used to describe several Afro hairstyles, including braids, locs and wigs, that reduce how much your hair is exposed to the elements and cut back on constant styling. “The fact that this style is doing everything but protect us - it’s actually harming us - is actually quite wild to me. ” It is the lack of awareness among black women that is most concerning, she adds. “People that are eating unhealthy food or smoking, they know that what they’re doing could harm their body, whereas if you’re putting braids in your hair, you’re not thinking that it’s harming you. ” James Rogers, the head of product safety testing at Consumer Reports, says that the results are a cause for concern because women have “constant contact” with harmful chemicals if their hair is in braids, often for months at a time. “We believe that whenever you’re exposed to harmful chemicals, that it’s cumulative - it all adds up. ” But he also emphasised that more research was needed, saying: “We’re hoping that this begins the conversation, not only at the regulatory level, but also amongst our own communities, about sharing accurate information. ” Here at Josée’s Professional Braiding Studio in north London, the study certainly isn’t putting clients off. Josée and her daughters Abigail and Naomi, who work with her in the salon, have seen interest from new customers, especially after they helped to create the wig worn by Elphaba in Wicked, one of highest-grossing movies of 2024. “People were shocked by how versatile we can be with our braiding,” Abigail tells me, adding that her mum received several messages from clients telling them how proud they were. Josée says that while the findings are “worrying”, it has been business as usual at the salon. Some of her customers, however, have been rattled by the research. It’s Kellie-Ann’s first time getting her braids done at Josée’s salon, but she has been wearing the style since she was a child. She tells me she felt betrayed after reading the study: “I think it’s awful that companies have been doing this for years to black women and I think we deserve better. ” She’s now seeking out brands free from harmful chemicals and plastic - and says many of her friends are doing the same. “A lot of women I’ve spoken to about it have agreed that biogradable would be better - it’s good for the planet as well. ” Ifeanyi has also worn braids since childhood, and says they are the easiest and most convenient style to handle while she’s busy studying at university. She argues that the study is not alarming, pointing out that people may come into contact with carcinogens every day, in certain processed foods, alcohol and tobacco. “Obviously you want be cautious - I just think that it’s not necessarily something to completely abandon the style or the hair for. ” She’s concerned that the social media posts she has seen will “scare people out of wanting to engage”, to the detriment of a critical source of income for black entrepreneurs working in the hair industry. In 2021 Treasure Tress, a UK-based beauty subscription for black hair, found that black British women spent £168m a year on hair products. Earlier research by L’Oreal suggested that black women in the UK spend six times more on their hair than white women. “I’d like to see more of a commitment to making sure that things are safer for us, rather than telling us that some of our historical, traditional practices as black women are wrong,” Ifeanyi says. For some, changing attitudes towards synthetic hair are opening up business opportunities. Tendai Moyo co-founded Ruka Hair in 2021, which specialises in extensions made from natural hair sourced from South East Asia, as well as biodegradable synthetic hair, made from collagen fibre. She tells me they have seen a “huge uptick in demand”, especially in the US, where the study was published. But she sees this as part of a wider trend, which stretches beyond concerns raised by the new research. “We launched in the pandemic, and people were like, ‘Oh, but salons are closed’, but we were selling out because people don’t stop doing their hair. ” She tells me that black women “got to experiment” more with their hair during lockdown and were more willing to try out new products. One of the biggest draws of traditional synthetic hair brands, however, is their low price, which has made experimenting with different styles and colours affordable for years. But newer brands tend to have a higher price point - Tendai tells me that Ruka’s most popular synthetic hair type costs around 2. 5 times more than several high street brands. Ifeanyi says that, as a student, brands like Ruka are out of reach for her: “To purchase the hair is equivalent to the amount it would cost you to get the hairstyle done, so you’re essentially doubling the price. ” Tendai defends this by comparing it to choosing between “fast food and healthy food”. She adds: “You can actually reuse our products if you’d like, and therefore you’re saving money in that way. ” Back at Josée’s salon, Naomi tells me that braiding is not just an important source of income, but a valued cultural practice that brings her family together. “I call myself a braid baby because I’ve been braiding since I was 6 years old,” she says, telling me how her family would bond over the skill as her mum proudly looks on. “It’s an empowering service to offer,” she adds, saying that it’s gratifying to do a job that leaves other women feeling uplifted. Despite growing concerns about the effect it could have on our health, braiding is a precious heirloom for this family - and for many other black women - passed down from generation to generation. As Ifeanyi tells me: “The form of extensions might change, but I don’t think the practice of getting braids is going anywhere. ” Photos by Emma Lynch "

It’s a term typically used to describe several Afro hairstyles, including braids, locs and wigs, that reduce how much your hair is exposed to the elements and cut back on constant styling. “The fact that this style is doing everything but protect us - it’s actually harming us - is actually quite wild to me. ” It is the lack of awareness among black women that is most concerning, she adds. “People that are eating unhealthy food or smoking, they know that what they’re doing could harm their body, whereas if you’re putting braids in your hair, you’re not thinking that it’s harming you. ” James Rogers, the head of product safety testing at Consumer Reports, says that the results are a cause for concern because women have “constant contact” with harmful chemicals if their hair is in braids, often for months at a time. “We believe that whenever you’re exposed to harmful chemicals, that it’s cumulative - it all adds up. ” But he also emphasised that more research was needed, saying: “We’re hoping that this begins the conversation, not only at the regulatory level, but also amongst our own communities, about sharing accurate information. ” Here at Josée’s Professional Braiding Studio in north London, the study certainly isn’t putting clients off. Josée and her daughters Abigail and Naomi, who work with her in the salon, have seen interest from new customers, especially after they helped to create the wig worn by Elphaba in Wicked, one of highest-grossing movies of 2024. “People were shocked by how versatile we can be with our braiding,” Abigail tells me, adding that her mum received several messages from clients telling them how proud they were. Josée says that while the findings are “worrying”, it has been business as usual at the salon. Some of her customers, however, have been rattled by the research. It’s Kellie-Ann’s first time getting her braids done at Josée’s salon, but she has been wearing the style since she was a child. She tells me she felt betrayed after reading the study: “I think it’s awful that companies have been doing this for years to black women and I think we deserve better. ” She’s now seeking out brands free from harmful chemicals and plastic - and says many of her friends are doing the same. “A lot of women I’ve spoken to about it have agreed that biogradable would be better - it’s good for the planet as well. ” Ifeanyi has also worn braids since childhood, and says they are the easiest and most convenient style to handle while she’s busy studying at university. She argues that the study is not alarming, pointing out that people may come into contact with carcinogens every day, in certain processed foods, alcohol and tobacco. “Obviously you want be cautious - I just think that it’s not necessarily something to completely abandon the style or the hair for. ” She’s concerned that the social media posts she has seen will “scare people out of wanting to engage”, to the detriment of a critical source of income for black entrepreneurs working in the hair industry. In 2021 Treasure Tress, a UK-based beauty subscription for black hair, found that black British women spent £168m a year on hair products. Earlier research by L’Oreal suggested that black women in the UK spend six times more on their hair than white women. “I’d like to see more of a commitment to making sure that things are safer for us, rather than telling us that some of our historical, traditional practices as black women are wrong,” Ifeanyi says. For some, changing attitudes towards synthetic hair are opening up business opportunities. Tendai Moyo co-founded Ruka Hair in 2021, which specialises in extensions made from natural hair sourced from South East Asia, as well as biodegradable synthetic hair, made from collagen fibre. She tells me they have seen a “huge uptick in demand”, especially in the US, where the study was published. But she sees this as part of a wider trend, which stretches beyond concerns raised by the new research. “We launched in the pandemic, and people were like, ‘Oh, but salons are closed’, but we were selling out because people don’t stop doing their hair. ” She tells me that black women “got to experiment” more with their hair during lockdown and were more willing to try out new products. One of the biggest draws of traditional synthetic hair brands, however, is their low price, which has made experimenting with different styles and colours affordable for years. But newer brands tend to have a higher price point - Tendai tells me that Ruka’s most popular synthetic hair type costs around 2. 5 times more than several high street brands. Ifeanyi says that, as a student, brands like Ruka are out of reach for her: “To purchase the hair is equivalent to the amount it would cost you to get the hairstyle done, so you’re essentially doubling the price. ” Tendai defends this by comparing it to choosing between “fast food and healthy food”. She adds: “You can actually reuse our products if you’d like, and therefore you’re saving money in that way. ” Back at Josée’s salon, Naomi tells me that braiding is not just an important source of income, but a valued cultural practice that brings her family together. “I call myself a braid baby because I’ve been braiding since I was 6 years old,” she says, telling me how her family would bond over the skill as her mum proudly looks on. “It’s an empowering service to offer,” she adds, saying that it’s gratifying to do a job that leaves other women feeling uplifted. Despite growing concerns about the effect it could have on our health, braiding is a precious heirloom for this family - and for many other black women - passed down from generation to generation. As Ifeanyi tells me: “The form of extensions might change, but I don’t think the practice of getting braids is going anywhere. ” Photos by Emma Lynch "

    "body": "2025/03/29 - According to new developments, Victims of infected blood are dying “two a week” while awaiting compensation for the biggest scandal in the history of the NHS, campaigners say. More than 30,000 people in the UK were given treatments infected with HIV and Hepatitis C between the late 1970s and early 1990s, resulting in more than 3,000 deaths. Tony Summers, 89, whose son died after being given infected blood products, said he was told he may not receive compensation until 2029 and fears he might be dead before then. A Labour MP described the delay as “embarrassing”, while the Infected Blood Compensation Authority (IBCA) said its priority was to pay compensation to “as many people as soon as possible”. In May 2024, a public inquiry found the authorities had covered up the scale of what is now known as the infected blood scandal. In response, the UK government set aside £11. 8bn to compensate the victims - including parents, children and siblings - of which there could be as many as 140,000. But many victims, charities and the inquiry’s chair, Sir Brian Langstaff, have expressed concern about the way compensation is being implemented and the time it is taking. Forty people have accepted offers of compensation so far according to the IBCA. Mr Summers’ son Paul was diagnosed with HIV and Hepatitis C after being given a blood clotting product used to treat haemophilia. He died in 2008 at the age of 44. “I just feel so proud of what [Paul] achieved, because he had so much to offer,” said Mr Summers, from Llantwit Major in the Vale of Glamorgan. “I would like to feel that everything we started in 1984, which has been a long journey, we won’t have lost it. “We will have achieved and that will give me more satisfaction than anything. Just to feel that we did the right thing. “It’s probably the most important thing in my life to get to the end of this, to get closure. I just want this to be over. ” Mr Summers claims to have been told he may not receive compensation until 2029 – five years after the inquiry’s final report was published. “By then I’ll be 93, you begin to have doubts,” he said. “People are still dying from any affected illnesses. Parents are dying. So it feels as though there’s a policy [of] ‘if we hang on long enough we won’t have to pay that money’. ” Lynne Kelly, chair of Haemophilia Wales, said people wanted closure after campaigning for more than four decades. “People are dying two a week at the moment, so we’re in a really difficult position,” she said. “They’re delaying and delaying because more and more people are dying. “The infected are dying, and when the affected die their claim dies with them so there’s no claim to be made and bit by bit, less and less people will be eligible for compensation and less money will be paid. “They’ve been ignored for 40 years, they’ve campaigned for 40 years. We feel history is repeating itself. It’s heart-breaking. ” The IBCA is administering payments, which are exempt from tax and will not affect benefits. A person infected with HIV could expect to get compensation of between £2. 2m and £2. 6m. Those with a chronic hepatitis C infection, defined as lasting more than six months, could expect to receive between £665,000 and £810,000. The partner of someone infected with HIV who is still alive today could expect to receive about £110,000. Around 4,000 survivors or their bereaved families have also received interim payments worth up to £310,000 since 2022. Labour MP Clive Efford, the Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Haemophilia and Contaminated Blood, said the situation had become “an embarrassing issue for the government”. “We owe it to these people to get this compensation out the door as quickly as possible because they’ve been suffering as a consequence of this for many, many years, they’ve been forced to take on the state. ” David Foley, Interim Chief Executive of the IBCA, said its priority was to pay “as many people as soon as possible as we design and build a compensation claim service”. Mr Foley said the IBCA had now contacted more than 250 people but he said they were “acutely aware there are many more awaiting compensation”. “We will continue to increase the number of compensation payments made as we build the claims service further,” he added. “We are committed to making payments to the majority of infected people by 2027 and the majority of affected people by 2029 - making these payments faster than this wherever possible. ” "

    "body": "2025/03/28 - Here’s what you need to know: Jay Springett, a tech strategist and podcast host, joined the social media app Butterflies AI out of curiosity, and ended up staying for more than six months. The idea of Butterflies is to allow human and AI personas to interact. Mr Springett’s online persona developed over time, interacting with other artificial characters, and even went as far as to start its own Beanie Babies [a line of soft toys] collection. He said it was like AIs were writing their own soap operas inside a simulation. “I didn’t engage with Butterflies in the same way I do with other platforms,” Mr Springett told BBC. “It felt more like observing than participating. I wouldn’t pay for it, but it was interesting enough to keep watching. ” A host of social media services, like Butterflies, are trying to expand at a time when there is dissatisfaction with the social media giants. According to data from Similarweb, a digital market intelligence company, X’s daily active users in the UK have dropped by nearly 25% since January 2024. And it’s not just X that has been suffering, mobile and desktop traffic to Facebook has declined over the last few years according to Similarweb. A report by the Pew Research Centre found that a third of teens use Facebook and X, compared with three quarters a decade ago. Bluesky is one of the social media firms gaining ground. Over the past year, Bluesky has gained tens of millions of new users, often at the expense of X. Apart from just timing, though, BlueSky’s success can be largely attributed to its novel architecture, which pairs an X-like experience with a high degree of customization. Unlike centralized systems, where social media companies have complete control over content and identities, Bluesky users can choose how their feeds are moderated, and what kind of posts the algorithm recommends to them, thanks to the hundreds of options offered by both Bluesky and the community. Don’t like the broader discourse on Bluesky? Jump on the “popular with friends” feed to see what the people you follow specifically are talking about. It will not be simple for Bluesky to scale up to the size of X and Facebook, says Andy Tattersall, an information specialist at the University of Sheffield. He ways it will have to strike a balance between “generating revenue, keeping users safe, and moderating content, which is much easier said than done”. Celebrity-backed foundation, Free Our Feeds, hopes to do that. It’s backed some notable names, including musician Brian Eno and actor Mark Ruffalo, and plans to raise $30m (£23m) over the next three years to support an open social media ecosystem powered by the AT Protocol, the decentralized network powering Bluesky. “Bluesky has created a strong foundation for shared social media infrastructure,” says Robin Berjon, one of Free Our Feeds’ nine custodians, “but so long as they are the primary operator of this infrastructure the risk remains that it will stop operating in the public interest”. A bigger worry for these emerging platforms, though, is the network barrier. This can be summed up with Metcalfe’s Law, explains Evan Prodromou, co-author and current editor of ActivityPub, another open social media architecture, which is behind popular platforms like Meta’s Threads. The law states that the value of a network goes up with the square of the number of users. That means that bigger social networks have way more resources than smaller ones. They can use those resources to get bigger and bigger and crowd out smaller social media services. Non-profits like Free Our Feeds and the Social Web Foundation, which Mr Prodromou heads, have a strategy that they hope will help them overcome that Metcalfe’s Law. They hope to replace the current situation, where users of social media hop between their favourite services. Instead Social Web Foundation is developing a platform which can offer content from all of them. Threads for example supports a protocol called ActivityPub, which makes it easier to combine services with other social media firms that use that protocol - like Mastodon for instance. Using this kind of interoperability, Mr Prodromou hopes that services like Social Web Foundation will provide the same value as giant, monolithic platforms. It’s not straightforward, as not all social media firms support the same protocol, for example, BlueSky uses the AT Protocol. But there are workarounds to that problem, and Free Our Feeds and Social Web Foundation are also working on ways to aggregate sites that use different tech. “One thing we’ve learnt from the past decades is that the last thing the world needs is a one-size-fits all solution for eight billion people,” says Mr Berjon. At the other end of the spectrum are those that want to carve a niche out for themselves, rather than replace the incumbents. In the last couple of years, a cottage industry of unique, new social apps has cropped. One of those is Mozi, created by Twitter co-founder Ev Williams. Mozi doesn’t want you to socialise online at all. Instead it informs you when you’re going to be in the same place (city or event) as someone you know and encourages you to connect with people more often in person. “Until Mozi, no combination of apps could tell me what city my friends are in at any given time, or even what my friends locally are up to,” says Mozi co-founder, Molly DeWolf Swenson. Mike McCue, the CEO of Flipboard, is convinced such innovation will result in a new era of social networking, where numerous new, more interesting types of social networks will emerge and offer people more choices. He hopes that Flipboard’s app, Surf will help people manage a messy social media ecosystem. It allows users to browse from a centralized feed that can draw posts and content from a variety of platforms, including Threads, Bluesky, and YouTube. “In the end,” says Mr McCue, “it’s unlikely one service will replace the Facebook or Twitter we once knew, but instead several services will start to take our time away from these old-style single feed experiences, our behaviours will shift with these new choices and new generations will expect more. ” "

    "body": "2025/03/28 - Experts revealed that Jay Springett, a tech strategist and podcast host, joined the social media app Butterflies AI out of curiosity, and ended up staying for more than six months. The idea of Butterflies is to allow human and AI personas to interact. Mr Springett’s online persona developed over time, interacting with other artificial characters, and even went as far as to start its own Beanie Babies [a line of soft toys] collection. He said it was like AIs were writing their own soap operas inside a simulation. “I didn’t engage with Butterflies in the same way I do with other platforms,” Mr Springett told BBC. “It felt more like observing than participating. I wouldn’t pay for it, but it was interesting enough to keep watching. ” A host of social media services, like Butterflies, are trying to expand at a time when there is dissatisfaction with the social media giants. According to data from Similarweb, a digital market intelligence company, X’s daily active users in the UK have dropped by nearly 25% since January 2024. And it’s not just X that has been suffering, mobile and desktop traffic to Facebook has declined over the last few years according to Similarweb. A report by the Pew Research Centre found that a third of teens use Facebook and X, compared with three quarters a decade ago. Bluesky is one of the social media firms gaining ground. Over the past year, Bluesky has gained tens of millions of new users, often at the expense of X. Apart from just timing, though, BlueSky’s success can be largely attributed to its novel architecture, which pairs an X-like experience with a high degree of customization. Unlike centralized systems, where social media companies have complete control over content and identities, Bluesky users can choose how their feeds are moderated, and what kind of posts the algorithm recommends to them, thanks to the hundreds of options offered by both Bluesky and the community. Don’t like the broader discourse on Bluesky? Jump on the “popular with friends” feed to see what the people you follow specifically are talking about. It will not be simple for Bluesky to scale up to the size of X and Facebook, says Andy Tattersall, an information specialist at the University of Sheffield. He ways it will have to strike a balance between “generating revenue, keeping users safe, and moderating content, which is much easier said than done”. Celebrity-backed foundation, Free Our Feeds, hopes to do that. It’s backed some notable names, including musician Brian Eno and actor Mark Ruffalo, and plans to raise $30m (£23m) over the next three years to support an open social media ecosystem powered by the AT Protocol, the decentralized network powering Bluesky. “Bluesky has created a strong foundation for shared social media infrastructure,” says Robin Berjon, one of Free Our Feeds’ nine custodians, “but so long as they are the primary operator of this infrastructure the risk remains that it will stop operating in the public interest”. A bigger worry for these emerging platforms, though, is the network barrier. This can be summed up with Metcalfe’s Law, explains Evan Prodromou, co-author and current editor of ActivityPub, another open social media architecture, which is behind popular platforms like Meta’s Threads. The law states that the value of a network goes up with the square of the number of users. That means that bigger social networks have way more resources than smaller ones. They can use those resources to get bigger and bigger and crowd out smaller social media services. Non-profits like Free Our Feeds and the Social Web Foundation, which Mr Prodromou heads, have a strategy that they hope will help them overcome that Metcalfe’s Law. They hope to replace the current situation, where users of social media hop between their favourite services. Instead Social Web Foundation is developing a platform which can offer content from all of them. Threads for example supports a protocol called ActivityPub, which makes it easier to combine services with other social media firms that use that protocol - like Mastodon for instance. Using this kind of interoperability, Mr Prodromou hopes that services like Social Web Foundation will provide the same value as giant, monolithic platforms. It’s not straightforward, as not all social media firms support the same protocol, for example, BlueSky uses the AT Protocol. But there are workarounds to that problem, and Free Our Feeds and Social Web Foundation are also working on ways to aggregate sites that use different tech. “One thing we’ve learnt from the past decades is that the last thing the world needs is a one-size-fits all solution for eight billion people,” says Mr Berjon. At the other end of the spectrum are those that want to carve a niche out for themselves, rather than replace the incumbents. In the last couple of years, a cottage industry of unique, new social apps has cropped. One of those is Mozi, created by Twitter co-founder Ev Williams. Mozi doesn’t want you to socialise online at all. Instead it informs you when you’re going to be in the same place (city or event) as someone you know and encourages you to connect with people more often in person. “Until Mozi, no combination of apps could tell me what city my friends are in at any given time, or even what my friends locally are up to,” says Mozi co-founder, Molly DeWolf Swenson. Mike McCue, the CEO of Flipboard, is convinced such innovation will result in a new era of social networking, where numerous new, more interesting types of social networks will emerge and offer people more choices. He hopes that Flipboard’s app, Surf will help people manage a messy social media ecosystem. It allows users to browse from a centralized feed that can draw posts and content from a variety of platforms, including Threads, Bluesky, and YouTube. “In the end,” says Mr McCue, “it’s unlikely one service will replace the Facebook or Twitter we once knew, but instead several services will start to take our time away from these old-style single feed experiences, our behaviours will shift with these new choices and new generations will expect more. ” "

    "title": "Update: David Dimbleby - I thought the free market was with us forever - then Trump came along",
    "body": "2025/03/28 - Experts revealed that I remember 1974 well. With inflation on the rise, the government had been locked in battle with trade unions over worker pay. The government appeared paralysed: stand up to the miners and strikes could shut down the power system, but give in and pay them more money and inflation would rocket. And then the global oil crisis came out of nowhere. It threw economies, including Britain’s, into chaos. The government introduced a three-day week. Power cuts were common - we would be plunged into darkness without warning. And seemingly, the government just expected us to deal with it. This was also the year I began presenting the BBC’s current affairs programme Panorama. We spent a lot of time debating these issues. People came on with all kinds of different ideas of what to do. There were even suggestions that what the country really needed to take back control from the unions was a military takeover - a coup. There was another idea out there too. It was proposed by the Conservative politician Keith Joseph and was entirely radical - so removed from the mainstream, in fact, that during filming of Panorama, Joseph turned to the production team and asked exasperatedly if they understood what he meant. That idea was the free market. This meant Britain departing from the post World War Two consensus that government should control the economy and that instead if you left the markets alone, they would deliver the country greater prosperity and security. If, in 2025, the idea sounds anything but radical, that’s exactly the point. What we saw in the UK in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher’s government was just how quickly the free market transitioned from a radical idea into the new reality. Then before long it became what many assumed was the system that would last forever. US President Donald Trump is a billionaire businessman who has clearly done well financially out of capitalism. But suddenly, thanks in part to him, the free market system finds itself under assault like never before. It might yet weather the storm. However others are asking, is the free market system fatally flawed and doomed to failure? So much of what Thatcher did in the wake of her 1983 general election victory seems so obvious now. We take it for granted that private companies play a pivotal role in providing our water, electricity, gas, railways, ports and freight. But at the time few believed it possible to do what she had done - it seemed like a fantasy world, completely detached from how things had been done post war. I was six when the war ended. There was rationing – coupons that allowed you to buy meat or clothes, or of course, sweets. But out of these hard times and on the heels of victory, a new vision of society was emerging in Britain. With Clement Attlee’s landslide election victory in July 1945, for the first time in Britain’s political history a majority cast their votes for a party ostensibly dedicated to socialism. But more than that, a new consensus on how the country should run emerged, with those leading the Labour and Conservative parties singing from a broadly similar sheet. “We have built our defences against want and sickness, and we’re proud of it,” was uttered not by a Labour prime minister but by Harold Macmillan, Conservative prime minister from 1957 to 1963. This had been how things were done. However not everyone bought into the consensus. Antony Fisher, who was a chicken farmer, was exasperated by what he saw as the meddling of the Egg Marketing Board. He set up the Institute of Economic Affairs think tank, inspired Keith Joseph and he in turn got Thatcher’s ear. That the current assault on the free market is coming, in part, from a Republican US president seems all the more ironic given how popular Thatcher’s reforms were with the American right. Thatcher and President Ronald Reagan shared a similar world view, and Trump has spoken of his admiration for the two, albeit with the caveat that he didn’t agree with some of Reagan’s trade policies. Thatcher was convinced that the country would be much better off if gas and water and electricity were taken out of the hands of the state. And sold on the open market. The free market. Just like buying a loaf of bread. The Thatcher government’s big idea was that they weren’t just going to sell the shares in state-owned utilities to big businesses or investors. They were going to offer them to the British people. In December 1984 shares in British Telecom (BT) went on sale. The next morning, the numbers were staggering: more than two million Britons were now BT shareholders. And Thatcher began to realise that selling off these companies wasn’t just about breaking the shackles of government control. It could be something bigger - turning every person in Britain into a capitalist and in doing so making capitalism popular. In Britain, by the end of the 1980s, the scale of transformation was staggering. The sum of £60bn was raised by selling off state run companies. Up to 15 million Britons were now shareholders. Britain was embracing the free market. This wasn’t just an economic shift. It was a cultural revolution. A redefinition of Britain’s relationship with money, with government, and with itself. And if Thatcher’s privatisation had given ordinary people the chance to buy shares, her reforms to Britain’s financial services sector in 1986, known as the Big Bang, gave ordinary people the chance to sell them too, to get a job in the previously closed world of the City. There were many on the left for whom the principle alone of these reforms was something to object to. The assault on the free market from some on the right is not about the principles of the reforms, but the consequences. At the core of Thatcher’s thinking was a belief that free market capitalism could work only if many people had a direct stake in it. And with share ownership of previously state run utilities, many people did. But before long, alarm bells were starting to be rung. And their chime has only gotten louder. James Goldsmith was a businessman who had made a fortune by buying struggling companies cheaply, reshaping them to maximise efficiency and then selling them at a profit. The 1980s reforms were like manna from heaven for him. But then he seemed to change his mind about things. In 1994 he told a committee of US senators that its premise contained a fatal flaw - that the system demanded maximum profit but to achieve maximum profit that meant severing the umbilical link with many of your own electorate. “You get to a system whereby, to get the best corporate profits, you have to leave your own country. You have to say to your own sales force ‘Goodbye, we can’t use you anymore - you’re too expensive’. “You’ve got unions. You want holidays. You want protection. So we’re going offshore. ” Goldsmith was predicting that companies would take their business wherever they would make the most money. If you are a CEO answerable to shareholders that’s literally your job description. And the result, he said, would be job losses in the West, with communities collapsing. And to make things worse, he argued that Britain had ceded sovereignty to the likes of the European Union and the World Trade Organization, with Britain binding itself to an economic system run by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels, only adding to the sense of alienation felt in collapsing communities. And with global markets dictating policy. If an industry wasn’t profitable, it was left to die. Today, the UK may be a global leader in science and financial services but is that of much consolation to communities where we once made things that are now made offshore? Based on what I often heard in my many years touring the country presenting Question Time, I’m not sure it is. Goldsmith would end up trying to go into politics. His Referendum Party was trounced in the 1997 general election but he had planted a seed. He had argued that the global free market path that Britain and the rest of the world was going down was dangerous. That it would spread division around the world. Fast-forward nearly 20 years to 2016 and his warning came to pass. Britain voted to leave the European Union and the verdict could not be clearer: the Leave vote was highest in those left-behind communities, seemingly fuelled by those who felt globalisation was not working for them. The dream of a nation of shareholders has soured too. In 1989 Thames Water was privatised. We were promised lower bills, better infrastructure, less red tape and investment in a system fraying at the edges. It was investment that the global capitalist system was supposedly best placed to provide. What followed was something else entirely. Debt ballooned and dividends flowed to shareholders. The company extracted profit while pipes leaked and sewage poured into rivers. And our bills now pay for interest on that debt - it feels like we’ve come a long way from Thatcher’s nation of shareholders. Back in 1994, James Goldsmith had posited that the problem with the free market dream was that it didn’t protect the home base. Now, there is someone else much more powerful who takes that view. President Trump’s methods are so erratic that with him it’s hard to tell what is going on. His readiness to slap hugely consequential tariffs on countries that are both traditional foes and supposed friends at times defies easy explanation. But what we can say is that he is trying to return to ideas that preceded the free market. He is trying to make America strong through protectionism, making it harder for anyone to simply sell anywhere. There is an argument that if you take the long view then perhaps the free market period is the outlier. Britain itself had a long, long period of protectionism before it embraced free trade. Tariffs are nothing new in world economic history and in a sense Trump is just trying to return the US to how things were, albeit in quite a chaotic way. The reign of the free market is facing its biggest ever challenge. But that challenge is coming not from supporters of socialism who ideologically back a big role for the state. Instead, the challenge is coming from Trump, a man who is broadly speaking of the right and has no qualms with capitalism allowing people to become very rich. That the challenge is coming from within is what makes it so potent.

    "title": "Latest: Doctor 'betrayed' over son's death at her hospital",
    "body": "2025/03/27 - According to new developments, A doctor who rushed her seriously ill son to the east London hospital where she worked, and where he later died of sepsis, says she feels “betrayed” by the way her family were treated. William Hewes, 22, died within 24 hours of being admitted to Homerton University Hospital after his meningitis developed into sepsis in January 2023. Dr Deborah Burns said she had repeatedly queried the speed of his treatment and has since been unable to “go back and work for an organisation that doesn’t acknowledge its errors and learn from them”. A coroner has criticised the hospital but said she could not conclude if earlier treatment would have saved Mr Hewes. The hospital said it would learn from what happened. Mr Hewes became unwell at about 13:30 GMT on 20 January and said he felt cold and had a headache. His condition deteriorated during the afternoon and he got up after going to bed that night to tell his mother he felt very unwell and had bruising on his belly. Suspecting meningococcal sepsis, his mother rang the hospital emergency department to warn them she and her son were on the way. While at the hospital Dr Burns – who was a specialist in paediatrics at Homerton University Hospital – said she had asked staff on eight separate occasions if they had given him antibiotics. “I wasn’t clock-watching but I knew they were not given straight away,” she said. “I thought the nurse was prioritising other things, medication to treat his symptoms.  It wasn’t medication that was going to change the outcome of what he had. ” Giving evidence during the inquest, the medical staff who treated Mr Hewes said they did not recall Dr Burns asking for antibiotics eight times. Senior coroner Mary Hassell said she accepted Dr Burns’ evidence on this point, although she believed hospital staff were not being deliberately untruthful but had not heard an instruction from the registrar to administer antibiotics and fluids, as well as medication for his symptoms. She added that Mr Hewes did not receive the antibiotics and fluids “with the urgency that he should have”. Nevertheless, while delivering a narrative verdict she said the 22-year-old was already very unwell when he arrived at the hospital and it was not clear if he would have survived had he been treated quicker. Following her son’s death, Dr Burns was told that Homerton University Hospital was going to investigate what happened. But months later she learned they had decided against an inquiry, as “there were no delays, there weren’t any concerns about his treatment”. She told the BBC she “couldn’t understand why no investigation had been done… and also why I hadn’t been informed of the outcome”. Dr Burns added she had been unable to return to work as she had planned, due to the way she says the hospital has treated her family since her son’s death. “I am now much more aware of the deeply ingrained, defensive culture within the NHS. I trusted them, I felt betrayed,” she said. “It has been totally unnecessary. If it can happen to me, then I really worry for the general population. ” She now has a diagnosis of complex grief. “I haven’t been able to walk away from this in the last two years,” she explained. “And it’s all deeply meshed with the loss of my very much adored youngest son. ” The coroner said she would issue a prevention of future deaths report to Homerton University Hospital, calling on it to share the changes it had made since Mr Hewes’ death. Solicitor Deborah Nadel, who represented Dr Burns during the inquest, said: “The coroner has made it very clear yet again how concerned she is about catastrophic errors in sepsis care. “How many more times must a coroner flag their concerns about hospital practices around sepsis, and how many more times must a lawyer flag the terrible impact on families for things to change?” A spokesperson for Homerton Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust said Dr Burns had “told us that our policies and processes for this situation are inadequate and detached and we are determined to learn from her experience. “This work will ensure a more personal response for staff members or members of their family who are patients here. ” The trust added an action plan had been drawn up after Mr Hewes’ death, with changes introduced including making sure an intensive care doctor attends the bedside of a patient with suspected sepsis and delivering further training on recognising sepsis symptoms. Symptoms include: If you think you or someone you look after has symptoms of sepsis, call 999 or go to A&amp;E.

    "body": "2025/03/27 - It has been recently reported that A doctor who rushed her seriously ill son to the east London hospital where she worked, and where he later died of sepsis, says she feels “betrayed” by the way her family were treated. William Hewes, 22, died within 24 hours of being admitted to Homerton University Hospital after his meningitis developed into sepsis in January 2023. Dr Deborah Burns said she had repeatedly queried the speed of his treatment and has since been unable to “go back and work for an organisation that doesn’t acknowledge its errors and learn from them”. A coroner has criticised the hospital but said she could not conclude if earlier treatment would have saved Mr Hewes. The hospital said it would learn from what happened.

    "title": "Latest: Fake £4m Xanax drug gang boss jailed",
    "body": "2025/03/27 - Experts revealed that A gang leader who co-ordinated a £4m fake Xanax drug-making operation in sheds and garages across the West Midlands has been jailed for eight years. Up to 11 million tablets were made in various locations in Tipton, Wednesbury and Wolverhampton and then sold on the dark web via cryptocurrency payments. The criminal enterprise, between 2018 and 2019, was run from a luxury villa in Thailand by Brian Pitts, 30, who is one of 10 being sentenced for their part in the operation. The fake tablets were shipped across the UK and to the USA, Wolverhampton Crown Court heard. Tests revealed the amount of the active ingredient Alprazalam in the fake tablets varied from none at all to twice the proper amount. Pitts, who had earlier pleaded guilty to six charges, including conspiracy to supply Class C drugs, was described by Judge John Butterfield as “the beating heart of this enterprise”. He said the ringleader controlled every part of the drugs operation and was constantly involved in it. Pitts, of Beebee Road in Wednesbury, was arrested by police when he returned to the UK with his then-partner Katie Harlow, who was also part of the Thai end of the criminal operation, and Lee Lloyd. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said they were all found with “designer clothes and Rolex watches in their luggage”. The officers were able to seize Pitts’ mobile phone, which prosecutors described as a “goldmine of information”, showing his involvement at all levels of the operation. Four other members of the gang were jailed on Thursday, with five more due to be sentenced in the coming days. Harlow, 27, of Lane Street, Bilston, was sentenced to two years and one month, after she earlier admitted a charge of converting and transferring criminal property. Judge Butterfield said that while it appeared Pitts had taken some actions in her name, none of them were without her knowledge. Lee Lloyd, 48, of Shakespeare Road, Tipton, was sentenced to seven years and two months, after earlier admitting six charges, including conspiracy to supply Class C drugs. Judge Butterfield said he was “plainly a trusted right hand man to Brian Pitts” and took regular calls from him. Kyle Smith, 26, of Arundel Road, Willenhall, was jailed for four years. He had previously pleaded guilty to five charges, including conspiracy to supply Class C drugs. The court heard he had been involved in packaging, posting and record-keeping and had been “in the middle of packaging pills” when police visited him. Mark Bayley, 63, of Jeremy Road, Wolverhampton, was sentenced to six years and five months. He also previously pleaded guilty to five charges, including conspiracy to supply Class C drugs and possession with intent to supply Class B drugs. Police found a pill-making machine in operation at his address and he was described as having “pre-existing expertise”. Judge Butterfield said it would be wrong to dismiss the enterprise as “a minor cottage industry” and that it was instead “large scale, organised and determined”. The gang had initially come to light after an investigation was launched by Pfizer, the manufacturer of the genuine Xanax tablets, which are used to treat anxiety. The inquiry was then picked up by the Regional Organised Crime Unit, which discovered the gang had purchased legally four pill-making machines, enabling them to press more than 16,000 tablets an hour. While the gang made £4m, the number of tablets they made could have fetched them more than £11m, the court heard. The gang also purchased the powders needed to make the tablets from China and bought fake Xanax stamps. Illicit Alprazolam can contain other unknown and potentially harmful sedative drugs, and has been linked with a number of deaths in both the UK and US when mixed with other potent drugs. The UK Health Security Agency said there was evidence use was “a growing problem, particularly among young people and young adults”. Cranstoun, a harm reduction charity in the Black Country, said counterfeit drugs were often “much more potent and stronger than the drugs they are masquerading as”. “We’re proud of the role we played alongside the authorities to ensure these serious criminals were brought to justice,” said Patrick Holt, director of global security at Pfizer. “We dedicated time, resource and expertise to ensure these illicit counterfeit activities were prevented in order to protect public health. ” Jonathan Kelleher from the CPS said it had been a case of “fake medicines being produced on an industrial scale, with significant potential harm to the public”.

    "body": "2025/03/26 - Let’s dive into the details: Childbirth charities are warning parents that hands-free breastfeeding or bottle feeding, when a baby is being carried in a sling, is unsafe. The National Childbirth Trust (NCT) and the Lullaby Trust say the risks are highest for premature babies and those under four months old because their airways can be easily blocked. Their updated guidance follows an inquest into the death of a six-week-old boy who was being breastfed in a baby carrier while his mother moved around their home. A coroner’s report to prevent future deaths like his found there was very little information on safe positioning of babies in slings or the risks of suffocation when feeding. The baby, Jimmy Alderman, from London, was being breastfed in a sling in October 2023, but was in an unsafe position too far down the sling and lost consciousness after five minutes, the coroner found. Attempts were made to resuscitate him straight away, but he died three days later. Senior coroner for west London, Lydia Brown, issued a warning about the dangers of baby slings following an inquest held last year into his death. She said there appeared to be no helpful visual images of “safe” versus “unsafe” postures for babies in slings or carriers, adding that “the NHS available literature provides no guidance or advice”. The NCT said it “immediately reviewed” its online information on baby slings and carriers after receiving the coroner’s report and hearing feedback from Jimmy’s parents. The NCT’s online advice now says: “Hands-free breastfeeding or bottle feeding, where the wearer moves around and does other jobs while the baby is feeding, is unsafe. “This is especially true for babies under four months old. It also applies to babies born prematurely or those with a health condition. ” The charity says young babies do not have strong necks and cannot lift their heads, meaning that their airway “can easily be blocked” in baby slings and carriers. It adds that a sling’s fabric or the fabric from a parent’s clothes “could cause suffocation very quickly”. “If the sling or carrier is not correctly fitted and adjusted, babies can experience traumatic head injuries,” the charity’s advice says. The NCT goes on to say that slings should be: The Lullaby Trust said it had also changed its advice to parents. If your baby needs to feed, take them out of the sling, it now warns. “We are constantly reviewing the evidence and research, as there is currently no robust evidence on how to feed hands-free safely, which is why we changed our guidance to advise against it,” said CEO Jenny Ward. The charity is helping to fund research to develop better guidance for parents and carers on the safety of baby slings and carriers. The NHS website says when using a sling or carrier, do not let the material cover your baby’s head. "

    "body": "2025/03/26 - Let’s dive into the details: Many fertility patients in the UK are being offered unnecessary add-on treatments that have little or no proof of improving the likelihood of pregnancy, a report suggests. Add-ons are optional, non-essential treatments some private clinics offer in addition to proven treatments, such in-vitro fertilisation (IVF). According to the regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) , 73% of 1,500 patients surveyed between September and October 2024 said they had used an add-on in their latest round of treatment. Most said they had done so based on the clinic’s recommendation. And only about one in every three said the possible risks had been explained to them. HFEA director Clare Ettinghausen told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “This is people themselves reporting on whether they took perhaps an additional supplement, like a vitamin tablet, or had a test or perhaps something like acupuncture. “We have looked at the evidence… they are not necessarily going to increase the chance of having a baby. “So we are worried that people are spending money unnecessarily. ” Some of the add-ons can cost thousands of pounds. And while the HFEA has no power to stop or fine clinics, it is reminding them they must give patients a clear idea of what add-ons involve, how likely they are to help and how much they cost. The regulator also has its own traffic-light rating tool to help patients decide. Examples include: Overall, patients were satisfied with the care they were receiving, Ms Ettinghausen said. But the HFEA is concerned NHS patients are waiting longer than those going private. Just over one out of every two private patients started treatment within a year, compared with one out of every three NHS patients. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “It is unacceptable fertility patients are being offered unnecessary treatments that will not help them in their goal of becoming parents. “We are working to improve access to NHS fertility services for all who need it. “We are also currently considering advice from the HFEA about priorities for law reform covering their regulatory powers, including their potential role in digital clinics. ” "

HFEA director Clare Ettinghausen told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “This is people themselves reporting on whether they took perhaps an additional supplement, like a vitamin tablet, or had a test or perhaps something like acupuncture. “We have looked at the evidence… they are not necessarily going to increase the chance of having a baby. “So we are worried that people are spending money unnecessarily. ” Some of the add-ons can cost thousands of pounds. And while the HFEA has no power to stop or fine clinics, it is reminding them they must give patients a clear idea of what add-ons involve, how likely they are to help and how much they cost. The regulator also has its own traffic-light rating tool to help patients decide. Examples include: Overall, patients were satisfied with the care they were receiving, Ms Ettinghausen said. But the HFEA is concerned NHS patients are waiting longer than those going private. Just over one out of every two private patients started treatment within a year, compared with one out of every three NHS patients. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “It is unacceptable fertility patients are being offered unnecessary treatments that will not help them in their goal of becoming parents. “We are working to improve access to NHS fertility services for all who need it. “We are also currently considering advice from the HFEA about priorities for law reform covering their regulatory powers, including their potential role in digital clinics. ” "

    "body": "2025/03/26 - Experts revealed that Many fertility patients in the UK are being offered unnecessary add-on treatments that have little or no proof of improving the likelihood of pregnancy, a report suggests. Add-ons are optional, non-essential treatments some private clinics offer in addition to proven treatments, such in-vitro fertilisation (IVF). According to the regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) , 73% of 1,500 patients surveyed between September and October 2024 said they had used an add-on in their latest round of treatment.

    "body": "2025/03/26 - Let’s dive into the details: Labour MP Kim Leadbeater says her bill includes “the strictest safeguards anywhere in the world” MPs voted in support of a proposal to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales, in November 2024. Months of detailed scrutiny and further votes in the Commons and Lords are required before the bill could become law. At present, laws throughout the UK prevent people from asking for medical help to die. However, proposed laws to give terminally ill adults the right to choose to end their life have been agreed in the Isle of Man, which is part of the British Isles. The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, external was introduced by backbench Labour MP Kim Leadbeater. It proposes giving terminally ill people the right to choose to end their life. It says that anyone who wants to end their life must: be over 18 and live in England and Wales, and have been registered with a GP for at least 12 months have the mental capacity to make the choice and be deemed to have expressed a clear, settled and informed wish, free from coercion or pressure be expected to die within six months make two separate declarations, witnessed and signed, about their wish to die satisfy two independent doctors that they are eligible - with at least seven days between each assessment Once a patient’s application has been approved, they would then have to wait 14 days before proceeding. A doctor would prepare the substance being used to end the patient’s life, but the person would take it themselves. The bill defines the co-ordinating doctor as a registered medical practitioner with “training, qualifications and experience” at a level to be specified by the health secretary. It does not say which drug would be used. It would be illegal to use dishonesty, pressure, or to coerce someone into declaring they want to end their life, with a possible 14-year prison sentence. Under the original proposals, a High Court judge would have to approve each request to end a life. However, Leadbetter suggested a three-person panel comprising a senior legal figure, a psychiatrist and a social worker should oversee applications instead. And the MPs reviewing the bill have agreed to adopt this approach. The proposal followed concerns the High Court would not have capacity to rule on each individual case. However, opponents say the move undermines the bill’s safeguards. Doctors must raise other options to assisted dying, MP says Many months of activity still lie ahead in the Commons and the Lords, and it is still possible that the bill could fall and not become law at all. There are 23 MPs on the committee scrutinising the proposed legislation line-by-line. They include 14 supporters - including two ministers - and nine opponents. The committee is holding public hearings and taking evidence from experts. It will then propose amendments to the bill. It is hoped that the committee process will be finished in time for the bill to return to the House of Commons on 25 April. At that stage, all MPs will have a chance to debate and vote on the changes proposed by the committee. There would then be more scrutiny in the Commons and the Lords, and further voting. Even if the bill cleared all its parliamentary hurdles, MPs had originally been told there would be a period of up to two years before any new law would be implemented. However, Leadbeater has proposed doubling this to four years, to allow more time to set up training and systems for what would be an entirely new service. If everything was ready more quickly, assisted dying could be in place ahead of the deadline, but the BBC understands that some ministers have expressed concern about the possible delay. Who are the MPs who will scrutinise the assisted dying bill? The historic vote saw 330 MPs support the assisted dying bill, and 275 reject it. MPs were given a free vote on the issue, which meant they could make their own decision rather than follow party instructions. The government is impartial on the issue. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer was among those to vote in favour of the bill, as was Chancellor Rachel Reeves. However, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, Foreign Secretary David Lammy, Health Secretary Wes Streeting and Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood all voted against. Most Conservative MPs rejected the bill, including party leader Kemi Badenoch. The former PM Rishi Sunak and former deputy PM Oliver Dowden were among the minority of Tory MPs who supported it. When MPs last voted on the issue in 2015, they rejected different proposals by 330 votes to 118, external. ‘Hardest decision of my career’: MPs wrestle with assisted dying choice Assisted dying: How did my MP vote? A separate bill is under discussion in Scotland. Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur drafted the Assisted Dying for Terminally Ill Adults (Scotland) Bill. If passed by MSPs, eligible applicants would have to: be resident in Scotland for at least 12 months be registered with a GP in Scotland be terminally ill have the mental capacity to make the request The bill is being considered by the health committee, external ahead of an initial vote by MSPs. The first stage of the committee’s work is due to be completed by 23 May 2025. In October 2024, Scottish Health Secretary Neil Gray said the proposed legislation went beyond the limits of Holyrood’s powers, and was a matter for Westminster. However, McArthur said he was confident the UK and Scottish governments could find a solution if MSPs backed his bill. ‘Northern Ireland is being left behind on assisted dying’ The Isle of Man and Jersey are both part of the British Isles but are able to set their own laws. They have each been considering different proposals to allow assisted dying. The Isle of Man parliament passed its Assisted Dying Bill on 25 March. The bill will now be sent for Royal Assent, where King Charles will give formal approval for it to become law. The scheme could be in place by 2027, and will cover adults who have lived on the island for five years and are expected to die within 12 months. Jersey’s politicians backed the principle of legalising assisted dying in 2021. And in May 2024, they approved plans to allow assisted dying for those with a terminal illness “causing unbearable suffering”. Final legislation is currently being written, and once approved, an 18-month implementation period would begin, meaning new rules would take effect in summer 2027 at the earliest. Guernsey: Request to make assisted dying legal could be made in 2025 Opponents warn that people could be put under pressure to end their lives and want improvements to palliative care instead. Paralympian and House of Lords crossbencher Baroness Grey-Thompson is a vocal critic. She told the BBC she is worried about “the impact on vulnerable people, on disabled people, [the risk of] coercive control, and the ability of doctors to make a six-month diagnosis”. Baroness Grey-Thompson is a long-standing critic of legalising assisted dying Actor and disability-rights activist Liz Carr, who made BBC One documentary Better Off Dead?, also opposes changing the law. “Some of us have very real fears based on our lived experience and based on what has happened in other countries where it’s legal,” she wrote on X. Dr Gordon Macdonald, from campaign group Care Not Killing, said: “The safest law is the one we currently have. “This bill is being rushed with indecent haste and ignores the deep-seated problems in the UK’s broken and patchy palliative care system. ” âPeople will make bad decisions because we donât talk honestly about deathâ ‘Palliative care is not good enough - and there’s no plan to fix it’ Leadbeater argues the law needs changing because some people “have a horrible, harrowing death”, however good their end-of-life or palliative care is. Cancer patient Nathaniel Dye worked on the bill with Leadbeater. He said it would allow people a death which was “as kind and compassionate as possible”. The Dignity in Dying campaign group said the bill provides the “most detailed, robust proposals” on the issue that “Westminster has ever considered”. According to chief executive Sarah Wootton, the fact that every year “up to 650 terminally ill people end their own lives, often in lonely and traumatic ways,” shows that the status quo is not working. Dame Esther Rantzen, who has stage four lung cancer, has joined Dignitas in Switzerland One of the highest-profile advocates for change is broadcaster Dame Esther Rantzen, who has stage-four lung cancer. “All I’m asking for is that we be given the dignity of choice,” Dame Esther told BBC News. “If I decide that my own life is not worth living, please may I ask for help to die?” Both the British Medical Association, external, which represents doctors, and the Royal College of Nursing, external are neutral on the issue. InDepth: The NHS is spending a fortune giving people a death they don’t want There is some debate over exactly what the various terms mean, external. However, assisted dying generally refers to a person who is terminally ill receiving lethal drugs from a medical practitioner, which they administer themselves. Assisted suicide is intentionally helping another person to end their life, including someone who is not terminally ill. That could involve providing lethal medication or helping them travel to another jurisdiction to die. Euthanasia is the act of deliberately ending a person’s life to relieve suffering in which a lethal drug is administered by a physician. Patients may not be terminally ill. There are two types: voluntary euthanasia, where a patient consents; and non-voluntary, where they cannot because, for example, they are in a coma. The Dignity in Dying campaign group says more than 200 million people around the world have legal access to assisted dying, external. Switzerland has allowed assisted suicide since 1942. Its Dignitas facility accepts foreign patients as well as Swiss nationals, and between 1998 and 2023 it helped 571 Britons to die, external. Assisted suicide is also legal in Austria. In the US, 10 states - Oregon, California, New Mexico, Colorado, Washington, Hawaii, New Jersey, Vermont, Maine and Washington DC - allow “physician-assisted dying”. It permits doctors to prescribe lethal drugs for self-administration. Voluntary euthanasia is legal in Canada, where it is called medical assistance in dying. It can be provided by a doctor or nurse practitioner, either in person or through the prescription of drugs for self-administration. Medically assisted dying accounted for 4. 7% of deaths in Canada in 2023. It is also legal in Spain and Colombia, both of which also permit assisted suicide. Assisted dying is legal in some parts of Australia, but the law differs across states. New Zealand’s End of Life Choice Act legalises assisted dying and allows adults in their final months of life to request assistance from a medical professional. Three countries have laws that allow people who are not terminally ill to receive assistance to die: The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. How does assisted dying work in other countries? Update 3 January 2025: This piece has been updated to give further detail on the definition of a co-ordinating doctor. "

InDepth: The NHS is spending a fortune giving people a death they don’t want There is some debate over exactly what the various terms mean, external. However, assisted dying generally refers to a person who is terminally ill receiving lethal drugs from a medical practitioner, which they administer themselves. Assisted suicide is intentionally helping another person to end their life, including someone who is not terminally ill. That could involve providing lethal medication or helping them travel to another jurisdiction to die. Euthanasia is the act of deliberately ending a person’s life to relieve suffering in which a lethal drug is administered by a physician. Patients may not be terminally ill. There are two types: voluntary euthanasia, where a patient consents; and non-voluntary, where they cannot because, for example, they are in a coma. The Dignity in Dying campaign group says more than 200 million people around the world have legal access to assisted dying, external. Switzerland has allowed assisted suicide since 1942. Its Dignitas facility accepts foreign patients as well as Swiss nationals, and between 1998 and 2023 it helped 571 Britons to die, external. Assisted suicide is also legal in Austria. In the US, 10 states - Oregon, California, New Mexico, Colorado, Washington, Hawaii, New Jersey, Vermont, Maine and Washington DC - allow “physician-assisted dying”. It permits doctors to prescribe lethal drugs for self-administration. Voluntary euthanasia is legal in Canada, where it is called medical assistance in dying. It can be provided by a doctor or nurse practitioner, either in person or through the prescription of drugs for self-administration. Medically assisted dying accounted for 4. 7% of deaths in Canada in 2023. It is also legal in Spain and Colombia, both of which also permit assisted suicide. Assisted dying is legal in some parts of Australia, but the law differs across states. New Zealand’s End of Life Choice Act legalises assisted dying and allows adults in their final months of life to request assistance from a medical professional. Three countries have laws that allow people who are not terminally ill to receive assistance to die: The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. How does assisted dying work in other countries? Update 3 January 2025: This piece has been updated to give further detail on the definition of a co-ordinating doctor. "

    "title": "New: Baby deaths trust claimed £2m 'good care' payments",
    "body": "2025/03/26 - Experts revealed that An NHS trust criticised over the avoidable death of a newborn baby was paid £2m for providing good maternity care, the BBC can reveal. A senior coroner ruled on Friday that University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay (UHMB) NHS trust contributed to Ida Lock’s death and had failed to learn lessons from previous maternity failures. Despite this, the trust claimed it had met all 10 standards under an NHS scheme aimed at promoting safe treatment. Ida’s mother Sarah Robinson said it was “another kick in the teeth” while her father Ryan Lock labelled it “disgusting”. The trust, which has previously apologised for its failings in Ida’s care, declined to comment about the NHS payment scheme. Senior coroner for Lancashire James Adeley concluded that Ida had died due to the gross failure of three midwives to provide basic medical care. Ida, who was born at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary (RLI) on 9 November 2019, died a week later after suffering a serious brain injury due to a lack of oxygen. Dr Adeley ruled her death had been caused by the midwives’ failure to deliver the infant “urgently when it was apparent she was in distress” and contributed to by the lead midwife’s “wholly incompetent failure to provide basic neonatal resuscitation”. He said eight opportunities had been missed “to alter Ida’s clinical course”. Her five-week inquest at Preston County Hall heard that many of the issues identified in a 2015 independent review of UHMB’s maternity services were still evident in November 2019. The RLI is run by the UHMB trust. Under the Maternity Incentive Scheme run by NHS Resolution, the health service’s insurance arm, maternity departments in England are encouraged to provide good care by meeting 10 safety standards, including properly investigating deaths and listening to parents’ concerns. Trusts which certify they have met these standards receive a rebate on their insurance premiums, in addition to a share of money paid by NHS trusts which do not. In the five years that the scheme has been running, UHMB said it had met the 10 standards four times. In 2018, the first year of the programme, the trust’s self-certification led to it being paid £1,288,241. In 2019, the year of Ida’s death, it received £734,112 after again claiming to have hit all of the criteria. The UHMB trust also claimed a perfect 10-out-of-10 record in 2020 but their submission was reviewed by NHS Resolution following a critical inspection of maternity services by the Care Quality Commission. The regulator’s report rated maternity services as “inadequate”, with UHMB’s score downgraded to three out of 10. Consequently, UHMB was not given any money that year by NHS Resolution, and the trust was made to repay most of the amount it had received in 2019. When told about the payments scheme and how the trust had benefitted from it, Mr Lock said it was “disgusting”. He said: “It’s painting a false picture so they can receive money. ” A former maternity risk manager at the trust, Rox-Anne Hetherington, said Morecambe Bay’s actions were in keeping with her experience. “I can, hand-on-heart, say that it wasn’t a case of ‘What have we done to [make things better]?’ “It was a case of ‘What are we going to say we’ve done?’” Dr Bill Kirkup, whose 2015 inquiry exposed widespread failings in maternity care, including the preventable deaths of 11 babies and a mother at the trust’s Furness General Hospital in Cumbria, also said he wasn’t surprised. “Some trusts put a lot of effort into how they can present the best picture of themselves, and much less effort into whether they’re actually making improvements underneath,” he said. UHMB’s claims are in line with other struggling trusts which have also made similar erroneous submissions under the Maternity Incentive Scheme. The Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust was forced to repay almost £1m after it similarly claimed to have met all of the safety standards. A review of its maternity care, published in 2022, found more than 200 babies and mothers could have survived with proper care. The East Kent University Hospitals trust, where an inquiry found at least 45 babies could have survived, was also forced to repay £2m after falsely claiming it had met the safety criteria. In a statement, NHS Resolution said “University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS trust initially self-reported full compliance with the Maternity Incentive Scheme in years 1, 2, 3 and 5. “However subsequent NHS Resolution reviews of the Trust’s evidence for years 2 and 3 following the publication of their CQC report demonstrated that they were not fully compliant for those years. “The Trust was required to repay any funds for those years. The previously granted rebate was returned to NHS Resolution and was redistributed to all compliant Trusts. ” The UHMB, which has previously apologised for its failings in Ida Lock’s death, declined to comment about its participation in the Maternity Incentive Scheme.

    "body": "2025/03/25 - Experts revealed that The UK has a new watch list of 24 infectious diseases that could pose the greatest future threat to public health. Some are viruses with global pandemic potential - like Covid - while others are illnesses that have no existing treatments or could cause significant harm. Avian, or bird, flu is on the list, as well as mosquito-spread illnesses that may become common with rising temperatures from climate change, according to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). The aim is to steer scientists and investors into making new tests and vaccines or medicines in preparation. There is no ranking within the list, since threats constantly change, UKHSA chief scientific officer Prof Isabel Oliver says. And it will be updated at least once a year, to avoid a repeat of the Covid pandemic, where experts had been planning for an entirely different outbreak - influenza. “When Covid arrived, it took too long to adjust our response to a different threat, which was part of the reason we ended up in lockdown,” Prof Mark Woolhouse, director of the Tackling Infections to Benefit Africa, University of Edinburgh, said. “Since the pandemic, there have been many initiatives to better understand the diversity of pandemic threats that the UK and the world may face in the coming years. “The UKHSA’s pathogen prioritisation exercise is a welcome contribution to this global effort. ” A family of viruses called Paramyxoviridae, which includes measles, is on the list. And this was the type of pandemic threat public-health agencies around the world were most worried about, Prof Woolhouse said. A novel measles-like virus would be highly spreadable and “impossible to control by even the strictest lockdown”, making it “a threat far worse than Covid. ” “It would also be considerably more deadly and, unlike Covid, it would be a [major] threat to children,” Prof Woolhouse said. Prof Oliver said the UKHSA would consult animal-health colleagues for future updates, since many new and emerging outbreaks were zoonotic disease that jumped species to infect humans. Some bacteria also feature, including those such as gonorrohoea where resistance to existing antibiotic treatments is becoming an issue. "

    "title": "Latest: Blood brothers - bonds and betrayal on a rugby pitch",
    "body": "2025/03/24 - Let’s dive into the details: Blood brothers - bonds and betrayal on a rugby pitch Tom Williams, kneeling on one knee, runs his hand over the blades of grass. His eyes are desperately scanning as his heartbeat rises further. It is deep in the second half of the 2009 Heineken Cup quarter-final at the Stoop. Williams’ team - Harlequins - are a point down. It is the biggest match the 25-year-old has ever played in. Harlequins are aiming to make the last four for the first time. Trying to stop them are a star-studded Leinster team featuring the likes of Brian O’Driscoll, Jamie Heaslip, Rob Kearney and Felipe Contepomi. The stakes are sky-high and time is tight. But Williams has a more pressing concern. “I had taken the blood capsule out of my sock, put it in my mouth, and then tried to chew down on it,” he remembers on Sportâs Strangest Crimes: Bloodgate, a BBC Radio 5 Live podcast that delves deeper than ever into one of rugby’s most infamous scandals. “But it fell out on to the floor. I’m red-green colour-blind. I can’t see the thing on the floor so I am searching around for it. “It’s just the ridiculousness of it. ” A few minutes later, everyone could see it. LISTEN: Bloodgate - Sport’s Strangest Crimes Williams, having found the capsule and burst it between his teeth, was led off the pitch, with strangely scarlet blood streaming from his mouth, splattering on Quins’ famous quartered shirt. A blood injury meant Harlequins could bring their star fly-half Nick Evans, previously substituted, back on for a late drop-goal shot at glory. Williams departed the pitch against Leinster accompanied by physio Steph Brennan, left, watched by the Sky Sports cameras The convenience of Williams’ injury raised eyebrows and suspicions. “Who punched Tom Williams in the mouth, Tom Williams?” said former Bath and England fly-half Stuart Barnes as he commentated on Sky Sports. Further along in the press box, Brian Moore was working for BBC Radio. “What a load of rubbish. That is gamesmanship at best, downright cheating at worst,” he said on air. Down on the touchline, Leinster’s staff were making a similar point, if in stronger language. “As it was playing out [Harlequins director of rugby] Dean Richards was on the sidelines and I had a few words with him,” says Ronan O’Donnell, the Irish side’s operations manager. “I’d probably have to bleep a few of them out. I just told him he was cheating and he knew he was cheating. ” O’Donnell repeated his claim to one of the touchline officials. “He showed me his fingers,” remembers O’Donnell. “He’d got some of the ‘blood’ on his fingers and it was like a Crayola marker had burst on his hands. It was that sort of texture and colour. He wasn’t happy about it either. ” Williams headed down the tunnel, surrounded by Harlequins staff. Members of the Leinster backroom followed in hot pursuit. The truth went with them. But it didn’t take long to emerge. This video can not be played Bloodgate: The scandal that rocked rugby union Richards was asked about Williams’ apparent injury immediately after the match. “He came off with a cut in his mouth and you have a right, if someone has a cut, to bring them off,” he said. “So your conscience is clear on that one?” persisted touchline reporter Graham Simmons. “Yes, very much so,” affirmed Richards. The capsule was done, but the cover-up had begun. Williams, by then, did have a cut in his mouth. Locked in the home dressing room, while Leinster staff and match officials hammered on the door demanding entry and an explanation, he had pleaded with club doctor Wendy Chapman to use a scalpel to create a real injury in place of the fake one. With the volume increasing outside, she reluctantly did so. A photo was taken as evidence to support Quins’ conspiracy. “We were trying to win and we thought nothing of it in terms of ethics,” Williams tells Bloodgate. “We thought we were just pushing the boundaries and doing what it took to try and get a result. ” They had failed to do so on the pitch. A limping Evans had shanked a late drop-goal and Leinster hung on to win. Soon, they needed to do so in a boardroom. Three months after the match, Williams, Chapman, Richards and Harlequins physio Steph Brennan were sat in the plush offices of a central London law firm. All faced misconduct charges. And a big screen. The screen played television pictures which had never originally been broadcast. They showed Brennan appearing to pass something to Williams as he went on the pitch to treat another player. Williams then appeared to fold the mystery object into the top of his sock. And then finally, a few minutes later, the wing, kneeled, retrieved it and, after dropping it on the floor, placed it back in his mouth. Together with the footage of him walking off the pitch, winking to a team-mate en route, it made a compelling case. Dean Richards was a legendary player, winning 48 England caps and representing the British and Irish Lions, before moving into coaching The club had its defence though. Richards had co-ordinated their accounts. Williams, they all claimed, had been retrieving his mouthguard from his sock. His mouth was already bleeding. Chapman had applied gauze to Williams’ mouth, not a scalpel. Richards called the charges against him and his club “ridiculous”, claiming that fair play was “in-built” to his coaching. Brennan, who had bought the capsule used by Williams from a fancy dress shop in Clapham, claimed never to have seen them outside of a Halloween party. The panel presiding over the case were suspicious, but, with Quins’ backroom staff sticking rigidly to their story, they couldn’t unpick the full connivance. “It was just so obviously a lie,” says Williams. “I realised I was properly in trouble. ” When the verdict came, it landed wholly on Williams. He was banned from rugby for a year. Richards, Chapman and Brennan were all cleared, with the club handed a 250,000 euro fine for failing to control their player. WIlliams was, in the eyes of the adjudicating panel, a lone rogue agent. Harlequins, united in both the crime and cover-up, were suddenly divided by a punishment that touched only one of their number. Ugo Monye, right, spent the whole of his 13-year professional career at Harlequins Williams, having supposedly brought disgrace on Harlequins by independently concocting the blood capsule plan, sought advice from the Rugby Players’ Association. They urged him to appeal, to blow the whistle on the whole plot. But the club had other ideas. Williams was offered a new two-year deal, three years of guaranteed employment at the club once he had retired and a promise to help him build a career outside of rugby. He just had to hold back on the real story. He had to be a team-mate once more. He had to protect the club that meant so much to them all. The full extent of the plot, the complicity of the club’s medical staff and coaches, couldn’t come out. “They said to me ‘do you understand the impact of this decision you’re about to make? If you come forward and show this, Harlequins will be kicked out of Europe, your friends’ playing opportunities for their countries will be reduced, Steph and Wendy will be struck off, we’ll lose sponsors we’ll lose money’,” Williams remembers. “Playing rugby was all I wanted to do and all I felt that I could do. “So I was stuck between coming forward and telling the truth and falling on my sword. And I didn’t know what to do. ” “I’d have taken the rap,” Ugo Monye, Williams’ team-mate at the time, tells Bloodgate. “With the deal that was supposedly being offered, 100%. ” The pressure was extreme. Harlequins were desperate to contain a toxic scandal. Banned and branded a cheat, Williams wanted to tell the truth, explain his actions and rescue his rugby dreams. At one point, he asked for more money in exchange for his silence; Â£390,000 to pay off his mortgage and a four-year contract. Quins refused. In a statement from the time Quins chairman Charles Jillings described Williams’ demands as “exorbitant” and “shocking”. He insisted that “under no circumstances was the financial proposal a reward for Tom’s silence. ” “I’d sunk to rock bottom,” says Williams. “It was a catastrophic period from a personal standpoint. ” And all the time, the clock was ticking. Williams had one month to appeal against his ban, to go public and get his career back on track. Two days before the window to appeal shut, an email landed in Williams inbox. He wasn’t the only one considering an appeal. The European Cup organisers too were unhappy that he was the only person found guilty. They knew there must be more to the case. The chances of one young player coming up with such a scheme on his own and carrying it out in secret in the tight and tightly-controlled environment of a professional club were remote. They wrote to tell Williams they were to appeal against Richards, Brennan and Chapman being cleared. They would call him as a witness, cross-examine him and, if he didn’t comply, level a second misconduct charge at him. “His face literally just went white,” remembers Alex, Williams’ girlfriend at the time, now wife. A final summit meeting with the Harlequins hierarchy was called. Tom and Alex drove to the Surrey home of one of the club’s board. Drinks and snacks were laid out, but the conversation soon turned to business. “We were going round and round in circles,” remembers Tom. “Harlequins were saying to me, if I fell on my sword, for want of a better term, they would guarantee me future employment, pay off some of my mortgage, pay for me to go on sabbatical and we’ll guarantee my girlfriend’s future employment. “On the other hand, if I came forward and told the truth they said l would bury the club. ” Frustrated, stressed and tired after three hours of back and forth, Alex excused herself for a cigarette break. As she stubbed it out and prepared to go back into the meeting, she saw Tom coming in the opposite direction. He had given up. He would run away, leave the country, turn his back on rugby, start again - anything to get out of this situation. Alex hadn’t finished though. She wanted to ask one more question of the 13 men in the room. She walked back in. “I remember the surprise on their faces when it was just me standing there,” she says. “I said ‘I’m really sorry to bother you again, but do you mind if I just have you for a couple more minutes? I just want to ask you all individually one question’. “I went round and I actually pointed to every single person and I just said, ‘Is this Tom’s fault?’ And each of them gave a resounding no. Every single one of them. ” “Alex humanised me again, because I had dehumanised myself, Harlequins had dehumanised me,” says Tom. “I was a pawn by that point, and I was ready to be moved in any way that anyone pushed me. “She was the person from outside of this tight rugby centric-environment who could cut through that. “She said what had gone on was not my fault - what had gone on was wrong - and made people realise that. ” Then-Leinster coach Michael Chieka, far right in black coat, was keen to make his point to match officials as Tom Williams headed for the dressing room Early the next morning, Tom got a phone call. Richards had resigned. Harlequins said they would support Williams telling the truth and accept the fall-out. The game was up. The cover-up would be uncovered. The truth would change lives. At a hearing in Glasgow, Williams told the full story. Richards admitted instructing physio Brennan to carry the blood capsules in his medical bag “just in case”. He was judged to be the “directing mind” of the Bloodgate plot and banned from rugby for three years. Brennan admitted buying the fake blood in advance and was described as Richards’ “willing lieutenant”. He was banned from the sport for two years and a dream job working with England, all lined up, was gone. Harlequins’ club doctor Chapman was referred to the General Medical Council. By cutting open Tom’s mouth, she had contravened a central principle of medicine to “do no harm”. She said she was “ashamed” and “horrified” by what she had done, but she had an unlikely supporter. Arthur Tanner - the Leinster doctor that day at the Stoop, one of those incensed by Tom’s fake injury - spoke up for her. “When it transpired that she had been forced and coerced into doing it I really felt very, very sorry for her because I realised there was going to be a difficult two or three years ahead of her,” he said. Tom, who had pleaded with Chapman to cut his mouth, also supported her, telling the hearing she is “as much a victim in all this as me”. “It’s a huge regret of mine… putting her in a position where she felt she had no other option but to do it,” says Tom. Chapman was cleared to return to medicine. Of the quartet though, Williams was the only one to stay at Harlequins. At the first game of the following season, some opposition fans turned up dressed as vampires. He was targeted on the pitch, with opposing players aiming taunts, and sometimes punches, at him. There was no sanctuary in the home dressing room either. “A number of my team-mates would have been loyal to Dean Richards and felt that I’d betrayed not only him, but also them as a club,” remembers Williams. “It definitely impacted them, there was definitely a level of distrust, probably dislike as well. ” Williams became a quieter, sadder, slower presence. The zip was gone from his game, the smile was gone from his face. It seemed he was just playing out his contract, an unwanted reminder of the past as Harlequins built an exciting new team under new boss Conor O’Shea during the 2011-12 season. “I’d lost every morsel of confidence that I possibly could have had,” remembers Williams. “I wasn’t in the team. I was just that person around training who had done something in the past. ” But, after a starring cameo in a win over French giants Toulouse, something reignited in Williams’ game. The season ended with Harlequins winning their first Premiership crown in the Twickenham sun, with Williams scoring the first try in front of Alex and their young son. “It’s curious how sport works, how life works out,” says Williams. “You go from dead and buried to feeling the elation of being on top of the world. ” Williams scored the opening try for Harlequins in the 2012 Premiership final But you can also go in the opposite direction. Williams played for Harlequins until 2015 when moved on to the coaching staff. In 2019, he left rugby to pursue a career in consultancy. “About five years ago, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and I suspect that it came from this event,” he says. “I’ve been on medication ever since, and I struggle on a day-to-day basis. “My initial impression is always to trust, and that got me in trouble in the first place - but it’s how I operate best. I try and see the best in people. “I try and see the best in everyone involved. And I wish them the best because there’s no point holding on to it. “Ultimately, it was a game of sport, but it did mean everything to me at the time. “I wish I had the self-awareness and perspective I have now. This video can not be played Tom Williams on the legacy of âBloodgateâ “I am very, very happy now. I’ve got three children who are healthy and happy, and I feel like I’m building a life for myself that isn’t identified by a moment in time in 2009. ” Escaping the taint of what spilled from the capsule and cut that day has been hard for all involved. Dean Richards and Mark Evans both declined to be interviewed for this podcast series. Steph Brennan did not respond to our requests, while Dr Wendy Chapman could not be reached. "

    "body": "2025/03/24 - Let’s dive into the details: Blood brothers - bonds and betrayal on a rugby pitch Tom Williams, kneeling on one knee, runs his hand over the blades of grass. His eyes are desperately scanning as his heartbeat rises further. It is deep in the second half of the 2009 Heineken Cup quarter-final at the Stoop. Williams’ team - Harlequins - are a point down. It is the biggest match the 25-year-old has ever played in. Harlequins are aiming to make the last four for the first time. Trying to stop them are a star-studded Leinster team featuring the likes of Brian O’Driscoll, Jamie Heaslip, Rob Kearney and Felipe Contepomi. The stakes are sky-high and time is tight. But Williams has a more pressing concern. “I had taken the blood capsule out of my sock, put it in my mouth, and then tried to chew down on it,” he remembers on Sportâs Strangest Crimes: Bloodgate, a BBC Radio 5 Live podcast that delves deeper than ever into one of rugby’s most infamous scandals. “But it fell out on to the floor. I’m red-green colour-blind. I can’t see the thing on the floor so I am searching around for it. “It’s just the ridiculousness of it. ” A few minutes later, everyone could see it. LISTEN: Bloodgate - Sport’s Strangest Crimes Williams, having found the capsule and burst it between his teeth, was led off the pitch, with strangely scarlet blood streaming from his mouth, splattering on Quins’ famous quartered shirt. A blood injury meant Harlequins could bring their star fly-half Nick Evans, previously substituted, back on for a late drop-goal shot at glory. Williams departed the pitch against Leinster accompanied by physio Steph Brennan, left, watched by the Sky Sports cameras The convenience of Williams’ injury raised eyebrows and suspicions. “Who punched Tom Williams in the mouth, Tom Williams?” said former Bath and England fly-half Stuart Barnes as he commentated on Sky Sports. Further along in the press box, Brian Moore was working for BBC Radio. “What a load of rubbish. That is gamesmanship at best, downright cheating at worst,” he said on air. Down on the touchline, Leinster’s staff were making a similar point, if in stronger language. “As it was playing out [Harlequins director of rugby] Dean Richards was on the sidelines and I had a few words with him,” says Ronan O’Donnell, the Irish side’s operations manager. “I’d probably have to bleep a few of them out. I just told him he was cheating and he knew he was cheating. ” O’Donnell repeated his claim to one of the touchline officials. “He showed me his fingers,” remembers O’Donnell. “He’d got some of the ‘blood’ on his fingers and it was like a Crayola marker had burst on his hands. It was that sort of texture and colour. He wasn’t happy about it either. ” Williams headed down the tunnel, surrounded by Harlequins staff. Members of the Leinster backroom followed in hot pursuit.

Richards had co-ordinated their accounts. Williams, they all claimed, had been retrieving his mouthguard from his sock. His mouth was already bleeding. Chapman had applied gauze to Williams’ mouth, not a scalpel. Richards called the charges against him and his club “ridiculous”, claiming that fair play was “in-built” to his coaching. Brennan, who had bought the capsule used by Williams from a fancy dress shop in Clapham, claimed never to have seen them outside of a Halloween party. The panel presiding over the case were suspicious, but, with Quins’ backroom staff sticking rigidly to their story, they couldn’t unpick the full connivance. “It was just so obviously a lie,” says Williams. “I realised I was properly in trouble. ” When the verdict came, it landed wholly on Williams. He was banned from rugby for a year. Richards, Chapman and Brennan were all cleared, with the club handed a 250,000 euro fine for failing to control their player. WIlliams was, in the eyes of the adjudicating panel, a lone rogue agent. Harlequins, united in both the crime and cover-up, were suddenly divided by a punishment that touched only one of their number. Ugo Monye, right, spent the whole of his 13-year professional career at Harlequins Williams, having supposedly brought disgrace on Harlequins by independently concocting the blood capsule plan, sought advice from the Rugby Players’ Association. They urged him to appeal, to blow the whistle on the whole plot. But the club had other ideas. Williams was offered a new two-year deal, three years of guaranteed employment at the club once he had retired and a promise to help him build a career outside of rugby. He just had to hold back on the real story. He had to be a team-mate once more. He had to protect the club that meant so much to them all. The full extent of the plot, the complicity of the club’s medical staff and coaches, couldn’t come out. “They said to me ‘do you understand the impact of this decision you’re about to make? If you come forward and show this, Harlequins will be kicked out of Europe, your friends’ playing opportunities for their countries will be reduced, Steph and Wendy will be struck off, we’ll lose sponsors we’ll lose money’,” Williams remembers. “Playing rugby was all I wanted to do and all I felt that I could do. “So I was stuck between coming forward and telling the truth and falling on my sword. And I didn’t know what to do. ” “I’d have taken the rap,” Ugo Monye, Williams’ team-mate at the time, tells Bloodgate. “With the deal that was supposedly being offered, 100%. ” The pressure was extreme. Harlequins were desperate to contain a toxic scandal. Banned and branded a cheat, Williams wanted to tell the truth, explain his actions and rescue his rugby dreams. At one point, he asked for more money in exchange for his silence; Â£390,000 to pay off his mortgage and a four-year contract. Quins refused. In a statement from the time Quins chairman Charles Jillings described Williams’ demands as “exorbitant” and “shocking”. He insisted that “under no circumstances was the financial proposal a reward for Tom’s silence. ” “I’d sunk to rock bottom,” says Williams. “It was a catastrophic period from a personal standpoint. ” And all the time, the clock was ticking. Williams had one month to appeal against his ban, to go public and get his career back on track. Two days before the window to appeal shut, an email landed in Williams inbox. He wasn’t the only one considering an appeal. The European Cup organisers too were unhappy that he was the only person found guilty. They knew there must be more to the case. The chances of one young player coming up with such a scheme on his own and carrying it out in secret in the tight and tightly-controlled environment of a professional club were remote. They wrote to tell Williams they were to appeal against Richards, Brennan and Chapman being cleared. They would call him as a witness, cross-examine him and, if he didn’t comply, level a second misconduct charge at him. “His face literally just went white,” remembers Alex, Williams’ girlfriend at the time, now wife. A final summit meeting with the Harlequins hierarchy was called. Tom and Alex drove to the Surrey home of one of the club’s board. Drinks and snacks were laid out, but the conversation soon turned to business. “We were going round and round in circles,” remembers Tom. “Harlequins were saying to me, if I fell on my sword, for want of a better term, they would guarantee me future employment, pay off some of my mortgage, pay for me to go on sabbatical and we’ll guarantee my girlfriend’s future employment. “On the other hand, if I came forward and told the truth they said l would bury the club. ” Frustrated, stressed and tired after three hours of back and forth, Alex excused herself for a cigarette break. As she stubbed it out and prepared to go back into the meeting, she saw Tom coming in the opposite direction. He had given up. He would run away, leave the country, turn his back on rugby, start again - anything to get out of this situation. Alex hadn’t finished though. She wanted to ask one more question of the 13 men in the room. She walked back in. “I remember the surprise on their faces when it was just me standing there,” she says. “I said ‘I’m really sorry to bother you again, but do you mind if I just have you for a couple more minutes? I just want to ask you all individually one question’. “I went round and I actually pointed to every single person and I just said, ‘Is this Tom’s fault?’ And each of them gave a resounding no. Every single one of them. ” “Alex humanised me again, because I had dehumanised myself, Harlequins had dehumanised me,” says Tom. “I was a pawn by that point, and I was ready to be moved in any way that anyone pushed me. “She was the person from outside of this tight rugby centric-environment who could cut through that. “She said what had gone on was not my fault - what had gone on was wrong - and made people realise that. ” Then-Leinster coach Michael Chieka, far right in black coat, was keen to make his point to match officials as Tom Williams headed for the dressing room Early the next morning, Tom got a phone call. Richards had resigned. Harlequins said they would support Williams telling the truth and accept the fall-out. The game was up. The cover-up would be uncovered. The truth would change lives. At a hearing in Glasgow, Williams told the full story. Richards admitted instructing physio Brennan to carry the blood capsules in his medical bag “just in case”. He was judged to be the “directing mind” of the Bloodgate plot and banned from rugby for three years. Brennan admitted buying the fake blood in advance and was described as Richards’ “willing lieutenant”. He was banned from the sport for two years and a dream job working with England, all lined up, was gone. Harlequins’ club doctor Chapman was referred to the General Medical Council. By cutting open Tom’s mouth, she had contravened a central principle of medicine to “do no harm”. She said she was “ashamed” and “horrified” by what she had done, but she had an unlikely supporter. Arthur Tanner - the Leinster doctor that day at the Stoop, one of those incensed by Tom’s fake injury - spoke up for her. “When it transpired that she had been forced and coerced into doing it I really felt very, very sorry for her because I realised there was going to be a difficult two or three years ahead of her,” he said. Tom, who had pleaded with Chapman to cut his mouth, also supported her, telling the hearing she is “as much a victim in all this as me”. “It’s a huge regret of mine… putting her in a position where she felt she had no other option but to do it,” says Tom. Chapman was cleared to return to medicine. Of the quartet though, Williams was the only one to stay at Harlequins. At the first game of the following season, some opposition fans turned up dressed as vampires. He was targeted on the pitch, with opposing players aiming taunts, and sometimes punches, at him. There was no sanctuary in the home dressing room either. “A number of my team-mates would have been loyal to Dean Richards and felt that I’d betrayed not only him, but also them as a club,” remembers Williams. “It definitely impacted them, there was definitely a level of distrust, probably dislike as well. ” Williams became a quieter, sadder, slower presence. The zip was gone from his game, the smile was gone from his face. It seemed he was just playing out his contract, an unwanted reminder of the past as Harlequins built an exciting new team under new boss Conor O’Shea during the 2011-12 season. “I’d lost every morsel of confidence that I possibly could have had,” remembers Williams. “I wasn’t in the team. I was just that person around training who had done something in the past. ” But, after a starring cameo in a win over French giants Toulouse, something reignited in Williams’ game. The season ended with Harlequins winning their first Premiership crown in the Twickenham sun, with Williams scoring the first try in front of Alex and their young son. “It’s curious how sport works, how life works out,” says Williams. “You go from dead and buried to feeling the elation of being on top of the world. ” Williams scored the opening try for Harlequins in the 2012 Premiership final But you can also go in the opposite direction. Williams played for Harlequins until 2015 when moved on to the coaching staff. In 2019, he left rugby to pursue a career in consultancy. “About five years ago, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and I suspect that it came from this event,” he says. “I’ve been on medication ever since, and I struggle on a day-to-day basis. “My initial impression is always to trust, and that got me in trouble in the first place - but it’s how I operate best. I try and see the best in people. “I try and see the best in everyone involved. And I wish them the best because there’s no point holding on to it. “Ultimately, it was a game of sport, but it did mean everything to me at the time. “I wish I had the self-awareness and perspective I have now. This video can not be played Tom Williams on the legacy of âBloodgateâ “I am very, very happy now. I’ve got three children who are healthy and happy, and I feel like I’m building a life for myself that isn’t identified by a moment in time in 2009. ” Escaping the taint of what spilled from the capsule and cut that day has been hard for all involved. Dean Richards and Mark Evans both declined to be interviewed for this podcast series. Steph Brennan did not respond to our requests, while Dr Wendy Chapman could not be reached. "

    "title": "New: Rachel Reeves is feeling the heat ahead of her Spring Statement",
    "body": "2025/03/22 - It has been recently reported that In a discussion ahead of next week’s statement, the chancellor hints at a more guarded approach amid global uncertainty - and issues a warning. A thick skin is a must for our top politicians. There’s rolling news, nonstop social media and public scepticism. Add in the battle with the country’s deep and persistent problems. And these days the problems include constant and very real global turmoil. The questions for the politicians are profound and that’s something the Chancellor Rachel Reeves gets. “I recognise that with the privilege of doing a job like the one I’m doing today also comes a great deal of scrutiny. I absolutely believe that every policy that I announce, every pound of public money, of taxpayers money that I spend, and every pound that I take from people in terms of taxes is properly scrutinised. That’s part of the job,” she tells me. But next comes an admission, from this professionally tough politician, described to me by one of her colleagues once as ‘hard as nails’, that when things get personal, she doesn’t like it. “One of the things I think that I find hard, even with the thicker skin I guess I must have developed over these last 14 or so years, is some of the personal criticism because that’s not the sort of politics that I do,” she tells me. As admissions go it’s modest and general in nature. But read in the context of someone who is taking decisions with big consequences for many, many people’s lives while at the same time being someone who has faced awkward questions about her own job history and CV, this may be Reeves’ way of telling us that she’s feeling the heat. Perhaps the admission came because this was an unusual conversation. We were not under the studio lights but instead in the Treasury itself for the making of a BBC documentary, The Making of a Chancellor, trying to understand the thinking behind the big decisions Reeves takes. Our conversation came a couple of hours after the Labour government had revealed billions of pounds of welfare cuts, most notably stricter tests for personal independence payments (Pips). The aim is to save £5bn by 2030. But there is real anxiety in her party about what she and Sir Keir Starmer are doing. And when I ask the chancellor about these cuts, she prefers to speak about Labour’s broader vision for the economy, instead giving a warning - that this Labour government won’t be able to do what its members and backers might have expected and hand out handsome increases to government departments like its predecessor. “There’s growth, real growth every year actually, in public spending, but not at the levels that we were able to deliver under the last Labour government when the economy was growing much more strongly,” she tells me. “We’ve got to ramp it up and continue to ensure that we’re doing everything we can to lift living standards and in the end that is through growing the economy. We can’t tax and spend our way to higher living standards and better public services. That’s not available in the world we live in today. ” The signalling for the Spring Statement is that there will be no more tax rises and no more increases in government spending, instead a scalpel is set to be taken to some departments. This is the opposite of what she did in the autumn and the opposite of what you’d assume Labour chancellors do. This more guarded approach is in part a response to the uncertainty created by the Trump administration - nobody knows quite what is around the corner. But she has been taking inspiration from across the Atlantic for many years. One of Reeves’ first jobs was working as an economist at the British Embassy in Washington from 2002 to 2003. That era defined her early thinking and she’s still gazing to America for inspiration – Reeves’ first call as chancellor was to Janet Yellen, then her counterpart in DC as treasury secretary in president Joe Biden’s administration. I ask Yellen for her advice to Reeves now, nearly a year on. She says to keep doing the difficult things: “I think she [Reeves] should, you know, stick with the course that she set out and move things, move things forward with, you know, as much speed and commitment as she possibly can. ” But there is tension in Reeves’ approach. Labour is increasing tax, but squeezing some spending. Ministers are rolling back some rules and regulations, but giving workers more rights at work. In effect they are putting the brakes and the accelerator on at the same time. She is aware there is no one thing she can do to suddenly create prosperity. And so how long can people be expected to wait for the change they’ve been promised? Communication is key according to Yellen: “Before you get improvements that are noticeable to voters in infrastructure and job creation, it does take time and so you don’t get the immediate payoff. “And so communication, I think, is very important to make the population understand that this is an approach that requires some patience to see the payoff. But truly, it’s the only way, over the medium term, to boost living standards in major economies. ” Reeves is asking voters to believe that some of the tough choices she is making can be explained, at least in part, by the fact that the world around her has changed in a way she hadn’t anticipated when her party was beginning to prepare its new offer to the public in the aftermath of Labour’s 2019 election defeat. First, a massive £28bn borrowing that had been earmarked to spend on green projects was binned, a necessary response to the economic turmoil under Liz Truss according to Labour - not a view shared by opponents who never thought Labour’s policy credible. Whereas once she said she would be the first green chancellor, now Reeves is signing off airport expansion at Heathrow, proposing to get rid of regulations, and ousting the regulator at the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). Labour argues the country’s economic books were worse than expected when they took power. And much more recently, uncertainty over Donald Trump’s willingness to support Ukraine and Nato more widely has seen the UK commit more money to defence. “The world has changed, [we] can see it before our eyes, in a whole number of respects,” Reeves tells me. “[We are seeing] greater instability and insecurity in the world, Europe having to take on a bigger role in our continent for our own defence. ” But to some, Reeves’ willingness to change course raises the question as to what kind of Labour politician she is. The cuts to welfare are at the heart of this. At Prime Minister’s Questions, Sir Keir declared that welfare reform was a “moral issue”, while the veteran left-wing MP Diane Abbott argued there was “nothing moral about cutting the benefits of millions of people”. Reeves sat out much of Labour’s doomed period with Jeremy Corbyn as leader. She was always serious, watchful, with an eye on her party’s and her own future. When she became shadow chancellor she put enormous efforts into schmoozing the city, even if she did once confess she’d instruct her team to sweep up any left over pastries at the end of their business breakfasts. Reeves sees herself as a pragmatic politician, not an ideologue, whether that means increasing taxes in her first budget to fund public services or conversely cutting benefits in this week’s statement. Deborah Mattinson was Sir Keir’s director of strategy up until the election. She argues Reeves is canny and it is her values that make her Labour. “She is very, very savvy. She’s good at looking around corners. “It’s a cliche to say she’s a chess player, but actually it is true that she’s not somebody who deals with the problem that’s right in front of her and leaves it there. She’s somebody who is able to look several moves ahead and always has that slightly longer-term focus. ” Reeves would tell you her politics were made at home, her values that of the south London girl who worked hard and made it to the Bank of England, her economics crafted by study and experience but also the requirements of getting elected – remember she chose politics not economics after all. That, according to Deborah Mattison is key. The decisions Reeves takes are based squarely on ensuring Labour is viewed as economically credible. The argument is that if it isn’t seen as sufficiently credible it won’t be in power and then nothing else really matters. “You can’t win an election if you’re not trusted to run the economy. And Labour has a historical problem that goes back a very, very long way,” she tells me. “After [the election defeat] in 2010, that all dissipated… [and] the Corbyn years, really, really were problematic. So that’s the situation that she inherited and we were no further forward by the time she was appointed shadow chancellor. “By the time we went into the election, she had a double-digit lead over her Tory opposite number. That is one hell of an achievement. ” Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg’s expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you. Like her predecessors in New Labour, Reeves takes the view that the public is less interested in Labour’s economic ideology and more interested in delivering economic prosperity. (Her opponents on the left of the party would argue a clear ideological stance and economic success are not mutually exclusive). However there is one clear division between Reeves and Gordon Brown, chancellor between 1997-2007. Whereas Brown made little secret of his craving to be prime minister, Reeves says she doesn’t have the same goal. “I honestly have no desire whatsoever to do that job. That’s not always the answer you might get from chancellor of the exchequer, but in my case, it’s absolutely true. The job I’ve always wanted is this one. “And I’m very, very lucky because there aren’t many people in politics or in other walks of life that manage to do the job that they’ve always dreamed of perhaps. And for me, I’m doing that today in this job. ” But make no mistake, next week’s Spring Statement is the stuff of nightmares for a Labour chancellor. Her party will hate the cuts to welfare. And at the same time, borrowing and unemployment are ticking up and there is no sign of the economy budging, even though getting it to grow is Labour’s number one mission. Rachel Reeves is the architect and face of her government’s economic plans. If she is indeed feeling the heat, perhaps it’s little surprise.

But read in the context of someone who is taking decisions with big consequences for many, many people’s lives while at the same time being someone who has faced awkward questions about her own job history and CV, this may be Reeves’ way of telling us that she’s feeling the heat. Perhaps the admission came because this was an unusual conversation. We were not under the studio lights but instead in the Treasury itself for the making of a BBC documentary, The Making of a Chancellor, trying to understand the thinking behind the big decisions Reeves takes. Our conversation came a couple of hours after the Labour government had revealed billions of pounds of welfare cuts, most notably stricter tests for personal independence payments (Pips). The aim is to save £5bn by 2030. But there is real anxiety in her party about what she and Sir Keir Starmer are doing. And when I ask the chancellor about these cuts, she prefers to speak about Labour’s broader vision for the economy, instead giving a warning - that this Labour government won’t be able to do what its members and backers might have expected and hand out handsome increases to government departments like its predecessor. “There’s growth, real growth every year actually, in public spending, but not at the levels that we were able to deliver under the last Labour government when the economy was growing much more strongly,” she tells me. “We’ve got to ramp it up and continue to ensure that we’re doing everything we can to lift living standards and in the end that is through growing the economy. We can’t tax and spend our way to higher living standards and better public services. That’s not available in the world we live in today. ” The signalling for the Spring Statement is that there will be no more tax rises and no more increases in government spending, instead a scalpel is set to be taken to some departments. This is the opposite of what she did in the autumn and the opposite of what you’d assume Labour chancellors do. This more guarded approach is in part a response to the uncertainty created by the Trump administration - nobody knows quite what is around the corner. But she has been taking inspiration from across the Atlantic for many years. One of Reeves’ first jobs was working as an economist at the British Embassy in Washington from 2002 to 2003. That era defined her early thinking and she’s still gazing to America for inspiration – Reeves’ first call as chancellor was to Janet Yellen, then her counterpart in DC as treasury secretary in president Joe Biden’s administration. I ask Yellen for her advice to Reeves now, nearly a year on. She says to keep doing the difficult things: “I think she [Reeves] should, you know, stick with the course that she set out and move things, move things forward with, you know, as much speed and commitment as she possibly can. ” But there is tension in Reeves’ approach. Labour is increasing tax, but squeezing some spending. Ministers are rolling back some rules and regulations, but giving workers more rights at work. In effect they are putting the brakes and the accelerator on at the same time. She is aware there is no one thing she can do to suddenly create prosperity. And so how long can people be expected to wait for the change they’ve been promised? Communication is key according to Yellen: “Before you get improvements that are noticeable to voters in infrastructure and job creation, it does take time and so you don’t get the immediate payoff. “And so communication, I think, is very important to make the population understand that this is an approach that requires some patience to see the payoff. But truly, it’s the only way, over the medium term, to boost living standards in major economies. ” Reeves is asking voters to believe that some of the tough choices she is making can be explained, at least in part, by the fact that the world around her has changed in a way she hadn’t anticipated when her party was beginning to prepare its new offer to the public in the aftermath of Labour’s 2019 election defeat. First, a massive £28bn borrowing that had been earmarked to spend on green projects was binned, a necessary response to the economic turmoil under Liz Truss according to Labour - not a view shared by opponents who never thought Labour’s policy credible. Whereas once she said she would be the first green chancellor, now Reeves is signing off airport expansion at Heathrow, proposing to get rid of regulations, and ousting the regulator at the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). Labour argues the country’s economic books were worse than expected when they took power. And much more recently, uncertainty over Donald Trump’s willingness to support Ukraine and Nato more widely has seen the UK commit more money to defence. “The world has changed, [we] can see it before our eyes, in a whole number of respects,” Reeves tells me. “[We are seeing] greater instability and insecurity in the world, Europe having to take on a bigger role in our continent for our own defence. ” But to some, Reeves’ willingness to change course raises the question as to what kind of Labour politician she is. The cuts to welfare are at the heart of this. At Prime Minister’s Questions, Sir Keir declared that welfare reform was a “moral issue”, while the veteran left-wing MP Diane Abbott argued there was “nothing moral about cutting the benefits of millions of people”. Reeves sat out much of Labour’s doomed period with Jeremy Corbyn as leader. She was always serious, watchful, with an eye on her party’s and her own future. When she became shadow chancellor she put enormous efforts into schmoozing the city, even if she did once confess she’d instruct her team to sweep up any left over pastries at the end of their business breakfasts. Reeves sees herself as a pragmatic politician, not an ideologue, whether that means increasing taxes in her first budget to fund public services or conversely cutting benefits in this week’s statement. Deborah Mattinson was Sir Keir’s director of strategy up until the election. She argues Reeves is canny and it is her values that make her Labour. “She is very, very savvy. She’s good at looking around corners. “It’s a cliche to say she’s a chess player, but actually it is true that she’s not somebody who deals with the problem that’s right in front of her and leaves it there. She’s somebody who is able to look several moves ahead and always has that slightly longer-term focus. ” Reeves would tell you her politics were made at home, her values that of the south London girl who worked hard and made it to the Bank of England, her economics crafted by study and experience but also the requirements of getting elected – remember she chose politics not economics after all. That, according to Deborah Mattison is key. The decisions Reeves takes are based squarely on ensuring Labour is viewed as economically credible. The argument is that if it isn’t seen as sufficiently credible it won’t be in power and then nothing else really matters. “You can’t win an election if you’re not trusted to run the economy. And Labour has a historical problem that goes back a very, very long way,” she tells me. “After [the election defeat] in 2010, that all dissipated… [and] the Corbyn years, really, really were problematic. So that’s the situation that she inherited and we were no further forward by the time she was appointed shadow chancellor. “By the time we went into the election, she had a double-digit lead over her Tory opposite number. That is one hell of an achievement. ” Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg’s expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you. Like her predecessors in New Labour, Reeves takes the view that the public is less interested in Labour’s economic ideology and more interested in delivering economic prosperity. (Her opponents on the left of the party would argue a clear ideological stance and economic success are not mutually exclusive). However there is one clear division between Reeves and Gordon Brown, chancellor between 1997-2007. Whereas Brown made little secret of his craving to be prime minister, Reeves says she doesn’t have the same goal. “I honestly have no desire whatsoever to do that job. That’s not always the answer you might get from chancellor of the exchequer, but in my case, it’s absolutely true. The job I’ve always wanted is this one. “And I’m very, very lucky because there aren’t many people in politics or in other walks of life that manage to do the job that they’ve always dreamed of perhaps. And for me, I’m doing that today in this job. ” But make no mistake, next week’s Spring Statement is the stuff of nightmares for a Labour chancellor. Her party will hate the cuts to welfare. And at the same time, borrowing and unemployment are ticking up and there is no sign of the economy budging, even though getting it to grow is Labour’s number one mission. Rachel Reeves is the architect and face of her government’s economic plans. If she is indeed feeling the heat, perhaps it’s little surprise.

    "title": "Update: The slow but steady advance of driverless vehicles",
    "body": "2025/03/21 - It has been recently reported that Mike Johns didn’t expect his return trip from Los Angeles to Scottsdale, Arizona in December to go viral. To get to the airport he booked a driverless taxi and enjoyed a thrill when he jumped in with curious bystanders looking on. But he got much more attention than he bargained for. Mr Johns found himself being driven around and around a car park while those same bystanders looked on. The Waymo ride was not doing what it should and there was no obvious way Mr Johns could fix it - and he had a flight to catch. Mr Johns recorded the experience, a video that went viral almost immediately and was picked up on TV stations around the world, casting fresh public doubt about self-driving cars and how ready they are for real-world passengers. “Why is this happening to me on a Monday morning?” Mr Johns filmed himself asking. Eventually a voice activated inside the car telling him to access the Waymo app to get the vehicle back under control. Waymo which is owned by Alphabet, the parent company of Google, told the BBC that it released a software update almost immediately fixing the problem. The company says its driverless system is “better than humans at avoiding crashes that result in injuries, airbag deployments, and police reports”. Nevertheless, Mr John’s experience is not the first time the company has had to take action. Last year the company recalled more than 600 cars after one hit a street pole. And in May 2024 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) launched a probe into 22 incidents involving Waymo vehicles . The road to a driverless future has also gone awry for rival services. In December, US car giant General Motors closed down its self-driving car subsidiary Cruise. GM attributed the change of strategy to “the considerable time and resources that would be needed to scale the business”. In October 2023, one of its vehicles hit a pedestrian and dragged her for more than 20ft (6m), leaving her seriously injured. Meanwhile, in February of last year, it emerged that Apple’s rumoured self-driving car project was folding. Uber abandoned its own driverless car efforts in 2020. But some big players remain in the race, including Zoox, which is owned by Amazon, as well as chipmaker Nvidia and Elon Musk’s Tesla. Waymo is the leading US player though. It already operates self-driving taxis in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas and is promising to launch soon in Atlanta and Miami, Florida. So why has Waymo succeeded where other efforts, at least in the US, have failed? “Three things - people, money and process,” says Sven Beiker, a lecturer at Stanford Graduate School of Business, and managing director of Silicon Valley Mobility, an automotive consultancy. He points out that over the years Waymo has employed some of the leading figures in autonomous vehicle engineering, it has the financial weight of Google-owner Alphabet behind it, and has become thorough in its approach. “They’ve come around to really playing by the book, to be a good steward of processes… working with regulators to make sure what they deploy is safe. ” So what’s next? Regions with good weather are likely to see driverless services first says Philipp Kampshoff, global co-leader of Automotive and Assembly Practice at the consultancy giant McKinsey. That would include southern US states like Texas and Florida, where Waymo already has plans. “Robo-taxis still operate much better in good weather conditions. They still, for the most part, struggle in heavy snow,” Mr Kampshoff says. He also points out that the batteries perform better in warmer conditions, which is particularly important for driverless cars that need a lot of energy to power on board computing. “Bringing this all together, in the second part of the 2020s, you will see one city after the other being unlocked and then scaling within these cities,” he says. It will be a slow process. “It’s actually quite a labour intensive process to roll out this technology, which includes a fair amount of human driving,” says Mr Beiker. “You need to drive those vehicles through the streets where you want to deploy them, and you need to drive them over and over again, and you need to, to some extent, manually edit the data,” he adds. And the whole process could also be held up by safety concerns. “This is only going to happen if we’re not running into major accidents. The moment major accidents are going to happen, a lot of these operations are going to be shut down,” says Mr Kampshoff. For those working on self-driving trucks, safety is arguably on even bigger worry. “Safety is the number one concern that we work on,” says David Liu, the chief executive of Plus, which makes driverless software for trucks and works with global companies such as Amazon, Hyundai, Volkswagen and Scania. “Autonomous trucks and autonomous vehicles, need to be much safer than average human driven vehicle,” says Mr Liu. “Human drivers are great, but not flawless. Most of the accidents we get ourselves into are due to driver inattentiveness. And we don’t have that issue with technology,” Mr Liu explains. “A robo-taxi mostly runs within cities in low-speed environments, while trucks are typically run on highways at higher speed. “So we do need to put in different set of technology to be able to see more clearly around the trucks and be able to handle a longer braking distance, for instance. ” To see into the driverless future it might be worth watching developments in China. In the city of Wuhan more than 500 driverless cars are being operated by the company Baidu. Across the country driverless cars are reported to be operating in 16 cities and being tested by 19 manufacturers. “There’s definitely more competition… there are four or five companies that are very similar to Waymo,” says Mr Beiker who is currently working on a study of robo-taxi deployments around the world, sponsored by Sweden’s innovation agency Vinnova. Back in Scottsdale, Mr Johns reflects on his experience and the rollout of autonomous vehicles. “One big thing is that we’re all a part of a paid experiment. At the end of the day, what they’re doing is fixing it as they go, per city. And that’s a problem. ” "

At the end of the day, what they’re doing is fixing it as they go, per city. And that’s a problem. ” "

    "body": "2025/03/19 - It has been recently reported that Matt Hancock has defended government deals to buy personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic, saying the country was in a “desperate situation” at the time. In a bad-tempered session at the Covid inquiry, the former health secretary repeatedly criticised the line of questioning describing it as “naive”, “hostile” and “inappropriate”. He said he was “not at all surprised” when a so-called VIP lane for PPE suppliers with a political connection was set up, describing it as “standard practice”. At one point, the chairwoman of the inquiry, Baroness Hallett, intervened, telling Hancock it was her job to learn lessons for any future pandemic. Hancock was appearing for the fifth time at the Covid inquiry, which is now investigating the purchase and distribution of £15bn of PPE in the pandemic, along with testing kits, ventilators and other pieces of medical equipment. He defended a public “call to arms” made at a Downing Street news conference on 10 April 2020 for more UK suppliers of PPE to come forward. The inquiry has heard from previous witnesses, including the government’s former chief commercial officer Sir Gareth Rhys Williams, that the appeal was counterproductive, leading to a large number of approaches which threatened to overwhelm the system. “We were radically short of PPE [at the time] and the country was about to run out at a national level,” Hancock told the inquiry. “No-one has testified that the call to arms led to anything other than more PPE… So I stand by that. ” The former health secretary was then asked about the High Priority Lane, or VIP lane, which was set up by officials in the Department of Health in England to help manage offers by prioritising those referred by an MP, member of the House of Lords or senior civil servant. Hancock said he was not involved in designing the system, which he said had made him the target of an “enormous amount of conspiracy theories”. The inquiry commissioned an expert report from Prof Albert Sanchez-Graells, a professor of law at the University of Bristol, which was critical of the approach and found no evidence of similar prioritisation in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, or other countries around the world. “It’s fine having academics write papers about this stuff… but you’ve got to understand what it was like [at the time],” said Hancock. “The pressure to save lives was intense, but so was the reality that high-quality offers would be sent through to senior decision-makers, and you had to have a process for dealing with that. ” He said that other countries would have had their own systems for prioritising offers for PPE and medical equipment in different ways. Hancock was later asked about a contract awarded to a firm run by Alex Bourne, who owned a pub in his West Suffolk constituency, to make vials for Covid testing. Emails show Hancock passed on communications from Mr Bourne to the then health minister Lord Bethell, describing his analysis of the wider testing system as a “very interesting critique” from a “very impressive guy”. In questioning, Hancock said he acted with “impeccable behaviour” at the time, and accused the inquiry’s chief counsel Richard Wald KC of cherry-picking a “couple of messages” that have the “most tabloid interest”. He said the inquiry had followed a “wholly naive” line of questioning by ignoring the reality of the situation at the time, while making “terribly pejorative” statements that were “totally inappropriate”. At the conclusion of his evidence, Baroness Hallett told Hancock that he “was not the first and I’m sure won’t be the last witness to think the inquiry is all about criticising people”. “My aim is to investigate what happened, to explore matters of public concern, to get people to answer on those areas, and to try to come up with recommendations that will save lives,” she added.

    "title": "Update: Disasters spur investment in flood and fire risk tech",
    "body": "2025/03/18 - Experts revealed that When Storm Babet hit the town of Trowell in Nottingham in 2023, Claire Sneddon felt confident her home would not be affected. After all, when she bought the property in 2021, she was told by the estate agent that a previous flood the year before, which had reached but not affected the property, was a once-in-a-lifetime event, and that flooding measures to protect the properties on the cul-de-sac would be put in place. However, when Storm Babet tore through the UK two years later, Ms Sneddon’s home flooded after several days of rain. “We knew there would be water on the cul-de-sac but no one expected it to flood internally again. However, water entered the property for five hours,” she says. “It reached to the top of the skirting boards. We had to have all the flooring, woodwork and lower kitchen replaced, which took nearly 12 months. ” Their final insurance bill was around £45,000. She says they were fortunate to have qualified for a government scheme providing affordable insurance for homeowners in areas of high-flood risk. Although she loves the area, her neighbours and the house, the weather is now a cause of stress. “We constantly worry about the weather, if it is going to rain longer than a couple of days, or there is a named storm. “We do wish we had taken more steps to understand the risk. The survey showed that the property was in a medium flood zone, but there wasn’t much detail other than flood zone maps. ” Climate change is increasing the likelihood and intensity of natural disasters such as floods, wildfires and hurricanes. While it might be too late for Ms Sneddon and other homeowners, new tools are being developed to help people and companies assess climate risk. Last December, the UK Environment Agency updated its National Flood Risk Assessment (NaFRA), showing current and future flood risk from rivers, the sea and surface water for England. It used its own data alongside that of local authorities and climate data from the Met Office. It also brought up to date the National Coastal Erosion Risk Map (NCERM). They were both last updated in 2018 and 2017 respectively. The new NaFRA data shows as many as 6. 3 million properties in England are in areas at risk of flooding from rivers, the sea or surface water, and with climate change this could increase to around eight million by 2050. “We have spent the last few years transforming our understanding of flood and coastal erosion risk in England, drawing on the best available data… as well as improved modelling and technological advances,” says Julie Foley, director of flood risk strategy at the Environment Agency. “When we account for the latest climate projections, one in four properties could be in areas at risk of flooding by the middle of the century. ” The Environment Agency plans to launch a portal where users can check their long-term flood risk. Similar resources exist for Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales through the ABI. “We can no longer rely on historical data,” says Lukky Ahmed, co-founder of Climate X. The London-based climate risk firm offers a digital twin of the Earth, which simulates different extreme weather events and their potential impact on properties, infrastructure and assets under different emissions scenarios. It combines artificial intelligence with physics-based climate models. “While many climate models might tell you how much rainfall to expect, they don’t say what happens when that water hits the ground,” he says. “Our models simulate, for example, what happens when the water hits, where it travels and what the impact of the flooding will be. ” While banks and other lenders are testing their product, property companies are currently using their services when considering new developments. “They log into our platform and identify locations and existing building stock and in return they receive risk rating and severity metrics tied to hazards,” says Mr Ahmed. Many parts of the world have much more extreme weather than the UK. In the US in January, devastating wild fires tore through parts of Los Angeles. Meanwhile Hurricane Milton, which landed last October, is likely to be one of the costliest hurricanes to hit west Florida. To help insurers manage those costs, New York-based Faura analyses the resilience of homes and commercial buildings. “We look at the different elements of a property to understand how likely it is to survive and pinpoint resilience and survivability of a property,” says Faura co-founder Valkyrie Holmes. “We tell companies and homeowners whether their property will still be standing after a disaster, not just whether a disaster will happen in an area,” he adds. Faura bases its assessments on satellite and aerial imagery and data from surveys and disaster reports. “Insurance companies technically have the data to be able to do this but have not build out the models to quantify it,” says Mr Holmes. Other services are popping up for homebuyers. For the properties it markets, US firm Redfin, estimates the percentage chance of natural disasters, such as flooding and wildfires, occurring up to the next 30 years across each property. “If people are looking at two homes with the same layout in the same neighbourhood, then climate risk will make or break [their decision],” says Redfin chief economist Daryl Fairweather. As for Ms Sneddon, following her personal experience, she now works for flood risk company The FPS Group. “Flood risk is only going to get worse over the coming years so it is essential to find out as much as you can about the flood risk to a property,” she advises. “Flooding has a huge impact on communities and mental health. You are supposed to feel safe in your home, it shouldn’t be a place of worry and anxiety. ” "

    "title": "Update: Labour's plan for benefits throws up a bigger dilemma",
    "body": "2025/03/17 - According to new developments, In the next 24 hours and then over the following fortnight up until the Spring Statement, the government is going to talk a lot about a broken welfare system that is failing the people who use it, the economy and taxpayers. Taking a tough call on fixing it goes against the instincts of much of the Labour Party and has already sparked an internal backlash that could rise to ministerial level, as well as protests. The government is making two key related judgements. The first is that the country cannot afford to sustain recent ballooning increases in the health-related benefit bill and caseload, in particular for mental illness. At the same time, it will argue that a job is the best medicine. Underlying this is an assumption that a health-related benefits system that was built-up to deal with industrial injuries can’t apply to the post-pandemic service economy workforce. The net result is likely to be significant changes to Personal Independence Payments, aiming to reduce eligibility for the highest levels of payments, especially among those of working age with mental illness. In addition, there will be a levelling of the generosity of the health component of Universal Credit. This will save billions of pounds, and about a billion of that will be reinvested in trying to help get those capable of part-time work some help for a partial return. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is rolling in real-time data. “Cluster analysis maps” reveal to ministers exactly who is claiming out of work benefits and where they are. As the numbers continue to increase, the data is being cut by sector, postcode, age and type of illness. Every pattern is being analysed. The idea was that the data would firstly offer the government insight into how it could make billions of pounds of cuts to a rapidly growing bill in order to help the Chancellor meet her self-imposed government borrowing rules. Secondly, it was meant to point to more fundamental reforms to welfare, also designed to temper the same ballooning rise in the costs of dealing with ill health among the working population. The data has thrown up answers. That poor mental health is driving the rise in claimants is clear. To a lesser extent, so too is the role that raising the state pension age has played, with many thousands who would previously have been retired now claiming health-related benefits. But it has also thrown up a major question too: does cutting welfare to incentivise people to work more hours in fact do the opposite - nudging them out of the workforce altogether and ultimately increasing the benefit bill? If this is the case - and it is by no means a universally accepted interpretation of what has happened - then the question is whether further cuts could in fact increase the numbers claiming? And should Labour instead invest in getting people back into work? When I visited a job centre in Birmingham alongside the Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall in the Autumn, I was taken aback by how the work coaches were talking as much about health as about work. “There’s a lot of mental health, depression and anxiety,” Qam told me. GPs have reported that their surgery time is dominated by trying to work out whether their patients are “fit for work”. Roughly 11 million fit notes are issued every year in England alone, with 93% assessing the patient as “not fit for work”. That has doubled over a decade. In the latest quarter, 44% were for 5 weeks or more absence. From that pool of growing in-work sickness, a significant proportion ends up on some form of incapacity benefits. The Treasury’s bill for health and disability benefits, which was £28bn in the year before the pandemic, is now £52bn a year. It is forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to hit £70bn by the end of the decade. The pure financial aim here is to “bend the curve” down to nearer £60bn in that period. This means restricting both the generosity and eligibility of some - or all of such - payments. It could require a wholesale cash freeze so that benefits do not rise with inflation, for example, or the abolition of entire categories of recipients. An Institute for Fiscal Studies report published last week showed that wider measures of mental ill health have rocketed since the pandemic. Between 2002 and 2024, the number of 16-64-year-olds claiming disability benefits for mental or behavioural health conditions increased from 360,000 to 1. 28 million. Every day in 2023 there were 10 extra “deaths of despair” (defined as deaths from alcohol, drugs or suicide) in England and Wales than the average between 2015 and 2019. Average sickness absence rates across the whole economy remained structurally higher than pre-pandemic. Of particular concern is how this affects young people. In a recent report DWP adviser Prof Paul Gregg points to the “incredibly low” chances of sustained returns to the workforce once a person has been on incapacity benefits for two years. About two fifths of new incapacity benefit claimants under 25 came directly from education. The latest DWP analysis shows these trends are now closely related to broader socio-economic vulnerabilities such as limited education and also with precarious sectors such as retail and hospitality. The question that remains is whether so many people really are more sick - and what role (if any) is played by the reduction in stigma around mental health. But then there is the question of how to address it. Another major factor is that rise in the state pension age, which the DWP calculates, resulted in 89,000 older workers instead claiming health-related benefits. However, the sharp increase in claimants of such benefits since the pandemic is not only attributable to ageing populations or increasing mental health diagnoses. Research suggests there are significant systemic and policy-driven causes. At its heart the problem is perceived to be that the current welfare structure has become overly binary, failing to accommodate a growing demographic who should be able to do at least a bit of work. This rigidity - what ministers refer to as a “hard boundary” - inadvertently pushes individuals towards declaring complete unfitness for work, and can lead to total dependence on welfare, particularly Universal Credit Health (UC Health), rather than facilitating a gradual transition back into employment. This has been bad for the economy, for employers, terrible for the public finances, and deeply concerning for the career prospects of individuals. History helps here. Health-related benefits are often a disguised form of unemployment. The caseload for incapacity benefits (which include not just UC Health but previous incarnations) since the 1970s shows the UK heading for a record of one in 12 adults of working age in receipt. But this is not the first such build-up. It happened in the late 1980s when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister, and it was reversed in the early 2000s under New Labour. The launch in 1986 of Restart Programme, a forerunner to JobSeekers Allowance modelled on Ronald Reagan’s policies in the US, helped return many claimants to the workforce but also pushed a staggering number into incapacity claims. Over the decade and a half of this policy, there was a 1. 6 million increase in people in receipt of the benefit. But at the time this migration from claimant unemployment into incapacity was apparently a deliberate strategy, as it helped deal with headlines about “three million unemployed”. The government has not yet published its analysis on the jobs market, but Prof Gregg’s early thinking was made clear in a report for the Health Foundation. He argued that, historically, the welfare system responded effectively through a middle ground that allowed individuals to combine part-time work with partial welfare benefits. He puts this down to reforms introduced in the early 2000s, such as tax credits. This is essentially the crystallisation of Iain Duncan Smith’s critique of then chancellor George Osborne’s welfare cuts of 2016. He told me at the time that they were “deeply unfair” on working people and the vision of a proper welfare-to-work scheme “could not be repeatedly salami-sliced”. Some argue that those reforms created a situation where individuals, unable to sustain full-time work, gravitate towards more generous health-based welfare program. Crucially, claims began to rise in 2018. At the DWP ministers have tried to research the reasons behind the increase in caseload - and found that about a third of the increase can be explained as the predictable consequence of policy or of demographics. With an ongoing flow of new claimants arriving in the system (nearly half a million in the last financial year) the onus is now on finding a prevention rather than a cure. And this is where it becomes tricky - one suggestion involves eliminating the current welfare trap by reintroducing intermediate support for part-time work. However, that requires extra funding, as well as a way of providing more personalised job searches and better mental health support. Another option is passing responsibilities to employers. In the Netherlands, employers bear significant responsibilities and financial costs if they fail to adequately support employees facing health challenges. In the early 2000s, the Dutch also had very high levels of incapacity but they now report employment rates of 83%. The structure of the jobs market in the UK makes that challenging to replicate - for example there are more insecure zero hours contracts. And given that businesses feel under pressure from National Insurance rises and a slow economy, could they really be cajoled into helping? The questions arising from the data will matter for the economy, for the public finances, our health, and young people’s careers and livelihoods, at a time of considerable change. Fundamentally, it is a question of what the benefit system is for, at a time when illness is being redefined, and when the trends are, frankly, scary. Then there is the question of whether the public wants to pay even higher taxes in the hope of delivering long-term gain. Welfare-to-work programs can pay for themselves eventually, but the Government feels it needs to book faster cuts. That’s because all of this is in the context of what “fiscal headroom” the government did have against the Chancellor’s self-imposed borrowing targets being wiped out since the Trump shock to the world economy, the Budget and the announcements of extra European defence spending. But government insiders are at pains to argue that the primary motivation for any cuts is not regaining the extra room for manoeuvre. “We don’t need the OBR to tell us that we need to fix welfare to get people back to work. We don’t need the OBR to tell us we need to make the NHS more productive. And we don’t need the OBR to tell us that the taxpayer should be getting more value for money,” a source told me. “Headroom or no headroom the Chancellor is determined to push through the change we need to make Britain more secure and prosperous. ” Ultimately, the economic imperative is clear - to bring a cohort of young people suffering a combination of mental ill health and joblessness back into work. And the government believes there is no way of doing this without, at least at first, hurting the incomes of ill people. There is going to be quite the backlash from disability charities, and in turn from backbench Labour MPs. That’s why it’s no exaggeration to say this month’s explosive row about welfare will come to define this Government.

    "title": "Update: Mone accuses Covid inquiry of 'cover-up'",
    "body": "2025/03/13 - Here’s what you need to know: Baroness Mone and her husband Doug Barrowman have accused the Covid inquiry of an “establishment cover-up” after their second attempt to be given an official role in the inquiry was rejected. The couple claimed they were the targets of a “politically motivated witch hunt” after the inquiry’s chairwoman, Baroness Hallett, refused their application to be made “core participants”. PPE Medpro, a firm led by Mr Barrowman, was awarded government contracts worth more than £200m after Baroness Mone recommended it to ministers. If approved, the official status would have allowed the couple to access inquiry documents, make statements and apply to ask questions of witnesses. Baroness Hallett first rejected their approach in February, saying it came 468 days after the deadline for applications, and she did not accept they had a large enough role “in the matters to be investigated by the inquiry”. She had previously said her main focus is on the approach of ministers and the government, rather than Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) suppliers. The Covid inquiry is conducting four weeks of hearings looking at deals to buy £15bn of PPE during Covid. The National Crime Agency (NCA) has been investigating PPE Medpro since May 2021 over suspected criminal offences committed in the procurement process. To date no charges have been brought and the Crown Prosecution Service has not been instructed in the case. Baroness Mone, 53, and Mr Barrowman, 59, have both denied wrongdoing. A special inquiry hearing about the company will take place behind closed doors next week after Baroness Hallett said she was satisfied there was a risk of prejudice to the ongoing NCA investigation if “sensitive evidence” was made public. In a joint statement, Baroness Mone and her husband said the decision to hear evidence in private was “a blatant betrayal of transparency and justice” and accused the NCA of waging “a ruthless campaign” against them. The couple said: “While the inquiry refused to exclude PPE Medpro, it handed the NCA the power to dictate the proceedings behind a wall of secrecy, ensuring that only their version of events is heard – while we are denied the right to defend ourselves. ” In a social media post, Baroness Mone said she did not realise that the company would be “specifically profiled” by the inquiry until the end of February. “Until then, it was understood that discussions were general, covering overall PPE procurement, not targeting any individual entity,” she added. The couple’s statement was released after their second approach to be made core participants was rejected. Baroness Hallett said allowing the application to proceed would have led to a “further diversion of resources” and have caused “significant disruption” to the inquiry’s timetable. "

    "body": "2025/03/13 - It has been recently reported that Baroness Mone and her husband Doug Barrowman have accused the Covid inquiry of an “establishment cover-up” after their second attempt to be given an official role in the inquiry was rejected. The couple claimed they were the targets of a “politically motivated witch hunt” after the inquiry’s chairwoman, Baroness Hallett, refused their application to be made “core participants”. PPE Medpro, a firm led by Mr Barrowman, was awarded government contracts worth more than £200m after Baroness Mone recommended it to ministers. If approved, the official status would have allowed the couple to access inquiry documents, make statements and apply to ask questions of witnesses.

    "title": "Update: Michael Gove denies trying to circumvent Dyson ventilator checks",
    "body": "2025/03/11 - It has been recently reported that Michael Gove has told the Covid inquiry it was “ludicrous” to suggest he tried to force through a deal for a new ventilator made by the electronics giant Dyson without proper safety checks. Emails show a senior official at the health watchdog warned that the former cabinet office minister was trying to “circumvent the regulatory process” in March 2020. Messages between staff at the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said Mr Gove did not “appreciate the level of risk involved” and was working to a “totally unrealistic” timescale. A provisional order for 10,000 machines was placed at the time, but the deal was scrapped after Dyson failed to win regulatory approval. No public money was spent on the prototype. Dyson said it never intended to make a profit from the venture and wrote off around £20m in research and development costs. In March 2020, as Covid was spreading across northern Italy, there was a frantic attempt by health authorities to get hold of ventilators to help patients breathe. The NHS had between 6,000 and 8,000 in stock but modelling suggested it needed 30,000 by the end of June and 90,000 by November to cope with a predicted influx of patients. On 16 March 2020, the government launched the ‘Ventilator Challenge’ - a drive to encourage domestic UK suppliers to develop new machines or modify existing designs. The project was overseen by cabinet office officials and involved the MHRA, which helped draw up initial specifications and squeezed an approval process that would usually take 18-24 months into just weeks. A number of major companies were involved, including the carmakers Ford and McLaren, and the electronics giant Dyson. At the time, the company’s founder Sir James Dyson held a number of telephone conversations with government officials, including the then Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The Covid inquiry was shown WhatsApp messages then sent between ministers and government advisers suggesting Sir James was concerned about the pace of project. On 20 March 2020, Mr Johnson wrote that “Dyson [was] freaking” and called for “Action this day”. Minutes later ex health secretary Matt Hancock replied, “I have also received the same. I will talk to Dyson and Michael [Gove] and sort it. ” Asked about the deal at the inquiry, the government’s then chief commercial officer, Sir Gareth Rhys Williams, said it was the only example he could recall in the pandemic where he was asked to put a contract in place “against commercial guidance”. Five days later, on 25 March, Boris Johnson wrote another WhatsApp message to the same group saying that: “Dyson has a ventilator ready to go… It’s safe, effective and loses less oxygen. Rhys Williams has blocked it under the misapprehension that oxygen passes through the motor. That is total b**cks. ” He accused officials of “fiddling while Rome burns” and added: “Sorry but I’m on a mission. Dyson knows what he’s doing and won’t risk his global brand reputation delivering dodgy ventilators. ” Sir Gareth said, at that point, the Dyson prototype pushed air from a fan directly into the lungs of patients, something that could cause safety concerns. The Dyson team did subsequently “fix” that part of the design, he added. Later on 25 March, Sir Gareth wrote to Sir John Manzoni, a top civil servant in the cabinet office, saying that Michael Gove was “INSISTENT we place an order with Dyson… contingent on passing clinical and passing MHRA approvals. ” A provisional £100,000 order was then placed for the Dyson prototypes, and an email from Michael Gove’s private office set out a number of actions that needed be taken quickly including: “The MHRA and Sir Gareth Rhys Williams to ensure by the end of Friday, [that] the Dyson product has been tested and approved by MHRA… [and] the final product has started to be manufactured. ” The following day Graeme Tunbridge, the director of devices for the MHRA, wrote to colleagues warning that Michael Gove was “keen to press forward with Dyson’s proposal to a timescale that is totally unrealistic. ” He added that Mr Gove “did not appreciate the level of risk involved in the manufacture and use of ventilators” and “wanted to circumvent the expedited regulatory process that has been put in place”. “MHRA are doing everything we can to support this but absolutely will not cut any corners when it comes to the issues of critical patient safety,” he wrote. Giving evidence to the inquiry, Mr Gove denied he had tried to pressure the MHRA in any way, or that the focus on Dyson meant resources could not be devoted to bids from other companies. “Just imagine the situation, if you will, a minister – Matt Hancock, I, Boris Johnson – says we want to have a potentially lethal machine in hospitals deliberately so that we can meet an arbitrary deadline. It’s inconceivable,” he said. The former minister said that the Dyson prototype ultimately “did not get through testing” and “whenever confronted with brute facts about safety or otherwise, I would always accept them. ” He denied that his private office was instructing the regulator to approve the device saying the language used was simply “shorthand for ‘we would hope that it had been tested and if tested satisfactorily [then] approved by the MHRA to that timescale’”. In the end the government said the Ventilator Challenge helped scale up the production of three existing models, and approved one new design by the medical devices firm Penlon. In total, an extra 14,000 devices were delivered over three months, fewer than the government originally planned for as doctors identified other ways of treating the most severe Covid cases. In a statement, Dyson said Sir James Dyson responded to a personal call from Boris Johnson to “develop and make a medical-grade ventilator in 30 days during the national emergency”. “Far from receiving any commercial benefit, there was significant commercial cost to Dyson which diverted 450 engineers away from commercial projects,” added a company spokesperson. “Uniquely amongst the many businesses involved, [Sir] James Dyson did not seek payment for any of the £20m the company spent on the project – rather this was its contribution to the national effort to save lives. ” "

    "title": "Update: Charity's wellness sessions take to the road",
    "body": "2025/03/09 - Here’s what you need to know: A charity is taking support services on the road with its “wheels of wellness” van ahead of the opening of a permanent site. The iCan organisation offers help on a range of fitness and wellbeing issues and is set to join a number of partner groups based in a former bank in Whitehaven town centre to be known as Hope Haven. Ahead of its opening later this year, some activities have gone mobile in an attempt to help “hard-to-reach” areas and people. Community engagement co-ordinator Phil Stout said it had already proved successful. A number of sessions have been held in Gosforth over recent weeks with further ones to come elsewhere in Copeland including Seascale, Calder Bridge and Lamplugh. “It’s all about getting out into the community and speaking to people, especially in hard-to-reach places,” Mr Stout said. “We’ve done research around transport links and lack of mobility has been an issue because some people don’t have buses or trains nearby or their own cars. “We call the van the ‘wheels of wellness’ and it’s very visual. It catches people’s attention and they come and ask what we’re doing. ” The sessions, so far staged within a village hall, have included activities such as mini-trampolining, chair-based activities and walking football. Many of the participants were women aged between 60 and 80, who Mr Stout said were keen to play football “because they hadn’t been allowed to years ago at school”. Six drop-in sessions focusing on mental health are also being held at Whitehaven’s Senhouse Centre this month and next ahead of the opening of the Hope Haven hub on King Street.

    "body": "2025/03/09 - According to new developments, A charity is taking support services on the road with its “wheels of wellness” van ahead of the opening of a permanent site. The iCan organisation offers help on a range of fitness and wellbeing issues and is set to join a number of partner groups based in a former bank in Whitehaven town centre to be known as Hope Haven. Ahead of its opening later this year, some activities have gone mobile in an attempt to help “hard-to-reach” areas and people. Community engagement co-ordinator Phil Stout said it had already proved successful. A number of sessions have been held in Gosforth over recent weeks with further ones to come elsewhere in Copeland including Seascale, Calder Bridge and Lamplugh. “It’s all about getting out into the community and speaking to people, especially in hard-to-reach places,” Mr Stout said. “We’ve done research around transport links and lack of mobility has been an issue because some people don’t have buses or trains nearby or their own cars. “We call the van the ‘wheels of wellness’ and it’s very visual. It catches people’s attention and they come and ask what we’re doing. ” The sessions, so far staged within a village hall, have included activities such as mini-trampolining, chair-based activities and walking football. Many of the participants were women aged between 60 and 80, who Mr Stout said were keen to play football “because they hadn’t been allowed to years ago at school”. Six drop-in sessions focusing on mental health are also being held at Whitehaven’s Senhouse Centre this month and next ahead of the opening of the Hope Haven hub on King Street.

    "title": "Update: Doctors back total ban on smacking kids in England",
    "body": "2025/03/06 - Here’s what you need to know: Leading child doctors have joined calls for a complete ban on smacking children in England, saying there is no evidence it has any positive effect on their wellbeing. Currently, smacking is unlawful in England, except in cases where it amounts to a “reasonable punishment”. Now the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) wants that legal defence to be removed, using an amendment to a law which is currently making its way through Parliament. The Department for Education said the government had no plans to change the law on smacking, but that it was committed to giving every child the best start in life. Prof Andrew Rowland, RCPCH officer for child protection, said: “Now is the time for this Victorian-era punishment to go. ” If enough MPs backed the amendment to the Children’s Wellbeing and Schools Bill, tabled by Labour MP Jess Asato in January, then the defence of smacking as a “reasonable punishment” would be completely outlawed in England. Currently, the situation on smacking children is different depending on where you are in the UK. In Scotland and Wales, corporal - or physical - punishment is illegal, but in England and Northern Ireland the “reasonable punishment” defence still stands. In England, the defence is included in the Children Act of 2004, but smacking children has been permitted by law since 1860. Scotland was the first UK country to ban corporal punishment in November 2020, followed by Wales in March 2022. Prof Rowland said there were 67 countries around the world which had already adopted smacking bans, with a further 20 committing to do so. The government said it was “looking closely” at the changes made in Scotland and Wales, but had no plans to legislate on smacking at this stage. A spokesperson said the bill in its current form represented the “single biggest piece of child protection legislation in a generation”. “This government has prioritised significant reform of the children’s social care system, driving better child protection and information sharing between education, health and social workers to stop vulnerable children falling through the cracks,” they added. Parents at a baby sensory group in Sale, Greater Manchester, told the BBC they were all against smacking children, but some were unsure about whether it was right for the government to intervene. Mum Leanne Casey, said parents “should be able to discipline how they see fit”, but added: “I don’t agree with smacking children though, so if a ban is what it takes then I’d agree that is what you need to do. ” Dad Oli Harrison said he would “never intervene” in another person’s parenting methods, but added that a ban would “probably be beneficial” to avoid it being seen as a “grey area”. When looking at populations as a whole, Prof Rowland said physical punishment “undoubtedly harms children’s health”. He said there were no scientific studies which provided robust evidence that smacking had any positive effect on children’s wellbeing. Calls for a ban on smacking intensified after the death of 10-year-old Sara Sharif. Sara was murdered in August 2023 after a “campaign of torture” by her father and stepmother which lasted for two years. Her father, who had fled to Pakistan after the murder, had phoned police in England claiming he had “legally punished” Sara before her death. It is unlawful in England to assault a child causing actual or grievous bodily harm, or cruelty, but Prof Rowland said academic studies had shown children who were punished physically were at an increased risk of serious physical assault. He said a complete ban on smacking would make it easier for the authorities to “draw a line and say there are never any circumstances involved where physical punishment of children is ever legal”. Other organisations, including the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, have also backed the amendment. Joanna Barrett, from the charity, said smacking had been associated with “depression, anxiety, increased aggression, and antisocial behaviour”. She said a legal change was needed “urgently”, adding that “right now we know physical punishment remains a part of childhood for too many young people in England”. Not everyone agrees. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live’s Nicky Campbell on Thursday, Simon Calvert from campaign group Be Reasonable challenged the doctors’ calls. He argued that unreasonable chastisement, such as beating a child, was already illegal, and voiced concerns the proposal could mean “a mum tapping a tot on the back of the hand” faces criminal prosecution. Lynn Perry, chief executive of the Barnardo’s children’s charity, said: “No violence against children is acceptable. And yet children continue to face less legal protection against physical assault than adults. ” Additional reporting by Hope Rhodes and Hayley Clarke "

    "title": "Update: I was effectively homeless after getting sacked - Stoney",
    "body": "2025/03/02 - Let’s dive into the details: I was effectively homeless after getting sacked - Stoney Casey Stoney was only meant to be returning to England temporarily last June for a funeral when she found herself stuck in the country, along with her family, unable to go back to their home in California. Upon landing on British soil, the former England captain was informed by her agent that she had been sacked as head coach of NWSL club San Diego Wave. “When I got fired, it terminated our visas with immediate effect whilst I was in the UK, pretty much rendering me and my partner homeless, with three children,” she tells BBC Sport. As she had been outside of the US when her sacking happened and her visa was dependent on her work, she had no way of returning without finding another sponsor. That led to a turbulent few months for the 42-year-old, who was left questioning whether she even wanted to keep working in football. Now the former Manchester United boss is taking on international management for the first time in her new role as Canada coach, and is finally back to doing what she loves - getting out on the training pitch and working with her players. Former England defender Casey Stoney (right) joined newly formed club San Diego Wave in June 2021 Stoney, who won 130 caps for England and captained Great Britain at the 2012 Olympics, had been in charge of San Diego Wave for nearly three years after resigning as Manchester United manager in 2021. The NWSL club were a new franchise when she became head coach and she led them to third place and then top spot during the first two seasons. They twice reached the semi-finals of the end-of-season play-offs, which crowns the league’s champions, but her third season had not continued on the same trajectory with just three wins after 14 games. She saw the job as a long-term project. She had experienced a painful spell apart from her partner, Megan, and three children - twins Teddy and Tilly and youngest child Willow - when she first moved to the US but they had eventually resolved their visa issues, enabling them to be reunited, and set up their family home in California. “It took 22 months to get them out there, we were 22 months apart, we weren’t even out there a year [together] and I lost my job,” she says. “If I’m honest, I didn’t think I deserved to lose my job either, so that made it even tougher, with the successes that we had, we just had a little dip. It wasn’t even anything major. “So to be treated in that way, after everything that had been done and sacrificed and everything that had been achieved, it was really, really hard to swallow on a personal level, but it was more what happened to my family. “I have three young children, they were nine and six at the time, they didn’t have a home. So that, for me, is inexcusable to do to a family. ” The day her children were supposed to be back at school in August in San Diego following their summer break came and went, so Stoney took on home-schooling herself. It was a period she describes as “one of the hardest times in my life”. She says: “It did make me question if I wanted to stay in the game because if the game chews you up and spits you out like that, after everything that we had sacrificed to be there, and after what I had achieved in a short space of time, and what we had achieved as a club, it did make me question the game. “I got offers quite quickly after the announcement and I said no to all of them, whether they were right or wrong, because I wanted to take time. I needed to make sure I sorted our lives out. “My priority was my family [and] how do we get back to San Diego. ” Casey Stoney, whose former clubs include Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea, walked out to a guard of honour with her three children before her final match as a player in February 2018 It took four months for the family to get new visas, based on Stoney’s consultancy work, enabling them to return to the US and “our lives”. They had relied on family in England to provide a roof over their heads in the interim. “[The children] missed two and a half months of education. They missed a lot of their life during that time. ” She also had a lot of time for self-reflection and took the opportunity to visit different clubs as she reassessed her priorities. “It just helped me get to a point where I was ready to get back in [to football] and I was very keen to get back in. At first I couldn’t have thought of anything less that I wanted to be involved in and it just took a bit of time to heal the wounds. ” The ex-England defender was spotted at her former club Arsenal, who were looking for a replacement for Jonas Eidevall while she was out of work, while other Women’s Super League clubs also had vacancies during that time. But then along came the Canada job. At first she was unsure whether she wanted to move into international football and leave behind what she “loves”, which is working with players day to day. Yet the initial conversations proved appealing and she found herself in a lengthy interview process lasting some three to four months. “I really liked that it was extensive,” she says. “It meant that their hiring process was thorough. I got to interview them as much as they interviewed me. ” That included speaking to the manager of the men’s team, former Leeds boss Jesse Marsch, who had already made the transition from club to the international game. And she was impressed â by the organisation’s leadership led by chief executive Kevin Blue, the culture of the team, and the talent of the players, plus Canada were happy for her to continue living in California if she took the role. “When I interviewed for this job, Kevin was very clear that I didn’t have to move,” she said. “That’s been really, really beneficial for us as a family. I don’t think people understand when you take on a head coach role, and I understand people say you’re in a privileged position, but it’s the impact on your family it has. “I had young children that just didn’t understand what was going on [when she was sacked] - lots of tears, lots of heartache, that I felt like I’d contributed to that, which was difficult. “There were jobs open in the UK at the time when I didn’t have a job. There were some I would have been interested in, some I wouldn’t have been interested in, but as soon as I got involved in this process it became clear I was really interested in this [and] I was only committed to one thing. ” Casey Stoney took charge of Canada for the first time in February, overseeing two wins and one draw in the Pinatar Cup in Spain She is taking over a country who are ranked sixth in the world but have experienced their own turmoil. During last summer’s Paris Olympics, in which Canada reached the quarter-finals, two members of the team’s coaching staff were sent home for flying a drone over a training session held by New Zealand, their opponents in a group game. Their head coach Bev Priestman, another Englishwoman, was given a year-long ban by world governing body Fifa and Canada - who had won Olympic gold at the delayed Tokyo 2020 Games - were docked six points. Priestman “did reach out and wish me luck” says Stoney, but they have had no other communication and the new Canada coach is keen to focus on the future, with the 2027 World Cup on the horizon. She met the majority of her players for the first time over the last two weeks as Canada competed in a four-team tournament, the Pinatar Cup, in Spain, which they won following a 7-0 thrashing of Chinese Taipei, a 2-0 win over Mexico and a 1-1 draw with China. “This team excites me,” she says. “I do think they’ve got so much potential. “What they were able to achieve last year in difficult circumstances shows what they’re capable of, but there’s so much more to come. ” Get the latest WSL news on our dedicated page "

I don’t think people understand when you take on a head coach role, and I understand people say you’re in a privileged position, but it’s the impact on your family it has. “I had young children that just didn’t understand what was going on [when she was sacked] - lots of tears, lots of heartache, that I felt like I’d contributed to that, which was difficult. “There were jobs open in the UK at the time when I didn’t have a job. There were some I would have been interested in, some I wouldn’t have been interested in, but as soon as I got involved in this process it became clear I was really interested in this [and] I was only committed to one thing. ” Casey Stoney took charge of Canada for the first time in February, overseeing two wins and one draw in the Pinatar Cup in Spain She is taking over a country who are ranked sixth in the world but have experienced their own turmoil. During last summer’s Paris Olympics, in which Canada reached the quarter-finals, two members of the team’s coaching staff were sent home for flying a drone over a training session held by New Zealand, their opponents in a group game. Their head coach Bev Priestman, another Englishwoman, was given a year-long ban by world governing body Fifa and Canada - who had won Olympic gold at the delayed Tokyo 2020 Games - were docked six points. Priestman “did reach out and wish me luck” says Stoney, but they have had no other communication and the new Canada coach is keen to focus on the future, with the 2027 World Cup on the horizon. She met the majority of her players for the first time over the last two weeks as Canada competed in a four-team tournament, the Pinatar Cup, in Spain, which they won following a 7-0 thrashing of Chinese Taipei, a 2-0 win over Mexico and a 1-1 draw with China. “This team excites me,” she says. “I do think they’ve got so much potential. “What they were able to achieve last year in difficult circumstances shows what they’re capable of, but there’s so much more to come. ” Get the latest WSL news on our dedicated page "

    "title": "Big News: I was effectively homeless after getting sacked - Stoney",
    "body": "2025/03/02 - Let’s dive into the details: I was effectively homeless after getting sacked - Stoney Casey Stoney was only meant to be returning to England temporarily last June for a funeral when she found herself stuck in the country, along with her family, unable to go back to their home in California. Upon landing on British soil, the former England captain was informed by her agent that she had been sacked as head coach of NWSL club San Diego Wave. “When I got fired, it terminated our visas with immediate effect whilst I was in the UK, pretty much rendering me and my partner homeless, with three children,” she tells BBC Sport. As she had been outside of the US when her sacking happened and her visa was dependent on her work, she had no way of returning without finding another sponsor. That led to a turbulent few months for the 42-year-old, who was left questioning whether she even wanted to keep working in football. Now the former Manchester United boss is taking on international management for the first time in her new role as Canada coach, and is finally back to doing what she loves - getting out on the training pitch and working with her players. Former England defender Casey Stoney (right) joined newly formed club San Diego Wave in June 2021 Stoney, who won 130 caps for England and captained Great Britain at the 2012 Olympics, had been in charge of San Diego Wave for nearly three years after resigning as Manchester United manager in 2021. The NWSL club were a new franchise when she became head coach and she led them to third place and then top spot during the first two seasons. They twice reached the semi-finals of the end-of-season play-offs, which crowns the league’s champions, but her third season had not continued on the same trajectory with just three wins after 14 games. She saw the job as a long-term project. She had experienced a painful spell apart from her partner, Megan, and three children - twins Teddy and Tilly and youngest child Willow - when she first moved to the US but they had eventually resolved their visa issues, enabling them to be reunited, and set up their family home in California. “It took 22 months to get them out there, we were 22 months apart, we weren’t even out there a year [together] and I lost my job,” she says. “If I’m honest, I didn’t think I deserved to lose my job either, so that made it even tougher, with the successes that we had, we just had a little dip. It wasn’t even anything major. “So to be treated in that way, after everything that had been done and sacrificed and everything that had been achieved, it was really, really hard to swallow on a personal level, but it was more what happened to my family. “I have three young children, they were nine and six at the time, they didn’t have a home. So that, for me, is inexcusable to do to a family. ” The day her children were supposed to be back at school in August in San Diego following their summer break came and went, so Stoney took on home-schooling herself. It was a period she describes as “one of the hardest times in my life”. She says: “It did make me question if I wanted to stay in the game because if the game chews you up and spits you out like that, after everything that we had sacrificed to be there, and after what I had achieved in a short space of time, and what we had achieved as a club, it did make me question the game. “I got offers quite quickly after the announcement and I said no to all of them, whether they were right or wrong, because I wanted to take time. I needed to make sure I sorted our lives out. “My priority was my family [and] how do we get back to San Diego. ” Casey Stoney, whose former clubs include Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea, walked out to a guard of honour with her three children before her final match as a player in February 2018 It took four months for the family to get new visas, based on Stoney’s consultancy work, enabling them to return to the US and “our lives”. They had relied on family in England to provide a roof over their heads in the interim. “[The children] missed two and a half months of education. They missed a lot of their life during that time. ” She also had a lot of time for self-reflection and took the opportunity to visit different clubs as she reassessed her priorities. “It just helped me get to a point where I was ready to get back in [to football] and I was very keen to get back in. At first I couldn’t have thought of anything less that I wanted to be involved in and it just took a bit of time to heal the wounds. ” The ex-England defender was spotted at her former club Arsenal, who were looking for a replacement for Jonas Eidevall while she was out of work, while other Women’s Super League clubs also had vacancies during that time. But then along came the Canada job. At first she was unsure whether she wanted to move into international football and leave behind what she “loves”, which is working with players day to day. Yet the initial conversations proved appealing and she found herself in a lengthy interview process lasting some three to four months. “I really liked that it was extensive,” she says. “It meant that their hiring process was thorough. I got to interview them as much as they interviewed me. ” That included speaking to the manager of the men’s team, former Leeds boss Jesse Marsch, who had already made the transition from club to the international game. And she was impressed â by the organisation’s leadership led by chief executive Kevin Blue, the culture of the team, and the talent of the players, plus Canada were happy for her to continue living in California if she took the role. “When I interviewed for this job, Kevin was very clear that I didn’t have to move,” she said. “That’s been really, really beneficial for us as a family.

    "title": "Update: A cash-filled briefcase, a missing shield and the beating of Australia",
    "body": "2025/02/27 - Experts revealed that Great Britain toured Australia in 1996 England v Australia: Women’s Test Venue: Allegiant Stadium, Las Vegas Date: Saturday, 1 March (02:00 GMT, Sunday, 2 March) Coverage: Live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app Lisa McIntosh is up-front with her thoughts on England’s women facing world champions Australia in Las Vegas. “Do you know? It makes me feel really proud,” says the former Great Britain captain. “But I’m not going to lie - I’m a bit envious. “I’d have loved to have just turned up with my kitbag and got on the plane and played in Vegas. But I’m made up for them. ” When England’s players step out at Allegiant Stadium in Vegas on Saturday night, McIntosh is part of the trailblazing group of women they can thank. Twenty-nine years ago, with minimal help, that group organised and self-funded a Great Britain tour to Australia - and beat the hosts. They remain the last British rugby league team to win an Ashes series. So they know what it takes to defeat the Jillaroos. “I think what England need to do is not fear them,” McIntosh says. “Australia are so good, that straight away people start to worry. “But you go out there and you be confident. If you match them player for player, there’s no reason why you can’t beat them. ” Back in 1996, Great Britain’s travelling party overcame the odds to defeat Australia. A series that was on a knife edge until its final seconds featured funding battles, scrambles for flights and accommodation, a tour manager carrying Â£29,000 in a briefcase, disappearing kit and emotional phone calls home. Then came the forging of lifelong friendships, belated Hall of Fame recognition - and a victory shield that vanished. But first came the fight just to get on to the pitch. Paula Clark was the team physio, Nikki Carter the tour manager, and Jackie Sheldon the assistant coach “It was basically about two weeks before we were due to go that we actually knew we were going,” says Jackie Sheldon, Great Britain’s assistant coach in 1996. Sheldon was secretary of the Women’s Amateur Rugby League Association (Warla), which then oversaw the British women’s game, when it received an invitation in 1995 to tour Australia. Accepting the offer was the easy part. Then came the trickier aspects. For a start, there wasn’t a Great Britain women’s team. So with Warla chair Anne Thompson, Sheldon set up a committee to hire a head coach, find players and form a backroom team. With no budget, everyone had to be persuaded to take on the roles unpaid. “These people who got involved were professional people,” Sheldon says. “And they were all giving their time for free. “I would go: ‘This is what I want, and I haven’t got any money. Will you come on board?’ And they’d say: ‘Yeah. ’ Because they believed in what we were trying to do. ” Ian Harris, a coach who worked in local authority sports development, took charge of the team, with Sheldon and Thompson as his assistants, and a squad of 26 was put together. Now they had to find Â£70,000 to pay for the tour. Sheldon, herself then a council sports development officer, got to work. “We were not funded by anywhere,” she says, “so I wrote a grant application to the Foundation for Sport and the Arts, and we got something like Â£34,000 from them. And each of the players were given a target of about Â£1,000 to raise. ” As the summer of 1996 approached, the plans were coming together. Then with just weeks to go, the team’s tour manager dropped out - and chaos loomed. Sheldon and Thompson knew Nikki Carter, a Hull Vixens player who had management experience from working at a care home. They asked if she would step in as tour manager. “I was asked: ‘Do you think you could help them out?’” Carter says. “I was like: ‘What do you mean?’ They said: ‘Go to Australia with them. ’ I was like: ‘Hmm, I’d love to. Best go and ask my boss, really. ’ “But it suddenly started to unravel. Lots of things that should have been organised 12 weeks out from going to Australia weren’t actually organised. ” The touring party had no flights, no accommodation, no kit. Sheldon says: “The previous manager, prior to Nikki, had been tasked with securing the flights, and he didn’t secure them and didn’t tell us, so it was only about three weeks beforehand that it all came out that we had no flights. “My manager allowed me time in work to phone all the airlines to try to get, I think, 32 flights at three weeks’ notice. ” As Sheldon sorted flights, Carter sourced kit, chased hotels and helped to complete the fundraising. “Most of the money was raised in the final eight weeks,” she says. They needed to set up a bank account quickly for the tour. And in 1996, that was a problem. “There was no bank account set up in Australia,” Carter says, “and it wasn’t like now, where you could ring the bank and say: ‘I’m going to put this money in there and I’m going to spend it from my bank account. ’ “One of the girls on the tour, who played for Wakefield, was a bank manager. And she said: ‘It’s not possible to set the bank account up. It took too long. ’ “So I ended up going to Australia with a briefcase with Â£29,000 in cash and travellers’ cheques, because there just was no other way. I carried that briefcase through the whole tour - everywhere I went, that went. ” The Great Britain party made it to Australia, but there were more obstacles. Arriving at Sydney Airport, they were hit with an immediate transport problem. Their coach was only big enough to fit either all the players, or all the kit - but not both. Carter, meanwhile, was organising team meals on the fly. “I think there was a lot of bartering,” captain McIntosh says, “trying to get good deals, where we’d get breakfast and tea included. ” The team faced seven matches in 19 days: a Sydney Select side were thumped 86-0, before an Australian Capital Territory side were defeated 36-0 in Canberra, where the first Test against Australia was also held. Great Britain lost that match 16-14, to a late penalty - amid controversy. “We got a penalty in the last few minutes,” McIntosh says. “Karen Burrows converted it, but the officials disallowed it - they said it didn’t go over. ” Next was a trip north to Brisbane, with the team booked in for an exhausting 12-hour, 700-mile-plus coach journey. Tour manager Carter intervened. “We’d gone on the coach from Sydney to Canberra, but we needed to fly to Brisbane,” Carter says. “So we went to the airport and I said: ‘Would you be able to get us 32 flight tickets from Canberra to Brisbane tomorrow?’ And the guy at the desk looked at me a bit strange. He tapped away and he said: ‘Oh, yeah, yeah, we could do that. ’ Then I had to negotiate on all the luggage. “And then I said to him: ‘OK. How would I pay: Cash or travellers’ cheques?’ And this guy’s face was a picture. So I paid for 32 flights with some travellers’ cheques. ” In Brisbane, the Great Britain and Australia players stayed in the same accommodation. “They were like student dorms,” McIntosh says. Here, there was another challenge for the tourists - keeping track of their kit. “We were given each two shirts, so at the end of the tour, we had one to swap and one to keep so we could frame,” McIntosh says. “But the kit was laundered and a couple of shirts from our bag went missing, including my spare number 13 shirt. “We never found out what happened to it, but we had our suspicions. ” Britain beat a Queensland XIII 22-8 to warm up for the second Test against Australia, and they won that key match 18-12 to level the series. Now it was back to Sydney for the decider. But for some members of the squad with young children, being far away from home was proving tough. “I rang home at certain times of the day because I knew the kids wouldn’t be there,” Carter says. “My eldest daughter was six when I went. If I rang home, she would be crying down the phone, saying: ‘I’m missing you, Mummy. ’ And it would then take days to recover from that phone call. “There was that pang of guilt because I’m out here and I’m having a great time. At the same time, I’ve left my children at home - and as a mother, is that the right thing? “It was hard and anybody in that position who says it wasn’t, I think will be telling you porky pies. ” Great Britain’s team of 1996 are the only northern hemisphere women’s side to have beaten Australia in a three-Test series After a 30-0 victory over a Presidents XIII in Sydney, Great Britain faced the deciding Test against Australia. It was a nail-biter. The tourists built up a healthy lead, with McIntosh running half the length of the pitch for a fine individual try - but had to withstand a battering as Australia fought back. As the clock ticked down, Britain held a slender 20-18 lead. “We were defending on our line for our lives for the last 10 minutes,” McIntosh says. “It just never seemed to end. ” The captain has little memory of watching those closing minutes, having been concussed in a clattering tackle. “When the final whistle went,” McIntosh says, “I said to Paula Clark, the team physio: Have we won? “We didn’t realise how significant it would be in time - winning the Ashes in Australia. It was just like: ‘We beat the Aussies on their own turf and it was great. ’” Lisa McIntosh and vice-captain Brenda Dobek would be later inducted into the Rugby League Hall of Fame The Britain squad returned to a quiet reception at Heathrow. “We came through the airport and it was like tumbleweed,” McIntosh says. But off the back of the series win, Sheldon convinced Sport England to fund a national women’s rugby league development manager and was asked to take on the role. She would also be England’s head coach through a 1998 tour to New Zealand, the World Cups of 2000 and 2003 and, in between, a return tour to Australia in 2002. “The development dropped off after 2003, when I left,” Sheldon says. “GB was not a priority for the RFL at the time. It was re-established in 2007 when they started getting Sport England funding for it, but neither England nor GB have beaten Australia since 2002. “You can see the difference in terms of what Australia started to do after that period. “It’s physicality, building the team, intensity of competition, and development of the women’s game, so you’ve got breadth and depth of players coming through. It’s an infrastructure you need, and you can see it in Australia. ” Belatedly, Great Britain’s 1996 team have been recognised. Former referee Julia Lee, who officiated during the tour, began driving the Women in Rugby League project, a celebration of the sport’s female pioneers. In 2022, McIntosh joined team-mates Brenda Dobek and Sally Milburn as they became the first women inducted into the Rugby League Hall of Fame. Last October, Jane Banks and Michelle Land followed, while the 1996 side became the first team to be inducted. “I think it’s sad that it took so long, but I think it’s fantastic that we’re in a different place now,” Carter says. October’s ceremony in Wigan brought virtually the entire squad back together. “There was a camaraderie that was built in ‘96,” Carter says. “We all met up for the Hall of Fame inauguration, and it was like we’d never been away from each other. ” Great Britain’s players made long-lasting friendships with the Australians too - which finally reunited McIntosh with one of her shirts. “I never found the shirt that was taken during the tour, but I did get back the one that I swapped,” McIntosh says. “Their captain, who I swapped my shirt with, returned it to me. ” But there’s one major memento from 1996 that no-one can find. Great Britain’s team, mostly in Australia shirts, show off the shield that later went missing Britain’s players, wearing the Australia shirts they had just swapped, posed for a team picture after winning the series. In that special moment, they showed off their prize - a large shield. Three years ago, before an exhibition to celebrate their achievements, an appeal was put out to locate the shield. It hasn’t turned up. “We thought we’d brought it back, and that it was at the RFL,” McIntosh says. “But it’s not. ” The mystery remains unresolved. “Lisa always said she reckoned I had it in my attic,” Sheldon says. “I’ve got just about everything else in my attic but not that shield. ” If anyone does have it, they’re sitting on a piece of history. “It’s in somebody’s attic, because I can’t see where else it would have gone,” Carter says. “So maybe everyone needs to look in their attic!” "

It was just like: ‘We beat the Aussies on their own turf and it was great. ’” Lisa McIntosh and vice-captain Brenda Dobek would be later inducted into the Rugby League Hall of Fame The Britain squad returned to a quiet reception at Heathrow. “We came through the airport and it was like tumbleweed,” McIntosh says. But off the back of the series win, Sheldon convinced Sport England to fund a national women’s rugby league development manager and was asked to take on the role. She would also be England’s head coach through a 1998 tour to New Zealand, the World Cups of 2000 and 2003 and, in between, a return tour to Australia in 2002. “The development dropped off after 2003, when I left,” Sheldon says. “GB was not a priority for the RFL at the time. It was re-established in 2007 when they started getting Sport England funding for it, but neither England nor GB have beaten Australia since 2002. “You can see the difference in terms of what Australia started to do after that period. “It’s physicality, building the team, intensity of competition, and development of the women’s game, so you’ve got breadth and depth of players coming through. It’s an infrastructure you need, and you can see it in Australia. ” Belatedly, Great Britain’s 1996 team have been recognised. Former referee Julia Lee, who officiated during the tour, began driving the Women in Rugby League project, a celebration of the sport’s female pioneers. In 2022, McIntosh joined team-mates Brenda Dobek and Sally Milburn as they became the first women inducted into the Rugby League Hall of Fame. Last October, Jane Banks and Michelle Land followed, while the 1996 side became the first team to be inducted. “I think it’s sad that it took so long, but I think it’s fantastic that we’re in a different place now,” Carter says. October’s ceremony in Wigan brought virtually the entire squad back together. “There was a camaraderie that was built in ‘96,” Carter says. “We all met up for the Hall of Fame inauguration, and it was like we’d never been away from each other. ” Great Britain’s players made long-lasting friendships with the Australians too - which finally reunited McIntosh with one of her shirts. “I never found the shirt that was taken during the tour, but I did get back the one that I swapped,” McIntosh says. “Their captain, who I swapped my shirt with, returned it to me. ” But there’s one major memento from 1996 that no-one can find. Great Britain’s team, mostly in Australia shirts, show off the shield that later went missing Britain’s players, wearing the Australia shirts they had just swapped, posed for a team picture after winning the series. In that special moment, they showed off their prize - a large shield. Three years ago, before an exhibition to celebrate their achievements, an appeal was put out to locate the shield. It hasn’t turned up. “We thought we’d brought it back, and that it was at the RFL,” McIntosh says. “But it’s not. ” The mystery remains unresolved. “Lisa always said she reckoned I had it in my attic,” Sheldon says. “I’ve got just about everything else in my attic but not that shield. ” If anyone does have it, they’re sitting on a piece of history. “It’s in somebody’s attic, because I can’t see where else it would have gone,” Carter says. “So maybe everyone needs to look in their attic!” "

    "title": "Breaking: A cash-filled briefcase, a missing shield and the beating of Australia",
    "body": "2025/02/27 - Here’s what you need to know: Great Britain toured Australia in 1996 England v Australia: Women’s Test Venue: Allegiant Stadium, Las Vegas Date: Saturday, 1 March (02:00 GMT, Sunday, 2 March) Coverage: Live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app Lisa McIntosh is up-front with her thoughts on England’s women facing world champions Australia in Las Vegas. “Do you know? It makes me feel really proud,” says the former Great Britain captain. “But I’m not going to lie - I’m a bit envious. “I’d have loved to have just turned up with my kitbag and got on the plane and played in Vegas. But I’m made up for them. ” When England’s players step out at Allegiant Stadium in Vegas on Saturday night, McIntosh is part of the trailblazing group of women they can thank. Twenty-nine years ago, with minimal help, that group organised and self-funded a Great Britain tour to Australia - and beat the hosts. They remain the last British rugby league team to win an Ashes series. So they know what it takes to defeat the Jillaroos. “I think what England need to do is not fear them,” McIntosh says. “Australia are so good, that straight away people start to worry. “But you go out there and you be confident. If you match them player for player, there’s no reason why you can’t beat them. ” Back in 1996, Great Britain’s travelling party overcame the odds to defeat Australia. A series that was on a knife edge until its final seconds featured funding battles, scrambles for flights and accommodation, a tour manager carrying Â£29,000 in a briefcase, disappearing kit and emotional phone calls home. Then came the forging of lifelong friendships, belated Hall of Fame recognition - and a victory shield that vanished. But first came the fight just to get on to the pitch. Paula Clark was the team physio, Nikki Carter the tour manager, and Jackie Sheldon the assistant coach “It was basically about two weeks before we were due to go that we actually knew we were going,” says Jackie Sheldon, Great Britain’s assistant coach in 1996. Sheldon was secretary of the Women’s Amateur Rugby League Association (Warla), which then oversaw the British women’s game, when it received an invitation in 1995 to tour Australia. Accepting the offer was the easy part. Then came the trickier aspects. For a start, there wasn’t a Great Britain women’s team. So with Warla chair Anne Thompson, Sheldon set up a committee to hire a head coach, find players and form a backroom team. With no budget, everyone had to be persuaded to take on the roles unpaid. “These people who got involved were professional people,” Sheldon says. “And they were all giving their time for free. “I would go: ‘This is what I want, and I haven’t got any money. Will you come on board?’ And they’d say: ‘Yeah. ’ Because they believed in what we were trying to do. ” Ian Harris, a coach who worked in local authority sports development, took charge of the team, with Sheldon and Thompson as his assistants, and a squad of 26 was put together. Now they had to find Â£70,000 to pay for the tour. Sheldon, herself then a council sports development officer, got to work. “We were not funded by anywhere,” she says, “so I wrote a grant application to the Foundation for Sport and the Arts, and we got something like Â£34,000 from them. And each of the players were given a target of about Â£1,000 to raise. ” As the summer of 1996 approached, the plans were coming together. Then with just weeks to go, the team’s tour manager dropped out - and chaos loomed. Sheldon and Thompson knew Nikki Carter, a Hull Vixens player who had management experience from working at a care home. They asked if she would step in as tour manager. “I was asked: ‘Do you think you could help them out?’” Carter says. “I was like: ‘What do you mean?’ They said: ‘Go to Australia with them. ’ I was like: ‘Hmm, I’d love to. Best go and ask my boss, really. ’ “But it suddenly started to unravel. Lots of things that should have been organised 12 weeks out from going to Australia weren’t actually organised. ” The touring party had no flights, no accommodation, no kit. Sheldon says: “The previous manager, prior to Nikki, had been tasked with securing the flights, and he didn’t secure them and didn’t tell us, so it was only about three weeks beforehand that it all came out that we had no flights. “My manager allowed me time in work to phone all the airlines to try to get, I think, 32 flights at three weeks’ notice. ” As Sheldon sorted flights, Carter sourced kit, chased hotels and helped to complete the fundraising. “Most of the money was raised in the final eight weeks,” she says. They needed to set up a bank account quickly for the tour. And in 1996, that was a problem. “There was no bank account set up in Australia,” Carter says, “and it wasn’t like now, where you could ring the bank and say: ‘I’m going to put this money in there and I’m going to spend it from my bank account. ’ “One of the girls on the tour, who played for Wakefield, was a bank manager. And she said: ‘It’s not possible to set the bank account up. It took too long. ’ “So I ended up going to Australia with a briefcase with Â£29,000 in cash and travellers’ cheques, because there just was no other way. I carried that briefcase through the whole tour - everywhere I went, that went. ” The Great Britain party made it to Australia, but there were more obstacles. Arriving at Sydney Airport, they were hit with an immediate transport problem. Their coach was only big enough to fit either all the players, or all the kit - but not both. Carter, meanwhile, was organising team meals on the fly. “I think there was a lot of bartering,” captain McIntosh says, “trying to get good deals, where we’d get breakfast and tea included. ” The team faced seven matches in 19 days: a Sydney Select side were thumped 86-0, before an Australian Capital Territory side were defeated 36-0 in Canberra, where the first Test against Australia was also held. Great Britain lost that match 16-14, to a late penalty - amid controversy. “We got a penalty in the last few minutes,” McIntosh says. “Karen Burrows converted it, but the officials disallowed it - they said it didn’t go over. ” Next was a trip north to Brisbane, with the team booked in for an exhausting 12-hour, 700-mile-plus coach journey. Tour manager Carter intervened. “We’d gone on the coach from Sydney to Canberra, but we needed to fly to Brisbane,” Carter says. “So we went to the airport and I said: ‘Would you be able to get us 32 flight tickets from Canberra to Brisbane tomorrow?’ And the guy at the desk looked at me a bit strange. He tapped away and he said: ‘Oh, yeah, yeah, we could do that. ’ Then I had to negotiate on all the luggage. “And then I said to him: ‘OK. How would I pay: Cash or travellers’ cheques?’ And this guy’s face was a picture. So I paid for 32 flights with some travellers’ cheques. ” In Brisbane, the Great Britain and Australia players stayed in the same accommodation. “They were like student dorms,” McIntosh says. Here, there was another challenge for the tourists - keeping track of their kit. “We were given each two shirts, so at the end of the tour, we had one to swap and one to keep so we could frame,” McIntosh says. “But the kit was laundered and a couple of shirts from our bag went missing, including my spare number 13 shirt. “We never found out what happened to it, but we had our suspicions. ” Britain beat a Queensland XIII 22-8 to warm up for the second Test against Australia, and they won that key match 18-12 to level the series. Now it was back to Sydney for the decider. But for some members of the squad with young children, being far away from home was proving tough. “I rang home at certain times of the day because I knew the kids wouldn’t be there,” Carter says. “My eldest daughter was six when I went. If I rang home, she would be crying down the phone, saying: ‘I’m missing you, Mummy. ’ And it would then take days to recover from that phone call. “There was that pang of guilt because I’m out here and I’m having a great time. At the same time, I’ve left my children at home - and as a mother, is that the right thing? “It was hard and anybody in that position who says it wasn’t, I think will be telling you porky pies. ” Great Britain’s team of 1996 are the only northern hemisphere women’s side to have beaten Australia in a three-Test series After a 30-0 victory over a Presidents XIII in Sydney, Great Britain faced the deciding Test against Australia. It was a nail-biter. The tourists built up a healthy lead, with McIntosh running half the length of the pitch for a fine individual try - but had to withstand a battering as Australia fought back. As the clock ticked down, Britain held a slender 20-18 lead. “We were defending on our line for our lives for the last 10 minutes,” McIntosh says. “It just never seemed to end. ” The captain has little memory of watching those closing minutes, having been concussed in a clattering tackle. “When the final whistle went,” McIntosh says, “I said to Paula Clark, the team physio: Have we won? “We didn’t realise how significant it would be in time - winning the Ashes in Australia. It was just like: ‘We beat the Aussies on their own turf and it was great. ’” Lisa McIntosh and vice-captain Brenda Dobek would be later inducted into the Rugby League Hall of Fame The Britain squad returned to a quiet reception at Heathrow. “We came through the airport and it was like tumbleweed,” McIntosh says.

It was re-established in 2007 when they started getting Sport England funding for it, but neither England nor GB have beaten Australia since 2002. “You can see the difference in terms of what Australia started to do after that period. “It’s physicality, building the team, intensity of competition, and development of the women’s game, so you’ve got breadth and depth of players coming through.

    "title": "Update: Michelle Mone-linked PPE firm evidence to be heard in private",
    "body": "2025/02/26 - Let’s dive into the details: The chair of the Covid inquiry has ruled that evidence related to PPE Medpro, the firm linked to Baroness Michelle Mone and her husband Doug Barrowman, will be heard in a closed, private session next month. On 3 March, the inquiry will begin four weeks of hearings into decisions to buy Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during the pandemic. Baroness Hallett said she was imposing the restriction as she was satisfied there was a risk of prejudice to criminal proceedings if “sensitive evidence” was heard in public. Victims’ groups and media outlets, including the BBC, had argued the dangers were overstated, given the early stage of the police investigation and the material already in the public domain. The National Crime Agency (NCA) opened an investigation into PPE Medpro in May 2021 into suspected criminal offences committed in the procurement of PPE. The company was awarded government contracts worth more than £200m after Baroness Mone recommended the firm to ministers during the Covid pandemic. Baroness Mone, 52, and Mr Barrowman, 59, have denied wrongdoing. In June 2024, the NCA said an unnamed 46-year-old man from Barnet, north London, had been arrested as part of its investigation. To date, no criminal charges have been brought and the Crown Prosecution Service has not been formally instructed by the NCA. On 9 December 2024, the Covid inquiry said it had received an application from the NCA for a restriction order, claiming there was a risk of harm to its investigation if sensitive evidence about PPE Medpro was heard in public. The NCA originally wanted to prevent the inquiry hearing any evidence about the company, saying “other contracts could be selected”. It then asked for 26 witness statements written by its staff to be withheld, and an order to be made preventing certain questions about the firm to be asked in the inquiry room in a public session. It argued those restrictions should include the identity of any person under investigation; evidence relating to the opinion of any government official concerning PPE Medpro’s contracts; and evidence about payments to the company and who ultimately benefited. In its submission, it said there was a “realistic possibility that criminal charges against one or more individuals will flow from the investigation”. The Department of Health later asked for the terms of any restriction order to be widened to include any “financial material and correspondence” relating to the purchase of PPE from the company, although that request has been rejected by the inquiry. In her final ruling, Baroness Hallett said it was both “necessary and proportionate” for the Covid inquiry to examine contracts between the government and PPE Medpro. But she did accept there was a risk of damage to any future criminal proceedings if she allowed all the evidence to be heard in public. As a result, any sensitive evidence about the company will be heard in a private, closed hearing, expected to be held in late March. She said the NCA’s original application, which also sought to have members of the press and other organisations excluded from those closed sessions, went “further than necessary” and was “too wide an approach”. Representatives of five media organisations will be invited to attend but will not be able to report on the proceedings until the conclusion of any criminal case, including possible appeals. Baroness Hallett said that decision was in line with previous public inquiries, including the investigation into the Novichok poisoning in Salisbury. A spokesman for the NCA said its investigation into PPE Medpro “remains a priority”. “In such cases it can take considerable time to ensure that a thorough, independent and objective investigation is conducted,” he added.

    "title": "Update: First place in British Isles set to approve right to die",
    "body": "2025/02/25 - It has been recently reported that A law to give terminally ill adults on the Isle of Man the right to end their own lives is entering its final stages, making it potentially the first jurisdiction in the British Isles to legalise assisted dying. Anyone over the age of 18 and with a prognosis of 12 months or fewer to live would be eligible, under the legislation being debated in the Manx parliament. The bill will not be passed yet, since the Isle of Man’s lower house has rejected an amendment that would have meant people would only need residency on the island for one year to take advantage of the legislation. The House of Keys continued to insist on five-year residency and have sent the legislation back to the upper house. The move comes as MPs in Westminster are scrutinising a bill that would legalise assisted dying in England and Wales. A separate bill is under discussion in Scotland. People on the Isle of Man eligible to request assisted dying would have to: The measures have been a matter of strong debate in Tynwald, the island’s parliament. It is likely the bill will receive Royal Assent and become law, with the scheme possibly up and running by 2027. Jersey - a self-governing territory like the Isle of Man which can make its own laws - is also moving ahead with legislation to establish an assisted dying service. Former GP Dr Alex Allinson introduced the private members bill to Tynwald and has been pivotal in ushering it through the legislative process. He hopes this will be the last time it will need to be debated by the directly elected chamber. “The passage of this bill has been a long and careful process starting in 2022 and has been properly consulted on, scrutinised and put through a full parliamentary process,” Dr Allinson says. “It lays the basis for further work to implement a service on the Island for those facing a terminal illness who would like more autonomy and dignity at the time of their death. ” Among the key clauses in the most recent version of the bill are measures on age and length of prognosis. The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, introduced by backbench Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, is currently being scrutinised by MPs in Westminster. If passed it would become law in England and Wales. It has some similarities to the Isle of Man legislation - people must be terminally ill, over 18 and registered with a GP. Both bills spell out the need for patients to have the mental capacity to make the choice and be deemed to have expressed a clear, settled and informed wish, free from coercion or pressure. The Isle of Man bill says people would be expected to have fewer than 12 months to live, but the Leadbeater bill has adopted a more conservative six months. The Manx suggestion of needing five years of residency on the island to be eligible is to try to stop people going there to take advantage of the scheme, as people do by travelling to Switzerland’s Dignitas clinic. On the Isle of Man, two independent doctors will need to agree the request for assisted dying, but Leadbeater has recently suggested that cases in England and Wales could be approved by a panel of experts rather than a single judge, as was originally proposed. That change has proved controversial, but is one of about 300 amendments being considered by a cross-party committee of MPs. Meanwhile, the legislation being proposed in Jersey has very similar restrictions to the Westminster plans. However, it has a proposal that would extend the right to die for terminally ill adults with six months or fewer left to live to 12 months for people with neurodegenerative conditions As with the Westminster legislation, the Isle of Man has experienced some passionate campaigning both for and against the proposed new law. A third of doctors who responded to an Isle of Man Medical Society survey in 2023 said they would consider leaving if the legislation was introduced. Some doctors fear the legislation will be a “slippery slope” that will see the scope of the laws extended. Isle of Man GP Dr Martin Rankin is a member of the Medical Society and is worried about the dangers of coercion, where vulnerable people are pressured to end their lives early. “The safeguards that are in place on this one, I’m not going to know if somebody has been coerced by a relative into ending their life sooner than they wish. “So I really won’t be getting involved in it. ” However, there have been some passionate campaigners who have spent years fighting for this legislation. Millie Blenkinsop-French lost her son James to neck cancer, aged only 52. It was a very difficult, painful death that cemented her belief in assisted dying for the terminally ill. “Nobody in their right mind would be against assisted dying if they had to sit, like I did, and watch my son die. “I wish with all my heart and soul that assisted dying had been in then, I really do, because he would have opted for it. He wasn’t a stupid boy, he was a very intelligent young man. “And it’ll give an awful lot of people the chance that James didn’t have, give an awful lot of people the chance to say, you know, ‘enough is enough, let me pass over’. ” The Isle of Man legislation now looks set to become law, but as politicians in Jersey, Westminster and Holyrood also consider their own proposals, the wider debate about assisted dying is far from over.

However, it has a proposal that would extend the right to die for terminally ill adults with six months or fewer left to live to 12 months for people with neurodegenerative conditions As with the Westminster legislation, the Isle of Man has experienced some passionate campaigning both for and against the proposed new law. A third of doctors who responded to an Isle of Man Medical Society survey in 2023 said they would consider leaving if the legislation was introduced.

    "title": "Breaking: First place in British Isles set to approve right to die",
    "body": "2025/02/25 - According to new developments, A law to give terminally ill adults on the Isle of Man the right to end their own lives is entering its final stages, making it potentially the first jurisdiction in the British Isles to legalise assisted dying. Anyone over the age of 18 and with a prognosis of 12 months or fewer to live would be eligible, under the legislation being debated in the Manx parliament. The bill will not be passed yet, since the Isle of Man’s lower house has rejected an amendment that would have meant people would only need residency on the island for one year to take advantage of the legislation. The House of Keys continued to insist on five-year residency and have sent the legislation back to the upper house. The move comes as MPs in Westminster are scrutinising a bill that would legalise assisted dying in England and Wales. A separate bill is under discussion in Scotland. People on the Isle of Man eligible to request assisted dying would have to: The measures have been a matter of strong debate in Tynwald, the island’s parliament. It is likely the bill will receive Royal Assent and become law, with the scheme possibly up and running by 2027. Jersey - a self-governing territory like the Isle of Man which can make its own laws - is also moving ahead with legislation to establish an assisted dying service. Former GP Dr Alex Allinson introduced the private members bill to Tynwald and has been pivotal in ushering it through the legislative process. He hopes this will be the last time it will need to be debated by the directly elected chamber. “The passage of this bill has been a long and careful process starting in 2022 and has been properly consulted on, scrutinised and put through a full parliamentary process,” Dr Allinson says. “It lays the basis for further work to implement a service on the Island for those facing a terminal illness who would like more autonomy and dignity at the time of their death. ” Among the key clauses in the most recent version of the bill are measures on age and length of prognosis. The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, introduced by backbench Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, is currently being scrutinised by MPs in Westminster. If passed it would become law in England and Wales. It has some similarities to the Isle of Man legislation - people must be terminally ill, over 18 and registered with a GP. Both bills spell out the need for patients to have the mental capacity to make the choice and be deemed to have expressed a clear, settled and informed wish, free from coercion or pressure. The Isle of Man bill says people would be expected to have fewer than 12 months to live, but the Leadbeater bill has adopted a more conservative six months. The Manx suggestion of needing five years of residency on the island to be eligible is to try to stop people going there to take advantage of the scheme, as people do by travelling to Switzerland’s Dignitas clinic. On the Isle of Man, two independent doctors will need to agree the request for assisted dying, but Leadbeater has recently suggested that cases in England and Wales could be approved by a panel of experts rather than a single judge, as was originally proposed. That change has proved controversial, but is one of about 300 amendments being considered by a cross-party committee of MPs.

    "title": "Update: Generation K - The disturbing rise of ketamine abuse among young people",
    "body": "2025/02/25 - Here’s what you need to know: Listen to Jane read this article At the urology department of Burnley General Hospital, 26-year-old Ryan (not his real name) is having a drug solution inserted through a catheter - part of his treatment for a condition known as ketamine bladder. This procedure will not completely reverse the damage inflicted by Ryan’s previous addiction to the Class B drug, but it will help him manage the symptoms. Ketamine, a powerful horse tranquiliser and anaesthetic, is a licensed drug and can be prescribed medically. However, when misused, it can cause serious and sometimes permanent damage to the bladder. The hospital is watching Ryan for signs of kidney failure, too. He worries about finding a girlfriend and having children. But he is stoical when he talks about passing blood and having to urinate numerous times a day. “You could not be a ketamine addict for 30 years, 20 years,” he says. “You’d die. ” He is under the care of consultant urologist Haytham Elsakka, who says he has witnessed a rise in young patients whose bladders have been damaged by ketamine use. “Some of them are in their 30s, but most of them are 16 to 24,” says Dr Elsakka. Around half of young patients end up needing surgery, he adds. Other risks from recreational use include liver failure, damage to the urethra, incontinence and impotence. “We have seen young people under the age of 25 who’ve completely lost control of their bladders, who have had to have surgery, including bladder removal,” says Abigail Wilson, lead clinical pharmacist for national drug and alcohol charity WithYou. In and around the town of Burnley, Ryan is far from alone. Lancashire County Council says it is helping a growing number of families affected by ketamine addiction in the Burnley area. According to WithYou, which runs a ketamine support service for young people aged 11 to 24, the number seeking help across Lancashire increased from 32 in 2018-19 to 123 by the end of 2024. And the area is not unusual. In England, the number of under-18s entering drug treatment who describe ketamine as one of their problem substances rose from 335 to 917 between 2020-21 and 2023-24, according to the National Drug Treatment Monitoring System. An anonymised 2023 survey of more than 13,000 secondary schoolchildren from 185 schools across England reported 11% of 15-year-olds had been offered ketamine at some point. The same study, conducted for NHS England, suggested the use of ketamine among schoolchildren had more than doubled in the last decade from 0. 4% in 2013 to 0. 9% in 2023. The drug came into the spotlight following the death of Friends actor Matthew Perry aged 54, after which a coroner found ketamine had been the primary cause. Doctors and experts subsequently described how the market for the drug in the US has exploded as it has grown in popularity among Hollywood celebrities. And thousands of miles away, among ordinary young people in UK towns, ketamine – also known as special K, vitamin K, or kit kat - has also become fashionable. Although highly dangerous, it is often seen as a sociable way to get high, with users buying it in powder form and snorting it. Now, just 11 years after ketamine was reclassified from Class C to Class B, the UK government is seeking expert advice on whether to make ketamine a Class A drug. This would mean anyone supplying it could be handed a life sentence. But some experts are sceptical this would make much of a difference. While ketamine use appears to be on the rise among the young, there is a sharp divide in opinion around what can be done to halt that. One Saturday afternoon in September 2023, the hottest day of the year, a 16-year-old called Preston McNally took ketamine with three friends in Burnley. High on the drug, he fell into the Leeds and Liverpool canal that flows through the town. Preston’s friends had also taken the drug and did not call for help straight away, an inquest was later told. The coroner said Preston drowned due to ketamine intoxication. The inquest also heard that he had told his sister he was trying to quit just before he died. Those on the front line are well aware of the scale of the problem. “The amount of mums that have said to me, ‘It’s everywhere’,” says Fr Alex Frost from St Matthews Church in the town. He runs a support group for parents of ketamine users. “It’s in the schools, it’s in the parks. ” Across Lancashire, recorded offences for possession and supply of ketamine rose by nearly 70% from 54 in 2023 to 91 in 2024. “What we have seen, probably within the last 12 months, is the upturn in the use, particularly around children,” says Insp Matt Plummer of Lancashire Police. “Sometimes the parents have no idea. ” Once ketamine was known as a party drug, associated with the club scene. But there’s evidence to suggest that has changed. In a 2024 report into drug trends in Greater Manchester, school-aged children recounted how they used it with friends to “chill” in the local parks or at home. Those who go on to use it away from social settings are often doing so “to self-medicate unmet mental health support needs such as anxiety and trauma”, says the author of the report, Robert Ralphs, a professor of criminology and social policy at Manchester Metropolitan University. One mother, who we are calling Claire, told the BBC she was oblivious to the fact that her 14-year-old daughter Lexi (not her real name) was addicted to ketamine until the teenager ended up in hospital with severe stomach cramps. Lexi, who lives on a neat, well-cared-for street in Burnley, loved sport and dancing. But after she started secondary school, she says, a friend introduced her to ketamine. “I knew it was illegal… and it was a horse tranquiliser,” says Lexi. “That’s all I knew. I didn’t really want to do it, but I just thought, well, everybody else is doing it and I didn’t really want to be the odd one out. ” One reason that so many young people are gravitating towards ketamine is they can buy it for pocket-money prices, according to Lexi. “It were easy to get – like, really easy,” she says. In Burnley, friends will chip in for the £15 to £30 it costs for a gram and share it. To feed her habit, Lexi would ask her mum for a couple of pounds for the bus or some make-up - or sometimes she would steal a £10 note. If Lexi had been coming home drunk or smelling of weed, her mother Claire would have twigged. Claire says: “I was absolutely gobsmacked, just distraught, really, thinking: how did I not know?” What makes ketamine especially dangerous is that lots of people, particularly young people, wrongly see it as a lower-risk drug, says Mrs Wilson of the WithYou charity. At lower doses, she says, it has a similar effect to alcohol. “The effects can wear off from about 40 minutes to just over an hour after taking it,” she adds. “If you want to keep those effects, then repeat dosing is required to continue them. ” And this means users’ habits can escalate rapidly, according to Aaron (not his real name), who lives in a small town outside Burnley and took his first snort of ketamine when he was just 16. “Your tolerance goes up extremely quickly and within the first month you’re doing stupid amounts,” he says. Soon he was spending £200 month on the drug. Higher doses can lead to a state known as a K-hole, “which is where you become completely detached from reality and also paralysed”, says Mrs Wilson. Then there is the psychological impact. The WithYou charity is helping Lexi recover from dependence on the drug, but also trauma and self-harm. Once, when she was high, she was the victim of a sexual assault. When kids are on ketamine, they are extremely vulnerable. Some of the families of ketamine addicts the BBC has spoken to want the drug reclassified as Class A. But this would also mean children caught in possession of ketamine could face up to seven years in jail rather than five. Putting ketamine in the same bracket as heroin and cocaine “may increase the stigma and make young people less likely to discuss their use and seek help”, warns Prof Ralphs. The government is currently seeking expert advice from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) on whether the drug should be reclassified. “Ketamine is an extremely dangerous substance and the recent rise in its use is deeply concerning,” says Dame Diana Johnson, the policing minister. “It is vital we are responding to all the latest evidence and advice to ensure people’s safety and we will carefully consider the ACMD’s recommendations before making any decision. ” Families in the Burnley area say the authorities also need to do more to help those suffering as a result of what Fr Frost calls an “epidemic” of ketamine use. In response, Lancashire County Council says it is “dedicated to supporting children and young people affected by ketamine use in our community” and that it “will continue to work tirelessly to address the challenges posed by ketamine use and to provide the necessary support to those in need”. There is scepticism from those on the frontline that increased enforcement will solve the issue. “It’s not a case that we can just arrest our way out of the ketamine issue,” says Insp Plummer. “You could arrest 10, 15 people a day for the possession of ketamine if you found them, but it’s not going to change the cycle, particularly with kids. ” He adds that generally children caught with ketamine are given informal words of advice and referred for support, not charged. And some experts query how effective reclassification would be.  These include Prof Ralphs, who observes that the 2014 shift from Class C to Class B has not prevented the recent rise in usage among young people. He also suggests that would have no impact on people’s decisions to supply it either, as most ketamine dealers already supply Class A substances as well. He adds that reclassification “will not deter young people from using it if their underlying mental health and wellbeing needs continue to be unmet”. In the meantime, no one yet knows what the long-term effects will be for children who start taking ketamine at 12, 13 or 14. Community leaders and the families the BBC spoke to say they cannot wait for change, and that urgent action is needed now to try to prevent more young people suffering. Lexi says she is trying to move forward with her life. Since the doctors at the hospital told Lexi where her life could be heading, she has not used ketamine. Getting the drug out of her head is still not easy. She insists she will never take another dose of ketamine. But, she says, “the urge is always there for me to do it again”.

Now, just 11 years after ketamine was reclassified from Class C to Class B, the UK government is seeking expert advice on whether to make ketamine a Class A drug. This would mean anyone supplying it could be handed a life sentence. But some experts are sceptical this would make much of a difference. While ketamine use appears to be on the rise among the young, there is a sharp divide in opinion around what can be done to halt that. One Saturday afternoon in September 2023, the hottest day of the year, a 16-year-old called Preston McNally took ketamine with three friends in Burnley. High on the drug, he fell into the Leeds and Liverpool canal that flows through the town. Preston’s friends had also taken the drug and did not call for help straight away, an inquest was later told. The coroner said Preston drowned due to ketamine intoxication. The inquest also heard that he had told his sister he was trying to quit just before he died. Those on the front line are well aware of the scale of the problem. “The amount of mums that have said to me, ‘It’s everywhere’,” says Fr Alex Frost from St Matthews Church in the town. He runs a support group for parents of ketamine users. “It’s in the schools, it’s in the parks. ” Across Lancashire, recorded offences for possession and supply of ketamine rose by nearly 70% from 54 in 2023 to 91 in 2024. “What we have seen, probably within the last 12 months, is the upturn in the use, particularly around children,” says Insp Matt Plummer of Lancashire Police. “Sometimes the parents have no idea. ” Once ketamine was known as a party drug, associated with the club scene. But there’s evidence to suggest that has changed. In a 2024 report into drug trends in Greater Manchester, school-aged children recounted how they used it with friends to “chill” in the local parks or at home. Those who go on to use it away from social settings are often doing so “to self-medicate unmet mental health support needs such as anxiety and trauma”, says the author of the report, Robert Ralphs, a professor of criminology and social policy at Manchester Metropolitan University. One mother, who we are calling Claire, told the BBC she was oblivious to the fact that her 14-year-old daughter Lexi (not her real name) was addicted to ketamine until the teenager ended up in hospital with severe stomach cramps. Lexi, who lives on a neat, well-cared-for street in Burnley, loved sport and dancing. But after she started secondary school, she says, a friend introduced her to ketamine. “I knew it was illegal… and it was a horse tranquiliser,” says Lexi. “That’s all I knew. I didn’t really want to do it, but I just thought, well, everybody else is doing it and I didn’t really want to be the odd one out. ” One reason that so many young people are gravitating towards ketamine is they can buy it for pocket-money prices, according to Lexi. “It were easy to get – like, really easy,” she says. In Burnley, friends will chip in for the £15 to £30 it costs for a gram and share it. To feed her habit, Lexi would ask her mum for a couple of pounds for the bus or some make-up - or sometimes she would steal a £10 note. If Lexi had been coming home drunk or smelling of weed, her mother Claire would have twigged. Claire says: “I was absolutely gobsmacked, just distraught, really, thinking: how did I not know?” What makes ketamine especially dangerous is that lots of people, particularly young people, wrongly see it as a lower-risk drug, says Mrs Wilson of the WithYou charity. At lower doses, she says, it has a similar effect to alcohol. “The effects can wear off from about 40 minutes to just over an hour after taking it,” she adds. “If you want to keep those effects, then repeat dosing is required to continue them. ” And this means users’ habits can escalate rapidly, according to Aaron (not his real name), who lives in a small town outside Burnley and took his first snort of ketamine when he was just 16. “Your tolerance goes up extremely quickly and within the first month you’re doing stupid amounts,” he says. Soon he was spending £200 month on the drug. Higher doses can lead to a state known as a K-hole, “which is where you become completely detached from reality and also paralysed”, says Mrs Wilson. Then there is the psychological impact. The WithYou charity is helping Lexi recover from dependence on the drug, but also trauma and self-harm. Once, when she was high, she was the victim of a sexual assault. When kids are on ketamine, they are extremely vulnerable. Some of the families of ketamine addicts the BBC has spoken to want the drug reclassified as Class A. But this would also mean children caught in possession of ketamine could face up to seven years in jail rather than five. Putting ketamine in the same bracket as heroin and cocaine “may increase the stigma and make young people less likely to discuss their use and seek help”, warns Prof Ralphs. The government is currently seeking expert advice from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) on whether the drug should be reclassified. “Ketamine is an extremely dangerous substance and the recent rise in its use is deeply concerning,” says Dame Diana Johnson, the policing minister. “It is vital we are responding to all the latest evidence and advice to ensure people’s safety and we will carefully consider the ACMD’s recommendations before making any decision. ” Families in the Burnley area say the authorities also need to do more to help those suffering as a result of what Fr Frost calls an “epidemic” of ketamine use. In response, Lancashire County Council says it is “dedicated to supporting children and young people affected by ketamine use in our community” and that it “will continue to work tirelessly to address the challenges posed by ketamine use and to provide the necessary support to those in need”. There is scepticism from those on the frontline that increased enforcement will solve the issue. “It’s not a case that we can just arrest our way out of the ketamine issue,” says Insp Plummer. “You could arrest 10, 15 people a day for the possession of ketamine if you found them, but it’s not going to change the cycle, particularly with kids. ” He adds that generally children caught with ketamine are given informal words of advice and referred for support, not charged. And some experts query how effective reclassification would be.  These include Prof Ralphs, who observes that the 2014 shift from Class C to Class B has not prevented the recent rise in usage among young people. He also suggests that would have no impact on people’s decisions to supply it either, as most ketamine dealers already supply Class A substances as well. He adds that reclassification “will not deter young people from using it if their underlying mental health and wellbeing needs continue to be unmet”. In the meantime, no one yet knows what the long-term effects will be for children who start taking ketamine at 12, 13 or 14. Community leaders and the families the BBC spoke to say they cannot wait for change, and that urgent action is needed now to try to prevent more young people suffering. Lexi says she is trying to move forward with her life. Since the doctors at the hospital told Lexi where her life could be heading, she has not used ketamine. Getting the drug out of her head is still not easy. She insists she will never take another dose of ketamine. But, she says, “the urge is always there for me to do it again”.

    "title": "Big News: Generation K - The disturbing rise of ketamine abuse among young people",
    "body": "2025/02/25 - Experts revealed that Listen to Jane read this article At the urology department of Burnley General Hospital, 26-year-old Ryan (not his real name) is having a drug solution inserted through a catheter - part of his treatment for a condition known as ketamine bladder. This procedure will not completely reverse the damage inflicted by Ryan’s previous addiction to the Class B drug, but it will help him manage the symptoms. Ketamine, a powerful horse tranquiliser and anaesthetic, is a licensed drug and can be prescribed medically. However, when misused, it can cause serious and sometimes permanent damage to the bladder. The hospital is watching Ryan for signs of kidney failure, too. He worries about finding a girlfriend and having children. But he is stoical when he talks about passing blood and having to urinate numerous times a day. “You could not be a ketamine addict for 30 years, 20 years,” he says. “You’d die. ” He is under the care of consultant urologist Haytham Elsakka, who says he has witnessed a rise in young patients whose bladders have been damaged by ketamine use. “Some of them are in their 30s, but most of them are 16 to 24,” says Dr Elsakka. Around half of young patients end up needing surgery, he adds. Other risks from recreational use include liver failure, damage to the urethra, incontinence and impotence. “We have seen young people under the age of 25 who’ve completely lost control of their bladders, who have had to have surgery, including bladder removal,” says Abigail Wilson, lead clinical pharmacist for national drug and alcohol charity WithYou. In and around the town of Burnley, Ryan is far from alone. Lancashire County Council says it is helping a growing number of families affected by ketamine addiction in the Burnley area. According to WithYou, which runs a ketamine support service for young people aged 11 to 24, the number seeking help across Lancashire increased from 32 in 2018-19 to 123 by the end of 2024. And the area is not unusual. In England, the number of under-18s entering drug treatment who describe ketamine as one of their problem substances rose from 335 to 917 between 2020-21 and 2023-24, according to the National Drug Treatment Monitoring System. An anonymised 2023 survey of more than 13,000 secondary schoolchildren from 185 schools across England reported 11% of 15-year-olds had been offered ketamine at some point. The same study, conducted for NHS England, suggested the use of ketamine among schoolchildren had more than doubled in the last decade from 0. 4% in 2013 to 0. 9% in 2023. The drug came into the spotlight following the death of Friends actor Matthew Perry aged 54, after which a coroner found ketamine had been the primary cause. Doctors and experts subsequently described how the market for the drug in the US has exploded as it has grown in popularity among Hollywood celebrities. And thousands of miles away, among ordinary young people in UK towns, ketamine – also known as special K, vitamin K, or kit kat - has also become fashionable. Although highly dangerous, it is often seen as a sociable way to get high, with users buying it in powder form and snorting it.

    "body": "2025/02/19 - It has been recently reported that A free-to-use sauna in Kent has become a “real community hub” due to its accessibility, its manager has said. In 2014, the company People Care. Planet Care - formerly known as Haeckels - launched a fundraising campaign to build a community sauna in the Cliftonville area of Margate. More than £30,000 was raised to help build the sauna in the style of a 19th Century bathing machine, which since 2020 has been set up permanently at Walpole Bay. Manager Tyler Halliday says that taking away the “payment barrier” makes the space accessible for everyone and instils a sense of ownership. “People feel like it belongs to them, and they want to look after it,” he said. “All the public here absolutely adore it, and they look after it. I think that’s part of why people love it so much. ” Carolina Soto Pik, who has been a user for five years and a volunteer for two, describes the sauna as “my therapy”. She said: “Everybody here is in a really good mood; if you have problems you leave them outside; inside it’s just a zen space. ” Mr Halliday said the sauna was the only free facility of its kind in the UK. When built, it was intended as a “hark back to the history of bathing machines in Margate”, which were used frequently in the town during Victorian times. “The design was completely custom. You’ll never find something else that looks quite like it,” he added. Follow BBC Kent on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

    "title": "Update: 'I signed Barcelona deal - then had a stroke at 24'",
    "body": "2025/02/19 - Experts revealed that ‘I signed Barcelona deal - then had a stroke at 24’ As England and Barcelona goalkeeper Ellie Roebuck sips her flat white in the Spanish sunshine outside her favourite coffee shop, she looks like a player who has the world at her feet. But this is a very different picture from 12 months ago. Last February she was told that, at the age of 24, she had suffered a stroke and was left fearing she would never play football again. “I’m lucky because I should have lost my vision,” she tells BBC Sport. “I should have lost my peripheral vision for sure. The majority of people that suffer a stroke [like mine] do that. So, I probably should have been blind, which is quite a miracle that that didn’t happen. ” Roebuck was part of the Lionesses squad that won the Euros in 2022 and reached the World Cup final in the summer of 2023. But the former Manchester City keeper could never have predicted that six months after that match in Sydney, her world would be turned upside down. This is Roebuck’s story - one of sport’s remarkable comebacks. This video can not be played I could have lost my vision - Roebuck on stroke After returning from World Cup duty in Australia, Roebuck’s season did not go to plan at Manchester City â a club she had been at since the age of 15, making her debut as a teenager in 2016. The Sheffield-born keeper found herself frozen out of the first team and did not make an appearance in the first half of the season, but she was also struggling off the pitch. It was around Christmas 2023 when Roebuck first started to feel like something was “not quite right”, although she could not work out what it was. She felt nauseous, dizzy, fatigued, a bit off balance and her eyesight started to be affected with black dots impairing her vision. A ball had hit the back of her head in training, nothing unusual for a goalkeeper, so her symptoms were put down to that. She was treated for concussion at her club but as January progressed Roebuck was certain it had to be something else. “I knew it wasn’t concussion,” she said. “I’ve had concussion. I just knew something wasn’t right. I said ‘for my peace of mind I need a head scan, something is not right and I know it’. ” When she got the call from the club doctor a couple of days after the scan asking her to come in immediately, she knew it was not going to be good news. “It filled me with panic, but I never had in my mind that it was a stroke. “He sat me down and was like, ‘you’ve had an infarct in your left occipital lobe’. I asked ‘what’s that in English?’ And then he said it was a type of stroke. ” A stroke happens when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off. That can lead to paralysis and in some cases, death. The occipital lobe is the visual processing area of the brain and a stroke in this area can cause an array of visual impairments. Roebuck adds: “My first question was ‘am I going to play football again?’” Ellie Roebuck earned her last England call-up in October 2023 At the time no-one could give her an answer, and the timing could not have been worse as the diagnosis came just two weeks after she had formalised her exit from Manchester City by signing a pre-contract with European champions Barcelona, before a move in the summer. But she quickly realised her worries went beyond football as she was sent straight from her appointment to accident and emergency for treatment. “I was sat in A&amp;E with all the people on a Thursday night that’d been out drinking. They’d come in with their cuts and bruises and I was just sat there [thinking] ‘what is happening?’ And then I got taken to the stroke ward which was something that I’d never really want to remember. “You’re in there with people that I thought were ‘normal people’ to have strokes - older people. It was just a crazy experience. ” Because tests showed her stroke appeared to have happened three to four weeks earlier, there was little the hospital could do and she was sent home that night. “The nurses said you can’t carry shopping for six weeks. You can’t do any exercise. I thought, ‘I’m a professional footballer, I can’t do that’. ” Roebuck was not allowed to train for 12 weeks and was left to pick up the pieces, trying to figure out what had caused the stroke and constantly fearing it would happen again. “I wouldn’t walk my dog for like six weeks. I wouldn’t leave the house. I was scared to do anything on my own. And that was never me, I was always super independent. My mum and dad were doing shifts of living with me in my one-bedroom flat in Manchester. ” She underwent numerous tests in order to find out the cause of what had happened and eventually a tiny hole in her heart was discovered. “[It] sounds crazy, but I was grateful that I had a hole in my heart because I’d found my reason and I knew that it could be closed and I could move on. I was almost excited that I was going in for heart surgery. ” In surgery the hole was identified however a membrane had formed and doctors believed it had closed up by itself which left Roebuck frustrated again as it meant she would never fully understand what caused her stroke. “You’ve almost got to think you’ve been given a second chance, but I’m also so angry that it happened, because I think ‘why?’” With a dream move to European heavyweights Barcelona on the line, Roebuck initially kept the news of her condition from her City team-mates. She admits it was a lonely time, but she found support from two sportsmen who had been through similar experiences. One was NFL Superbowl winner Tedy Bruschi, who had two strokes during his career. The other was former Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech, who suffered a serious head injury during a game in 2006. “I had a call with him for about two hours and it was amazing. Although it wasn’t directly the same, it was someone I could relate to going through a similar thing. “He touched on things that nobody else got. No matter how many times I tried to express myself, I couldn’t. Nobody could relate to what I was going through. “He is now a good friend of mine. He came to watch me train the other day in Barcelona. So, there are positives to come out of it - the new relationships I’ve formed. ” Ellie Roebuck played alongside the likes of Jill Scott, Keira Walsh, Steph Houghton and Izzy Christiansen early in her Manchester City career Roebuck did not play for Manchester City again after her stroke but she was able to complete her dream move to Barcelona in the summer. Yet she says the way her final season was handled at a club where she made more than 100 appearances left her confidence “diminished”. “I just felt like maybe my relationship with the manager [Gareth Taylor] got fractured. “I don’t know whether that was me, maybe not hearing the clear communication or the fact that there just wasn’t clear communication. “I got my head down and I just tried to work every day, but I think it was a badly managed situation. I’ve always been professional. I just felt like the respect wasn’t reciprocated in that same sense. ” Roebuck says that while she was “devastated” to leave City, it made joining Barcelona, who have won three of the last four Champions League titles, a very easy decision. However, she admits that her first training session with the club after six months out was a lot more difficult than she anticipated. “After coming back from having a brain injury and then saying you’ve got to dive at someone’s feet, it’s not the prettiest. But I had to get through it. “Barcelona showed trust in me and for me, that was more important than anybody saying you can have a starting role. It’s the fact they showed confidence in me, and they wanted me here and they want to improve me. “The girls are amazing. The top three Ballon d’Or nominees are all in this changing room and it was a shock how nice everybody is, it’s crazy to me. I’ve never been a part of a team other than the England team that’s like this. “So, for me it’s a perfect fit and I enjoy going in every day. ” Now 25, Roebuck made her Barca debut in December in a 4-1 win over Real Betis, 303 days after her diagnosis and more than 18 months since her last appearance. “Everyone expected me to be nervous, but I felt fine the moment I stepped out there. That’s the kind of the mantra I’m going for, every time I get that opportunity, I just want to enjoy it. ” Ellie Roebuck is competing with Spain goalkeeper Cata Coll for the number one jersey at Barcelona Roebuck says that while she thinks about the stroke every day and still battles symptoms like fatigue, she is very much focused on the future. And that also now includes her coffee bean roasting company. “I feel like I value life a lot more. I was stuck in a real cycle of thinking football was everything. “And I think for that period of time where I didn’t know if I could be a footballer, it made me realise, you have to find something else. And that was hard because my whole personality was Ellie the footballer. “I didn’t know if I was going play again so it was just a great way to channel my energy and have that focus to distract myself. It’s a perfect way to start and eventually hopefully one day the aim is to have a coffee shop. “The biggest struggle is becoming a normal human again but luckily I’ve nearly been able to do that. ” Roebuck, who has 11 England caps, says representing the Lionesses has always been the “highest privilege” in her career but that her comeback may have come too late for a recall in time for this summer’s Euros. “It’s difficult because that’s something that’s not in my hands as such. Nothing is given. I know that’s not an easy journey. And I know that I need to be playing consistently week in, week out, but for me it’s more than that, it’s a journey that I’m on. “Now I’m prioritising the things that are most important, and that’s being the best goalkeeper I can possibly be. ” "

    "body": "2025/02/19 - Experts revealed that ‘I signed Barcelona deal - then had a stroke at 24’ As England and Barcelona goalkeeper Ellie Roebuck sips her flat white in the Spanish sunshine outside her favourite coffee shop, she looks like a player who has the world at her feet. But this is a very different picture from 12 months ago. Last February she was told that, at the age of 24, she had suffered a stroke and was left fearing she would never play football again. “I’m lucky because I should have lost my vision,” she tells BBC Sport. “I should have lost my peripheral vision for sure. The majority of people that suffer a stroke [like mine] do that. So, I probably should have been blind, which is quite a miracle that that didn’t happen. ” Roebuck was part of the Lionesses squad that won the Euros in 2022 and reached the World Cup final in the summer of 2023. But the former Manchester City keeper could never have predicted that six months after that match in Sydney, her world would be turned upside down. This is Roebuck’s story - one of sport’s remarkable comebacks. This video can not be played I could have lost my vision - Roebuck on stroke After returning from World Cup duty in Australia, Roebuck’s season did not go to plan at Manchester City â a club she had been at since the age of 15, making her debut as a teenager in 2016. The Sheffield-born keeper found herself frozen out of the first team and did not make an appearance in the first half of the season, but she was also struggling off the pitch. It was around Christmas 2023 when Roebuck first started to feel like something was “not quite right”, although she could not work out what it was. She felt nauseous, dizzy, fatigued, a bit off balance and her eyesight started to be affected with black dots impairing her vision. A ball had hit the back of her head in training, nothing unusual for a goalkeeper, so her symptoms were put down to that. She was treated for concussion at her club but as January progressed Roebuck was certain it had to be something else. “I knew it wasn’t concussion,” she said. “I’ve had concussion. I just knew something wasn’t right. I said ‘for my peace of mind I need a head scan, something is not right and I know it’. ” When she got the call from the club doctor a couple of days after the scan asking her to come in immediately, she knew it was not going to be good news. “It filled me with panic, but I never had in my mind that it was a stroke. “He sat me down and was like, ‘you’ve had an infarct in your left occipital lobe’. I asked ‘what’s that in English?’ And then he said it was a type of stroke. ” A stroke happens when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off. That can lead to paralysis and in some cases, death. The occipital lobe is the visual processing area of the brain and a stroke in this area can cause an array of visual impairments. Roebuck adds: “My first question was ‘am I going to play football again?’” Ellie Roebuck earned her last England call-up in October 2023 At the time no-one could give her an answer, and the timing could not have been worse as the diagnosis came just two weeks after she had formalised her exit from Manchester City by signing a pre-contract with European champions Barcelona, before a move in the summer. But she quickly realised her worries went beyond football as she was sent straight from her appointment to accident and emergency for treatment. “I was sat in A&amp;E with all the people on a Thursday night that’d been out drinking. They’d come in with their cuts and bruises and I was just sat there [thinking] ‘what is happening?’ And then I got taken to the stroke ward which was something that I’d never really want to remember. “You’re in there with people that I thought were ‘normal people’ to have strokes - older people. It was just a crazy experience. ” Because tests showed her stroke appeared to have happened three to four weeks earlier, there was little the hospital could do and she was sent home that night. “The nurses said you can’t carry shopping for six weeks. You can’t do any exercise. I thought, ‘I’m a professional footballer, I can’t do that’. ” Roebuck was not allowed to train for 12 weeks and was left to pick up the pieces, trying to figure out what had caused the stroke and constantly fearing it would happen again. “I wouldn’t walk my dog for like six weeks. I wouldn’t leave the house. I was scared to do anything on my own. And that was never me, I was always super independent. My mum and dad were doing shifts of living with me in my one-bedroom flat in Manchester. ” She underwent numerous tests in order to find out the cause of what had happened and eventually a tiny hole in her heart was discovered. “[It] sounds crazy, but I was grateful that I had a hole in my heart because I’d found my reason and I knew that it could be closed and I could move on. I was almost excited that I was going in for heart surgery. ” In surgery the hole was identified however a membrane had formed and doctors believed it had closed up by itself which left Roebuck frustrated again as it meant she would never fully understand what caused her stroke. “You’ve almost got to think you’ve been given a second chance, but I’m also so angry that it happened, because I think ‘why?’” With a dream move to European heavyweights Barcelona on the line, Roebuck initially kept the news of her condition from her City team-mates. She admits it was a lonely time, but she found support from two sportsmen who had been through similar experiences. One was NFL Superbowl winner Tedy Bruschi, who had two strokes during his career. The other was former Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech, who suffered a serious head injury during a game in 2006. “I had a call with him for about two hours and it was amazing. Although it wasn’t directly the same, it was someone I could relate to going through a similar thing. “He touched on things that nobody else got. No matter how many times I tried to express myself, I couldn’t. Nobody could relate to what I was going through. “He is now a good friend of mine. He came to watch me train the other day in Barcelona. So, there are positives to come out of it - the new relationships I’ve formed. ” Ellie Roebuck played alongside the likes of Jill Scott, Keira Walsh, Steph Houghton and Izzy Christiansen early in her Manchester City career Roebuck did not play for Manchester City again after her stroke but she was able to complete her dream move to Barcelona in the summer. Yet she says the way her final season was handled at a club where she made more than 100 appearances left her confidence “diminished”. “I just felt like maybe my relationship with the manager [Gareth Taylor] got fractured. “I don’t know whether that was me, maybe not hearing the clear communication or the fact that there just wasn’t clear communication. “I got my head down and I just tried to work every day, but I think it was a badly managed situation. I’ve always been professional. I just felt like the respect wasn’t reciprocated in that same sense. ” Roebuck says that while she was “devastated” to leave City, it made joining Barcelona, who have won three of the last four Champions League titles, a very easy decision. However, she admits that her first training session with the club after six months out was a lot more difficult than she anticipated. “After coming back from having a brain injury and then saying you’ve got to dive at someone’s feet, it’s not the prettiest. But I had to get through it. “Barcelona showed trust in me and for me, that was more important than anybody saying you can have a starting role. It’s the fact they showed confidence in me, and they wanted me here and they want to improve me. “The girls are amazing. The top three Ballon d’Or nominees are all in this changing room and it was a shock how nice everybody is, it’s crazy to me. I’ve never been a part of a team other than the England team that’s like this. “So, for me it’s a perfect fit and I enjoy going in every day. ” Now 25, Roebuck made her Barca debut in December in a 4-1 win over Real Betis, 303 days after her diagnosis and more than 18 months since her last appearance. “Everyone expected me to be nervous, but I felt fine the moment I stepped out there. That’s the kind of the mantra I’m going for, every time I get that opportunity, I just want to enjoy it. ” Ellie Roebuck is competing with Spain goalkeeper Cata Coll for the number one jersey at Barcelona Roebuck says that while she thinks about the stroke every day and still battles symptoms like fatigue, she is very much focused on the future. And that also now includes her coffee bean roasting company. “I feel like I value life a lot more. I was stuck in a real cycle of thinking football was everything. “And I think for that period of time where I didn’t know if I could be a footballer, it made me realise, you have to find something else. And that was hard because my whole personality was Ellie the footballer. “I didn’t know if I was going play again so it was just a great way to channel my energy and have that focus to distract myself. It’s a perfect way to start and eventually hopefully one day the aim is to have a coffee shop. “The biggest struggle is becoming a normal human again but luckily I’ve nearly been able to do that. ” Roebuck, who has 11 England caps, says representing the Lionesses has always been the “highest privilege” in her career but that her comeback may have come too late for a recall in time for this summer’s Euros. “It’s difficult because that’s something that’s not in my hands as such. Nothing is given. I know that’s not an easy journey. And I know that I need to be playing consistently week in, week out, but for me it’s more than that, it’s a journey that I’m on. “Now I’m prioritising the things that are most important, and that’s being the best goalkeeper I can possibly be. ” "

    "title": "Update: How does Daniel Levy run Tottenham - and would he ever leave?",
    "body": "2025/02/14 - Let’s dive into the details: How does Daniel Levy run Tottenham - and would he ever leave? A popular chant among match-going Tottenham fans at the moment is: “I don’t care about Levy, he doesn’t care about me, all I care about is Kulusevski. ” Prominent banners at the home defeat by Leicester last month read: “Our game is about glory, Levy’s game is about greed” and “24 years, 16 managers, 1 trophy - time for change”. A crisis of about 30 separate injuries and poor form has left manager Ange Postecoglou exposed, irritable, and under pressure, with his side 14th in the Premier League and out of both domestic cups. The debate about who or what is to blame for Spurs’ struggles is going round in circles. Alongside Manchester United’s failings and Manchester City’s decline, it has been one of the narratives of this season. Fan anger has again been aimed at chairman Daniel Levy - vocalised in persistent ‘Levy out’ calls from supporters both home and away. Club sources told BBC Sport the protests are “hurting” Levy, who attends almost every game and sits stoically through the criticism. Tottenham were one of the busiest clubs in the January transfer window, but that has not satisfied some fans who criticise a recruitment policy mainly focused on under-21 players with potential resale value, and who regularly accuse Levy of acting too slowly in the market and putting profits above success on the pitch. A ‘sit-down’ protest - led by a smaller supporter group called Change for Tottenham (CFT) - is planned against Levy before Sunday’s Premier League match against Manchester United. Last week, the main fan group - the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters’ Trust (THST) - released five core principles they want to hold Levy to account on. Among those principles were demands to “commit to winning” with investment; “attract and retain talent” with competitive wages; “develop elite youth talent”; “lead with integrity” to be “financially sustainable” while “keeping tickets affordable”; and engage with fans. BBC Sport has spoken to several people on and off the record to try to understand the fuller picture of Levy’s Tottenham regime. Some of the key points made were: Levy will step aside when he feels it is right for Spurs and “every option is open” for different future ownership structures He is “hurt” by protests, “hurt” by results, and has opted to sit through the ‘Levy out’ chants rather than hide away An acceptance Spurs have not always spent well in the transfer market but belief that recent managers, including Postecoglou, have been backed financially Club leadership feel they have come closer to winning more than just the 2008 League Cup in the Enic/Levy era having reached 15 semi-finals and six finals Sources who have worked with Levy say he does not communicate well enough and suggest the executive team are too similar, hence occasional “own goals” on policies. A banner asking for change was displayed at full-time after Tottenham lost at home to Leicester in January Football finance expert Kieran Maguire says any discussion of Levy’s tenure must be framed by Tottenham becoming the “most profitable club in Premier League history” because of the money their new stadium generates, a historically lower wage structure and a “degree of caution” on transfer spending. He describes Spurs as a “superb cash-making machine” who have “outperformed any other club in England”. Maguire outlined: His figures show that from 2001 to 2023, Tottenham made Â£171m profit. Burnley were second on Â£159m, with Arsenal third on Â£105m In the past decade, Spurs have the sixth-highest total wage bill in the Premier League (Â£1. 6bn vs Man City’s Â£2. 9bn as the highest); the sixth-highest transfer spend (Â£1. 3bn vs Chelsea’s Â£2. 8bn as the most); with the fifth-highest net spend over a similar period Tottenham fans pay among the highest season ticket prices and matchday prices in the top flight Levy has the highest chief executive pay of Premier League clubs that declare such data. In 2023, the most recent figures available, Spurs’ highest-paid director - unnamed but assumed to be Levy - earned Â£6. 6m. Daniel Levy has been Tottenham’s chairman since 2001 Club insiders describe Levy, 63, as “shy, quiet and hard-working” - and a man who loves the club and is affected by fan criticism. Multiple sources who know him have expressed respect for Tottenham’s progress under his leadership. One source with knowledge of the inner workings of the club, who wished to remain anonymous, said Levy can be “very ruthless” but “genuinely wants the best for Spurs”. They claimed some of the “own goals” - such as using the government furlough scheme during Covid in 2020 and more recently phasing out senior concession tickets - are partly because Levy does not “surround himself with the best people”. They described the executive leadership and club board, which includes operations and finance director Matthew Collecott and executive director Donna-Maria Cullen, as “people too similar to him” who will “sit with their heads in their phones”, rather than “people who make up for [Levy’s] weaknesses”. The source said Levy does not successfully deliver his messages about caring for the club because he is not a strong public speaker and chooses to avoid it, adding: “One interview or being visible once a year is not a lot. ” While Tottenham’s football structure has changed frequently, including technical directors, managing directors and heads of football operations, sources say the club rigidly sticks to “Levy’s philosophy and recruitment policy - to buy young players with promise who can add value”. Another source who has worked with Levy in the Spurs hierarchy, also speaking anonymously, backed his passion for the club and said the idea the chairman does not care because he rarely shows emotion is “nonsense”. They added that Levy is unrelenting - working “crazy” hours which can be tough and tiring for colleagues - and always wants more, something which can grate with people who do not like that style of leadership. From the archive: Inside Levy’s 20 years at Tottenham (2021) Postecoglou unsure on future - but why do many Spurs fans blame Levy? Is Postecoglou’s style causing Tottenham’s injury crisis? Sources at the club believe Levy will step aside when he feels it is right for Tottenham. They say he would not be motivated by vanity to stay on if there was an outright takeover - and the club remains open to investment with all future ownership structures on the table. While Levy may be the focal point of protests, it was stressed that he is a minority shareholder of the club through his own family trust - and Enic, itself mostly owned by the Lewis family trust, remains the majority owner. That means any change or purchase would need approval from the Lewis family, and there are other minority shareholders with a say. During the current protests, the THST has expressed frustration but has not called for Levy to leave, unlike CFT, which is a smaller splinter group looking to apply pressure in internal fan politics and towards the club. Other sources agreed the only realistic way in which Levy would leave Spurs would be on his own terms. He is the Premier League’s highest-paid chief executive - earning an estimated Â£50m-plus over his 25 years in charge. This week a Guardian article reported potential interest in Tottenham from an unnamed Qatari consortium, although sources with knowledge of Spurs’ ownership situation played it down. In 2023, when Paris St-Germain’s owners Qatari Sports Investment (QSI) were exploring the possibility of a minority stake in an English club, Tottenham were one of the teams linked. Levy maintains a close relationship with PSG and QSI chairman Nasser Al-Khelaifi. One source added that Levy - a renowned negotiator famously described by Sir Alex Ferguson as “more painful [to deal with] than a hip replacement” - will demand a high price for Spurs given their elite facilities, brand, London premium and the revenue the club now generates. Various reports in recent years have valued Tottenham at between Â£3. 5bn and Â£4bn. Chelsea were bought in a deal worth up to Â£4. 25bn from Roman Abramovich in 2022 by a consortium led by American investor Todd Boehly and private equity firm Clearlake Capital. The purchase price was Â£2. 5bn with a commitment to spending Â£1. 75bn over the next 10 years. Meanwhile, Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s Ineos bought a 25% stake in Manchester United for Â£1. 03bn in December 2023 in a process which included a rival bid from Qatar’s Sheikh Jassim, reported to be nearer to Â£5bn for 100% of the club. Despite those huge sums, both clubs - unlike Tottenham - need major investment in their stadiums to unlock bigger commercial earning potential. According to the first source, the period when Tottenham were building their new Â£1. 2bn stadium, between 2017 and 2019, meant Levy was “all-consumed” and the board “left everyone to do their jobs”. Spurs secured Champions League football under Mauricio Pochettino for four successive seasons to 2018-19 - and were beaten in the 2019 final by Liverpool. That source suggested Levy’s approach - namely “open to conversations but set in his ways” - has meant a lot of people with off-field expertise have left Spurs over the years for more influential jobs. Paul Barber was an executive director between 2005-2010 and is now Brighton chief executive; Michael Edwards was Spurs’ chief analyst from 2009-2011 before leaving for Liverpool; FA technical director John McDermott was Tottenham’s head of academy and player development until 2020; while EFL chief executive Trevor Birch was - very briefly - Tottenham’s director of football operations, from September 2020 to January 2021. It could be argued that many of these highly-rated executives enjoyed good careers at Tottenham before simply moving on - but the source claims they “left the building far too easily”. Another source to have worked closely with Levy at Spurs, again speaking anonymously, pointed out he has delivered “a core infrastructure that is probably the best in the world” and suggested that would give the club “an incredible foundation for future success - probably after Daniel’s time”. They said it had taken Arsenal 10 to 15 years to get back to competing for titles and regularly qualifying for Champions League football after they rebuilt their infrastructure, with Levy having inherited a dilapidated stadium, old training ground and ageing squad. However, the source suggested Levy has not yet got the “formula right” by employing the right head coach with the right players at the same time. One criticism some fans have consistently aimed at Levy and Tottenham’s executive board is a lack of understanding of what it takes to succeed on the pitch. Levy, Collecott and Cullen have worked together for a quarter of a century - one source described them as “the Holy Trinity to an extent” - with the chairman known to be “loyal to people loyal to him”. They are supported at the top level by director of football administration and governance Rebecca Caplehorn and non-executive director Jonathan Turner. The source said that in their experience at Tottenham there was no block on outside or different views, but it can be hard for newcomers especially those without an affinity to Spurs. They added that Levy, Collecott, 56, and Cullen, 61 are “probably an unbreakable group” given their longevity and close relationships, but did stress they will not be at Tottenham forever. It was suggested to BBC Sport that personal factors such as age and the trio’s own health or the health of relatives could lead them to “re-evaluate”. Sources inside the club accepted the various backgrounds of people on Tottenham’s board mean they know more about business than football, but pointed out that another six-person board - which includes chief football officer Scott Munn and technical director Johan Lange - sits underneath to advise on all football decisions. They will have a major say on any managerial appointments, while transfers are led by Lange and only finalised by Levy - with Munn running the rest of the football operation. Tottenham insiders accept they have not always spent well, and have made transfer mistakes in the past, but believe they have backed recent managers - including Postecoglou - and are happy with deals such as those for Dominic Solanke, Archie Gray and Lucas Bergvall. It is also felt that raising profits to record levels is the only way Tottenham can compete with teams like Man City and Newcastle and their ownership models. Spurs sources feel they have been close to winning more trophies than just one trophy in the Enic/Levy era - having reached 15 semi-finals and six finals - and the five other clubs in the ‘traditional top six’ are either richer or bigger. “We don’t make any apologies that we are trying to increase our revenue base to invest more in our teams if that means raising money through concerts to invest in the teams then I don’t apologise at all,” Levy said at September’s fan forum. “We announced with our last results that we believe this club needs a bigger capital base because we’ve got a lot of exciting projects on the horizon and we want to make further investment in the teams. Some form of minority investment is what we’re looking for. ” In a further defence of Levy, one source pointed to fan discontent at Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke in 2019 and 2021, as well as Manchester United’s 12 months of troubles under new co-owner Ratcliffe. They believe a “vocal minority” of fans simply want success now, but should be careful what they wish for with calls for change. They added: “Spurs haven’t got the formula on the pitch just yet but it will come. ” Latest Tottenham news, analysis and fan views Get Tottenham news sent straight to your phone "

    "title": "Breaking: How does Daniel Levy run Tottenham - and would he ever leave?",
    "body": "2025/02/14 - According to new developments, How does Daniel Levy run Tottenham - and would he ever leave? A popular chant among match-going Tottenham fans at the moment is: “I don’t care about Levy, he doesn’t care about me, all I care about is Kulusevski. ” Prominent banners at the home defeat by Leicester last month read: “Our game is about glory, Levy’s game is about greed” and “24 years, 16 managers, 1 trophy - time for change”. A crisis of about 30 separate injuries and poor form has left manager Ange Postecoglou exposed, irritable, and under pressure, with his side 14th in the Premier League and out of both domestic cups. The debate about who or what is to blame for Spurs’ struggles is going round in circles. Alongside Manchester United’s failings and Manchester City’s decline, it has been one of the narratives of this season. Fan anger has again been aimed at chairman Daniel Levy - vocalised in persistent ‘Levy out’ calls from supporters both home and away. Club sources told BBC Sport the protests are “hurting” Levy, who attends almost every game and sits stoically through the criticism. Tottenham were one of the busiest clubs in the January transfer window, but that has not satisfied some fans who criticise a recruitment policy mainly focused on under-21 players with potential resale value, and who regularly accuse Levy of acting too slowly in the market and putting profits above success on the pitch. A ‘sit-down’ protest - led by a smaller supporter group called Change for Tottenham (CFT) - is planned against Levy before Sunday’s Premier League match against Manchester United. Last week, the main fan group - the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters’ Trust (THST) - released five core principles they want to hold Levy to account on. Among those principles were demands to “commit to winning” with investment; “attract and retain talent” with competitive wages; “develop elite youth talent”; “lead with integrity” to be “financially sustainable” while “keeping tickets affordable”; and engage with fans. BBC Sport has spoken to several people on and off the record to try to understand the fuller picture of Levy’s Tottenham regime. Some of the key points made were: Levy will step aside when he feels it is right for Spurs and “every option is open” for different future ownership structures He is “hurt” by protests, “hurt” by results, and has opted to sit through the ‘Levy out’ chants rather than hide away An acceptance Spurs have not always spent well in the transfer market but belief that recent managers, including Postecoglou, have been backed financially Club leadership feel they have come closer to winning more than just the 2008 League Cup in the Enic/Levy era having reached 15 semi-finals and six finals Sources who have worked with Levy say he does not communicate well enough and suggest the executive team are too similar, hence occasional “own goals” on policies. A banner asking for change was displayed at full-time after Tottenham lost at home to Leicester in January Football finance expert Kieran Maguire says any discussion of Levy’s tenure must be framed by Tottenham becoming the “most profitable club in Premier League history” because of the money their new stadium generates, a historically lower wage structure and a “degree of caution” on transfer spending. He describes Spurs as a “superb cash-making machine” who have “outperformed any other club in England”. Maguire outlined: His figures show that from 2001 to 2023, Tottenham made Â£171m profit. Burnley were second on Â£159m, with Arsenal third on Â£105m In the past decade, Spurs have the sixth-highest total wage bill in the Premier League (Â£1. 6bn vs Man City’s Â£2. 9bn as the highest); the sixth-highest transfer spend (Â£1. 3bn vs Chelsea’s Â£2. 8bn as the most); with the fifth-highest net spend over a similar period Tottenham fans pay among the highest season ticket prices and matchday prices in the top flight Levy has the highest chief executive pay of Premier League clubs that declare such data. In 2023, the most recent figures available, Spurs’ highest-paid director - unnamed but assumed to be Levy - earned Â£6. 6m. Daniel Levy has been Tottenham’s chairman since 2001 Club insiders describe Levy, 63, as “shy, quiet and hard-working” - and a man who loves the club and is affected by fan criticism. Multiple sources who know him have expressed respect for Tottenham’s progress under his leadership. One source with knowledge of the inner workings of the club, who wished to remain anonymous, said Levy can be “very ruthless” but “genuinely wants the best for Spurs”. They claimed some of the “own goals” - such as using the government furlough scheme during Covid in 2020 and more recently phasing out senior concession tickets - are partly because Levy does not “surround himself with the best people”. They described the executive leadership and club board, which includes operations and finance director Matthew Collecott and executive director Donna-Maria Cullen, as “people too similar to him” who will “sit with their heads in their phones”, rather than “people who make up for [Levy’s] weaknesses”. The source said Levy does not successfully deliver his messages about caring for the club because he is not a strong public speaker and chooses to avoid it, adding: “One interview or being visible once a year is not a lot. ” While Tottenham’s football structure has changed frequently, including technical directors, managing directors and heads of football operations, sources say the club rigidly sticks to “Levy’s philosophy and recruitment policy - to buy young players with promise who can add value”. Another source who has worked with Levy in the Spurs hierarchy, also speaking anonymously, backed his passion for the club and said the idea the chairman does not care because he rarely shows emotion is “nonsense”. They added that Levy is unrelenting - working “crazy” hours which can be tough and tiring for colleagues - and always wants more, something which can grate with people who do not like that style of leadership. From the archive: Inside Levy’s 20 years at Tottenham (2021) Postecoglou unsure on future - but why do many Spurs fans blame Levy? Is Postecoglou’s style causing Tottenham’s injury crisis? Sources at the club believe Levy will step aside when he feels it is right for Tottenham. They say he would not be motivated by vanity to stay on if there was an outright takeover - and the club remains open to investment with all future ownership structures on the table. While Levy may be the focal point of protests, it was stressed that he is a minority shareholder of the club through his own family trust - and Enic, itself mostly owned by the Lewis family trust, remains the majority owner. That means any change or purchase would need approval from the Lewis family, and there are other minority shareholders with a say. During the current protests, the THST has expressed frustration but has not called for Levy to leave, unlike CFT, which is a smaller splinter group looking to apply pressure in internal fan politics and towards the club. Other sources agreed the only realistic way in which Levy would leave Spurs would be on his own terms. He is the Premier League’s highest-paid chief executive - earning an estimated Â£50m-plus over his 25 years in charge. This week a Guardian article reported potential interest in Tottenham from an unnamed Qatari consortium, although sources with knowledge of Spurs’ ownership situation played it down. In 2023, when Paris St-Germain’s owners Qatari Sports Investment (QSI) were exploring the possibility of a minority stake in an English club, Tottenham were one of the teams linked. Levy maintains a close relationship with PSG and QSI chairman Nasser Al-Khelaifi. One source added that Levy - a renowned negotiator famously described by Sir Alex Ferguson as “more painful [to deal with] than a hip replacement” - will demand a high price for Spurs given their elite facilities, brand, London premium and the revenue the club now generates. Various reports in recent years have valued Tottenham at between Â£3. 5bn and Â£4bn. Chelsea were bought in a deal worth up to Â£4. 25bn from Roman Abramovich in 2022 by a consortium led by American investor Todd Boehly and private equity firm Clearlake Capital. The purchase price was Â£2. 5bn with a commitment to spending Â£1. 75bn over the next 10 years. Meanwhile, Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s Ineos bought a 25% stake in Manchester United for Â£1. 03bn in December 2023 in a process which included a rival bid from Qatar’s Sheikh Jassim, reported to be nearer to Â£5bn for 100% of the club. Despite those huge sums, both clubs - unlike Tottenham - need major investment in their stadiums to unlock bigger commercial earning potential. According to the first source, the period when Tottenham were building their new Â£1. 2bn stadium, between 2017 and 2019, meant Levy was “all-consumed” and the board “left everyone to do their jobs”. Spurs secured Champions League football under Mauricio Pochettino for four successive seasons to 2018-19 - and were beaten in the 2019 final by Liverpool. That source suggested Levy’s approach - namely “open to conversations but set in his ways” - has meant a lot of people with off-field expertise have left Spurs over the years for more influential jobs. Paul Barber was an executive director between 2005-2010 and is now Brighton chief executive; Michael Edwards was Spurs’ chief analyst from 2009-2011 before leaving for Liverpool; FA technical director John McDermott was Tottenham’s head of academy and player development until 2020; while EFL chief executive Trevor Birch was - very briefly - Tottenham’s director of football operations, from September 2020 to January 2021. It could be argued that many of these highly-rated executives enjoyed good careers at Tottenham before simply moving on - but the source claims they “left the building far too easily”. Another source to have worked closely with Levy at Spurs, again speaking anonymously, pointed out he has delivered “a core infrastructure that is probably the best in the world” and suggested that would give the club “an incredible foundation for future success - probably after Daniel’s time”. They said it had taken Arsenal 10 to 15 years to get back to competing for titles and regularly qualifying for Champions League football after they rebuilt their infrastructure, with Levy having inherited a dilapidated stadium, old training ground and ageing squad. However, the source suggested Levy has not yet got the “formula right” by employing the right head coach with the right players at the same time. One criticism some fans have consistently aimed at Levy and Tottenham’s executive board is a lack of understanding of what it takes to succeed on the pitch. Levy, Collecott and Cullen have worked together for a quarter of a century - one source described them as “the Holy Trinity to an extent” - with the chairman known to be “loyal to people loyal to him”. They are supported at the top level by director of football administration and governance Rebecca Caplehorn and non-executive director Jonathan Turner. The source said that in their experience at Tottenham there was no block on outside or different views, but it can be hard for newcomers especially those without an affinity to Spurs. They added that Levy, Collecott, 56, and Cullen, 61 are “probably an unbreakable group” given their longevity and close relationships, but did stress they will not be at Tottenham forever. It was suggested to BBC Sport that personal factors such as age and the trio’s own health or the health of relatives could lead them to “re-evaluate”. Sources inside the club accepted the various backgrounds of people on Tottenham’s board mean they know more about business than football, but pointed out that another six-person board - which includes chief football officer Scott Munn and technical director Johan Lange - sits underneath to advise on all football decisions. They will have a major say on any managerial appointments, while transfers are led by Lange and only finalised by Levy - with Munn running the rest of the football operation. Tottenham insiders accept they have not always spent well, and have made transfer mistakes in the past, but believe they have backed recent managers - including Postecoglou - and are happy with deals such as those for Dominic Solanke, Archie Gray and Lucas Bergvall. It is also felt that raising profits to record levels is the only way Tottenham can compete with teams like Man City and Newcastle and their ownership models. Spurs sources feel they have been close to winning more trophies than just one trophy in the Enic/Levy era - having reached 15 semi-finals and six finals - and the five other clubs in the ‘traditional top six’ are either richer or bigger. “We don’t make any apologies that we are trying to increase our revenue base to invest more in our teams if that means raising money through concerts to invest in the teams then I don’t apologise at all,” Levy said at September’s fan forum. “We announced with our last results that we believe this club needs a bigger capital base because we’ve got a lot of exciting projects on the horizon and we want to make further investment in the teams. Some form of minority investment is what we’re looking for. ” In a further defence of Levy, one source pointed to fan discontent at Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke in 2019 and 2021, as well as Manchester United’s 12 months of troubles under new co-owner Ratcliffe. They believe a “vocal minority” of fans simply want success now, but should be careful what they wish for with calls for change. They added: “Spurs haven’t got the formula on the pitch just yet but it will come. ” Latest Tottenham news, analysis and fan views Get Tottenham news sent straight to your phone "

    "body": "2025/02/02 - Let’s dive into the details: People not knowing about options to make their cervical screening easier and more comfortable is “costing lives”, a cancer charity warned last month. To find out what having the test is really like for first timers, the BBC spoke to six people who have had their first cervical screening, formerly known as a smear test, in the last six months. Cervical screenings, offered by the NHS to all women and people with a cervix aged 25-64, test for the presence of certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV), the virus that causes 99% of cervical cancers. During the test, a nurse uses a speculum - a tool to open the vagina - and a brush to take a sample of cells from the cervix. This is what having the test done for the first time was like for six people, and what they wish they’d known beforehand. Erica Donnelly, 26, who lives in Sunderland, waited about a year to book her screening appointment after receiving an invite. “I was in a massive panic about it because I have PTSD relating to sexual trauma, so I was really extra nervous about that,” she says. When she finally had the test done last month, she brought her partner with her for support and to help her in case she had a flashback or a panic attack. Having them there also made the experience feel more “comfortable and casual”, she says. Bianca Ionici, 27, who lives in London, says she put off her cervical screening “for at least two years” because of concerns about pain. But after getting another invite which contained a lot of information about the process, Bianca booked her screening in January. Other people say they booked their screenings as soon as they could. Eleanor Gratton, who had her test at the end of last year aged 25, says her friends were scared the process would be “uncomfortable and painful”. But as more and more people in her group had their screenings, she says they didn’t find this to be the case. Jessica Tse was “really anxious” before her cervical screening in December. “I didn’t know if it was going to hurt”, she says. But the nurse was “talking to me, distracting me throughout” and explained the procedure “really clearly”, she adds. “Pain-wise, it was uncomfortable and it was something I hadn’t felt before,” Bianca recalls. But “it was over before I knew”, she says. Others say they didn’t experience any discomfort - like Megan Burns, a social media content creator living in Brighton. “It was nothing,” says Megan, who had her first screening in September aged 25. “I couldn’t feel anything. ” She says the fact she’d already had two children made her less anxious about the experience. “These nurses have seen everything,” Megan adds. Some people feel under pressure to shave their pubic hair or wear their best underwear, she says. But speaking as a former healthcare worker, Megan says “you’re there to do a job, you don’t care about these things”. While most people only feel light pain at their appointments, some people do experience more discomfort at their appointments. “Some people find cervical screening uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful,” the Eve Appeal says. It notes that some conditions like endometriosis, vaginismus and being menopausal can make the screening painful. The NHS says that patients are in control of screening and “can ask the nurse to stop at any time”. People can ask for adjustments to make their screening easier or more comfortable. These include: But very few people are aware they can request these accommodations, according to recent research by the Eve Appeal. Less than a quarter of people surveyed said they knew they could request a smaller speculum and only 12% said they knew they could ask for a double appointment. Some of the people the BBC spoke to said they weren’t aware they could have asked for accommodations. Bianca says she asked the nurse to use a smaller speculum after reading about it online. But she thinks information about adjustments should be flagged more clearly when you book the appointment, because some need to be thought about in advance - like bringing a friend or booking a double slot. Jack Latham, a 28-year-old personal trainer living in Kent, says he received his first screening invite aged 25, just after he came out as trans. He says his GP was “incredibly supportive” and there was even a poster in his surgery’s waiting room encouraging trans men to have a cervical screening. Trans and non-binary people who have a cervix should still have regular cervical screenings. Jack says he’d put off the appointment out of fear, until he went for a blood test in summer 2024 and the nurse offered him a cervical screening on the spot. “It was so much quicker and much less of a bigger deal,” Jack says. “It’s nowhere near as bad as you think it will be. ” Some trans men previously told the BBC they had not been invited to get cervical screenings because they were listed as male on medical records, though they still had a cervix. The NHS wants to encourage more people to go for their cervical screenings. NHS England has promised to eliminate cervical cancer by 2040. Women aged 25-49 are encouraged to have a screening every three years, while women aged 50-64 should have one every five years. NHS England data from March 2024 showed 44. 5% of women aged 25-29 had not been screened in the last 3. 5 years. For those aged 30-34, this figure was 35. 3%. The proportion of younger women who have been adequately screened has been falling a little in recent years. Dr Sue Mann, NHS national clinical director for women’s health, told the BBC in a statement that medics know that some women find screenings “very worrying and uncomfortable”. She emphasised that adjustments are always available and that women should book their screenings, even if they were invited months or years ago. A display at the Vagina Museum in east London last year encouraged visitors to write improvements they’d like to see to the NHS’s cervical screening service on slips of paper. Artist Ella Clancy, who produced the display, says common requests included more information about the adjustments available - especially asking for smaller speculums - nurses talking people through exactly what they were doing as they performed the screening and staff being more trauma-aware. Eleanor says there should be more education around what HPV is. School pupils are typically vaccinated against HPV between year eight and year 10 but Eleanor says it wasn’t clear at the time what the jab was for. Jessica thinks doctors should explain the results using plainer language, and says she had to call her GP for further explanation after receiving her results letter. Some people prefer to carry out medical tests in the comfort of their own homes where possible. Do-it-yourself cervical tests are available in some countries, and researchers at King’s College London trialled them in London in 2021 with “fantastic” results. They involve doing a vaginal swab which is then sent to a lab. The NHS said last year it was assessing whether to roll the scheme out more widely. Eleanor says she felt “reassured” knowing that a healthcare professional performed her first screening, but would try doing an at-home version of the test after that if the option were available. Jack, on the other hand, has his doubts. He says he’d prefer an at-home kit for “the convenience and flexibility” but that he’d “have some hesitation about whether I’d done it correctly”.

NHS England data from March 2024 showed 44. 5% of women aged 25-29 had not been screened in the last 3. 5 years. For those aged 30-34, this figure was 35. 3%. The proportion of younger women who have been adequately screened has been falling a little in recent years. Dr Sue Mann, NHS national clinical director for women’s health, told the BBC in a statement that medics know that some women find screenings “very worrying and uncomfortable”. She emphasised that adjustments are always available and that women should book their screenings, even if they were invited months or years ago. A display at the Vagina Museum in east London last year encouraged visitors to write improvements they’d like to see to the NHS’s cervical screening service on slips of paper. Artist Ella Clancy, who produced the display, says common requests included more information about the adjustments available - especially asking for smaller speculums - nurses talking people through exactly what they were doing as they performed the screening and staff being more trauma-aware. Eleanor says there should be more education around what HPV is. School pupils are typically vaccinated against HPV between year eight and year 10 but Eleanor says it wasn’t clear at the time what the jab was for. Jessica thinks doctors should explain the results using plainer language, and says she had to call her GP for further explanation after receiving her results letter. Some people prefer to carry out medical tests in the comfort of their own homes where possible. Do-it-yourself cervical tests are available in some countries, and researchers at King’s College London trialled them in London in 2021 with “fantastic” results. They involve doing a vaginal swab which is then sent to a lab. The NHS said last year it was assessing whether to roll the scheme out more widely. Eleanor says she felt “reassured” knowing that a healthcare professional performed her first screening, but would try doing an at-home version of the test after that if the option were available. Jack, on the other hand, has his doubts. He says he’d prefer an at-home kit for “the convenience and flexibility” but that he’d “have some hesitation about whether I’d done it correctly”.

    "body": "2025/02/02 - Experts revealed that People not knowing about options to make their cervical screening easier and more comfortable is “costing lives”, a cancer charity warned last month. To find out what having the test is really like for first timers, the BBC spoke to six people who have had their first cervical screening, formerly known as a smear test, in the last six months. Cervical screenings, offered by the NHS to all women and people with a cervix aged 25-64, test for the presence of certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV), the virus that causes 99% of cervical cancers. During the test, a nurse uses a speculum - a tool to open the vagina - and a brush to take a sample of cells from the cervix. This is what having the test done for the first time was like for six people, and what they wish they’d known beforehand. Erica Donnelly, 26, who lives in Sunderland, waited about a year to book her screening appointment after receiving an invite. “I was in a massive panic about it because I have PTSD relating to sexual trauma, so I was really extra nervous about that,” she says. When she finally had the test done last month, she brought her partner with her for support and to help her in case she had a flashback or a panic attack. Having them there also made the experience feel more “comfortable and casual”, she says. Bianca Ionici, 27, who lives in London, says she put off her cervical screening “for at least two years” because of concerns about pain. But after getting another invite which contained a lot of information about the process, Bianca booked her screening in January. Other people say they booked their screenings as soon as they could. Eleanor Gratton, who had her test at the end of last year aged 25, says her friends were scared the process would be “uncomfortable and painful”. But as more and more people in her group had their screenings, she says they didn’t find this to be the case. Jessica Tse was “really anxious” before her cervical screening in December. “I didn’t know if it was going to hurt”, she says. But the nurse was “talking to me, distracting me throughout” and explained the procedure “really clearly”, she adds. “Pain-wise, it was uncomfortable and it was something I hadn’t felt before,” Bianca recalls. But “it was over before I knew”, she says. Others say they didn’t experience any discomfort - like Megan Burns, a social media content creator living in Brighton. “It was nothing,” says Megan, who had her first screening in September aged 25. “I couldn’t feel anything. ” She says the fact she’d already had two children made her less anxious about the experience. “These nurses have seen everything,” Megan adds. Some people feel under pressure to shave their pubic hair or wear their best underwear, she says. But speaking as a former healthcare worker, Megan says “you’re there to do a job, you don’t care about these things”. While most people only feel light pain at their appointments, some people do experience more discomfort at their appointments. “Some people find cervical screening uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful,” the Eve Appeal says. It notes that some conditions like endometriosis, vaginismus and being menopausal can make the screening painful. The NHS says that patients are in control of screening and “can ask the nurse to stop at any time”. People can ask for adjustments to make their screening easier or more comfortable. These include: But very few people are aware they can request these accommodations, according to recent research by the Eve Appeal. Less than a quarter of people surveyed said they knew they could request a smaller speculum and only 12% said they knew they could ask for a double appointment. Some of the people the BBC spoke to said they weren’t aware they could have asked for accommodations. Bianca says she asked the nurse to use a smaller speculum after reading about it online. But she thinks information about adjustments should be flagged more clearly when you book the appointment, because some need to be thought about in advance - like bringing a friend or booking a double slot. Jack Latham, a 28-year-old personal trainer living in Kent, says he received his first screening invite aged 25, just after he came out as trans. He says his GP was “incredibly supportive” and there was even a poster in his surgery’s waiting room encouraging trans men to have a cervical screening. Trans and non-binary people who have a cervix should still have regular cervical screenings. Jack says he’d put off the appointment out of fear, until he went for a blood test in summer 2024 and the nurse offered him a cervical screening on the spot. “It was so much quicker and much less of a bigger deal,” Jack says. “It’s nowhere near as bad as you think it will be. ” Some trans men previously told the BBC they had not been invited to get cervical screenings because they were listed as male on medical records, though they still had a cervix. The NHS wants to encourage more people to go for their cervical screenings. NHS England has promised to eliminate cervical cancer by 2040.

    "body": "2025/01/16 - Experts revealed that Emergency service teams, local councils and government officials will take part in a full, multi-day pandemic preparedness exercise, to help the UK prepare for potential future threats. The test, which is likely to take place in the autumn, will involve thousands of people across different parts of the UK, minister Pat McFadden has announced. The plans come in response to the first set of recommendations made by the Covid-19 Inquiry - the ongoing public inquiry into the handling of the pandemic. The chair of the inquiry, Baroness Hallett, found the UK was “ill-prepared” for the coronavirus pandemic, and “failed” its citizens. The national pandemic response exercise will be the first of its kind in nearly a decade, designed to test capabilities, plans and procedures in the face of new threats, the government says. The findings and lessons will be made public, as requested by Baroness Hallett, who made a series of recommendations in a 217-page report published in July 2023. Another measure will be a full test of the emergency alert system - which sounds an alarm through mobile phones - later this year. The alert has been used four times since its launch in 2023, including in areas hit hardest by recent storms. The government has also committed to training 4,000 people a year to be better prepared for crises such as pandemics, through a UK resilience academy, planned to open in April. The Covid-19 inquiry report found the pandemic had a disproportionate impact on vulnerable groups. A new national “vulnerability map” will be produced, Mr McFadden says, to highlight populations who may be vulnerable in a crisis, using data on age, disability, ethnicity and whether someone is receiving care. It is designed to help people get more targeted local support. Mr McFadden said: “We must learn lessons from the Covid pandemic, as we cannot afford to make the same mistakes again. “But we will plan in a way that recognises the next crisis may not be the same as the last. ” Pandemic planning and resilience are also about making sure the underlying fundamentals of the country are strong, he added. Baroness Hallett’s first report called for a major overhaul of the systems involved in preparing the country for civil emergencies. It also pointed out the UK lacked resilience, with high rates of ill-health and public services running close to - if not beyond - capacity. "

    "body": "2025/01/16 - Let’s dive into the details: The Covid inquiry is taking evidence from politicians, civil servants and health experts about the roll-out of vaccines and anti-viral treatment across the UK. In July 2024, the inquiry’s first report said the UK’s flawed pandemic preparations had led to more deaths and greater economic damage than there should have been. Just under 227,000 people died in the UK from Covid between March 2020 and May 2023, when the World Health Organization said the “global health emergency” was over. The Covid inquiry was launched by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson in June 2022, more than a year after he said the government’s actions would be put “under the microscope”. The announcement came after the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign said it was considering launching a judicial review over government “time-wasting”. Johnson said the inquiry would cover decision-making during the pandemic by the UK government, as well as the administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The first public hearings took place in London in June 2023. Subsequent hearings have been held in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast. Public inquiries are established and funded by the government and are led by an independent chair. They can compel witnesses to give evidence. No-one is found guilty or innocent, but the inquiry publishes conclusions and recommendations, which the government is not obliged to accept. Covid inquiry: The UK pandemic in numbers The inquiry is chaired by former judge and crossbench peer Baroness Hallett, who previously led the inquests into the 7 July London bombings. She said that loss and suffering would be at the heart of the inquiry, adding it would be “firmly independent”. Baroness Hallett promised the inquiry would be “thorough and fair” Baroness Hallett said the inquiry would examine how decisions on limiting the spread of Covid were made and communicated; the use of lockdowns and face coverings; and the impact on children, health and care sector workers, and the clinically vulnerable. She will also consider the effect on bereaved families, and how the findings could be applied to other national emergencies. Loss and suffering at heart of Covid inquiry Several reports are expected, covering everything from political decision-making to vaccines. Publishing the first of these in July 2024, Baroness Hallett said the UK was “ill-prepared for dealing with a catastrophic emergency, let alone the coronavirus pandemic”. “Never again can a disease be allowed to lead to so many deaths and so much suffering,” she added. The 217-page report, external argued the UK planned for the wrong pandemic - a mild one where spread of a new virus was inevitable - and this led to the “untested” policy of lockdown. It said the UK government and devolved nations “failed their citizens”, and that ministers did not sufficiently challenge scientific experts. It made a series of recommendations for reforming the way the government approaches emergency planning across the four nations of the UK. Baroness Hallett said she wanted these to be acted on quickly, with changes in place within six months or a year. The inquiry is split into different parts. , external Work on the first module, resilience and preparedness, external, has finished, but the inquiry is actively investigating several other aspects of Covid: decision-making and political governance in Westminster, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland the impact on healthcare systems across the UK vaccines, therapeutics and anti-viral treatment government procurement and PPE the care sector test-and-trace the impact on children and young people the government’s business and financial responses the impact on society There is no specific timescale for how long the inquiry will last, but Baroness Hallett aims to hold the final public hearings in 2026. Scotland is holding a separate inquiry into the pandemic. The inquiry has heard from hundreds of witnesses, including current and former politicians, civil servants, government advisers, public health experts and representatives of bereaved families. Many were extremely critical of former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was in No 10 throughout the pandemic. He began his two-day evidence session in December 2023 by apologising for the “pain and the loss and the suffering” experienced during the pandemic.

    "body": "2025/01/15 - According to new developments, Families of those harmed by Covid vaccines told the UK Covid Inquiry they were forced to support each other during the pandemic because there was no other help. Kate Scott, who represents the group Vaccine Injured and Bereaved UK (VIBUK), said they felt they were “almost being pushed into the shadows during the pandemic”. The inquiry also heard from a victims’ group in Scotland which raised concerns that the vaccine had been rolled out too quickly, and that safety had been sacrificed for speed. This is the Inquiry’s fourth module, which will consider issues relating to the development of Covid-19 vaccines and their implementation. Mrs Scott, whose husband Jamie was left severely disabled by a vaccine, said: “We are an uncomfortable truth, but we are a truth and the truth is for everyone in our group - the vaccine caused serious harm and death. ” Jamie Scott, a father of two boys, worked in a high-powered job until he was severely injured by a Covid vaccine. He spent four weeks and five days in a coma and suffered an extremely rare, life-threatening side effect called VITT, or vaccine-induced immune thrombosis and thrombocytopenia. Jamie survived, but suffered a significant brain injury, which affected his thinking processes. He is now partially blind and his wife says he will never live independently. Jamie has received £120,000 - the maximum payout from the government’s Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme. His wife, who is clear that neither of them is against vaccines, says he will never work again and that this is not a fair or adequate amount. “The scheme is inadequate and inefficient - offers too little too late and to too few,” she said. The inquiry heard that figures from a Freedom of Information request by VIBUK show that, as of 30 November 2024, victims and their families have made 17,519 claims to the scheme. Of these: Covid Inquiry chairwoman Baroness Heather Hallett spoke with a trembling voice as she told Jean Rossiter, whose son Peter died after contracting Covid-19: “I too am the mother of two sons of a similar age to Peter, so I can only imagine the pain and the grief that you are going through. ” Peter Rossiter was a highly talented, classical pianist who brought music to life while head of music in a school, Jean told the inquiry. However, despite being a key worker, he only received his first vaccine in May 2021 - five months after the first jab was given in the UK. That summer he was infected with Covid and became seriously ill, was admitted to intensive care in hospital but died on 11 August 2021. Peter had kept himself fit, said his mother Jean who helped set up the group Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK. “He followed the rules, we all did and it seems to us as parents that we did everything right and yet Peter lost his life still, as did so many of the families who’re in our group,” she said. Baroness Hallett said: “So many people said that Covid-19 only affects the older people. “You had a fit and healthy young son, under 40, and so it helps to remind people that we are not just about protecting people who some may think have had a good innings; we are about protecting the whole population. ” The bereaved families also raised concerns about: The Scottish Vaccine Injury Group (SVIG), which represents 750 people, said it had concerns that the vaccine had been rolled out too quickly and that safety had been sacrificed for speed. It also raised serious concerns about the government’s vaccine damage payment scheme. Ruth O’Rafferty, from the SVIG, said it was “a traumatic experience” for anyone applying. Being 60% disabled is a criteria for the award. She questioned how anyone could prove that when their condition fluctuates. She also said many of their members had suffered neurological damage and struggled to fill out forms. The inquiry will hear evidence over the next three weeks on this issue, in London. "

Kate Scott, who represents the group Vaccine Injured and Bereaved UK (VIBUK), said they felt they were “almost being pushed into the shadows during the pandemic”. The inquiry also heard from a victims’ group in Scotland which raised concerns that the vaccine had been rolled out too quickly, and that safety had been sacrificed for speed. This is the Inquiry’s fourth module, which will consider issues relating to the development of Covid-19 vaccines and their implementation. Mrs Scott, whose husband Jamie was left severely disabled by a vaccine, said: “We are an uncomfortable truth, but we are a truth and the truth is for everyone in our group - the vaccine caused serious harm and death. ” Jamie Scott, a father of two boys, worked in a high-powered job until he was severely injured by a Covid vaccine. He spent four weeks and five days in a coma and suffered an extremely rare, life-threatening side effect called VITT, or vaccine-induced immune thrombosis and thrombocytopenia. Jamie survived, but suffered a significant brain injury, which affected his thinking processes. He is now partially blind and his wife says he will never live independently. Jamie has received £120,000 - the maximum payout from the government’s Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme. His wife, who is clear that neither of them is against vaccines, says he will never work again and that this is not a fair or adequate amount. “The scheme is inadequate and inefficient - offers too little too late and to too few,” she said. The inquiry heard that figures from a Freedom of Information request by VIBUK show that, as of 30 November 2024, victims and their families have made 17,519 claims to the scheme. Of these: Covid Inquiry chairwoman Baroness Heather Hallett spoke with a trembling voice as she told Jean Rossiter, whose son Peter died after contracting Covid-19: “I too am the mother of two sons of a similar age to Peter, so I can only imagine the pain and the grief that you are going through. ” Peter Rossiter was a highly talented, classical pianist who brought music to life while head of music in a school, Jean told the inquiry.

    "title": "Update: Assisted dying bill - What is in proposed law?",
    "body": "2024/11/29 - According to new developments, MPs have voted in favour of proposals to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales. The bill will now face many more months of debate and scrutiny by MPs and peers, who could choose to amend it, with the approval of both Houses of Parliament needed for it to become law. It is also possible the bill could fall and not become law at all. The bill - called the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill - would make it legal for over-18s who are terminally ill to be given assistance to end their own life. But there are requirements: Under the bill, a doctor could prepare the “approved” substance (the bill does not detail what medication this is) but the person themselves must take it. No doctor or anyone else would be allowed to administer the medication to the terminally ill person. The doctor would stay with the person until they had self-administered the substance and died (or the doctor determines the procedure has failed). The person could decide not to take it, in which case the doctor would have to remove the substance immediately. Doctors would also not be under any obligation to take part in the assisted dying process. This is called physician-assisted suicide. Voluntary euthanasia is different and is where a health professional administers the drugs to the patient. Deaths covered by the assisted suicide bill would not need to be investigated by a coroner. But the bill would make it illegal for someone to pressure, coerce or use dishonesty to get someone to make a declaration that they wish to end their life or to induce someone to self-administer an approved substance. If someone is found guilty of either of these actions, they could face a jail sentence of up to 14 years. What’s not included in the bill is how much the system would cost, who would pay and what the workload would be. And there is no detail about the judicial process - namely, how the evidence would be put before the High Court judge. Lord Thomas, former Lord Chief Justice, told the BBC’s Today Programme that it cannot be a “rubber stamping process” and judges must be satisfied there is no coercion. The person seeking assisted dying would be advised to consider telling their family and GP, but would not legally have to. The law would apply to England and Wales. A separate bill is already under discussion in Scotland. Meanwhile, politicians in Jersey and the Isle of Man have already backed plans to introduce assisted dying and the process to bring in legislation is under way. "

    "title": "Latest: NHS hours from PPE running out in Covid - Hancock",
    "body": "2024/11/21 - Let’s dive into the details: The NHS in England came within “six or seven hours” of running out of gowns and other protective equipment during the Covid pandemic, Matt Hancock has said. The former health secretary was giving evidence for the third time at the Covid inquiry, about the impact on healthcare systems. He stated there was never a “national shortage” of PPE for healthcare workers but “in some places, they did run out - and it was awful”. Asked about reports that some nurses had to wear binbags early in the Covid crisis, he said the NHS needed to “learn the lessons of what went wrong” and put in place “better stockpiles” for the future. Mr Hancock - who was health secretary at the start of the pandemic in 2020 - will be giving evidence over two days, as the inquiry investigates the impact on the NHS and healthcare across all four UK nations. On Thursday, the inquiry’s chair, Baroness Hallett, had to occasionally interrupt the hearing to tell bereaved families in the public gallery - some of whom were clearly highly emotional - to lower photographs of their deceased relatives. Earlier, the former MP faced robust questioning about the squeeze on facilities many hospitals had endured at the peak of the two most significant waves of Covid. In March 2020, Mr Hancock said he was “petrified” newly announced lockdown rules might not be stringent enough to avoid a repeat of scenes in northern Italy, where some Covid patients had struggled to access any care. But while some hospitals in England came under “extraordinary pressure”, the wider NHS system was never overwhelmed, he added. Mr Hancock was then asked about the case of Suzie Sullivan, who died of Covid in 2020. Medical notes written at the time stated Suzie was not suitable for a transfer to intensive care due to a pre-existing heart condition and having Down’s syndrome. Her father, John, told an earlier session of the inquiry she was “left to die” because of her disability. Mr Hancock accepted that a bed in intensive care could not be found for every individual patient who needed it at the height of the pandemic. “Of course there was enormous pressure, and of course, it has consequences,” he said. He said, at times, staff ratios had to be stretched, meaning specialist critical care nurses had to look after six patients rather than give the one-to-one care they would in normal times. But he added: “What we successfully avoided, was an overall rationing - to say, ‘people, according to these characteristics, aren’t going to be cared for’. ” “That’s what would have happened if we had let the virus get more out of control. “Did people get as good care as they would have done in normal times? Of course not. There was a pandemic,” he told the inquiry. Asked about the imposed visiting restrictions, which meant some relatives could not be with dying family members in their final hours, and elsewhere, expectant fathers could not attend ante-natal scans, he said “on balance” he believed the government got the rules “about right”. “Where I think we got it wrong, for instance, was the way that the funeral guidance was applied on the ground - it wasn’t as had been intended. ” Other witnesses, including the first minister of Wales, Eluned Morgan, and Scotland’s former health minister Jeane Freeman, have suggested some of those restrictions, or they way they were implemented, might have gone too far. Mr Hancock also defended the government’s ‘Stay Home, Save Lives, Protect the NHS’ messaging, saying that it was “literally true” that “if we didn’t stop the spread of the virus, the NHS would be overwhelmed”. Giving evidence recently, England’s chief medical officer, Prof Sir Chris Whitty, said, with hindsight, the authorities did not suceed in letting the public know the NHS was still open for non-Covid patients during the pandemic. Mr Hancock alluded to how he had had to “ruffle some feathers” to protect the NHS from political interference. He said he felt it was his job to “shield” the health service from “people being difficult in Number 10”. Some of the interference by political appointees in Downing Street caused “incredible difficulties” when it came to rolling out Covid testing, he added. "

    "title": "Update: Covid inquiry told Treasury blocked NHS bed request",
    "body": "2024/11/11 - It has been recently reported that Boris Johnson’s government blocked a request to fund another 10,000 hospital beds at the height of the Covid pandemic, the chief executive of NHS England has said. Amanda Pritchard told the UK Covid-19 Inquiry the decision, made by the Treasury in July 2020, had been “very disappointing”. Extra beds and staff would have been used to cut waiting lists for planned care and “build resilience” going into a second winter wave of the pandemic, she said. The government has said it cannot comment while the inquiry is in progress. Health ministers from the time are expected to give evidence later this month, to the third section of the inquiry, looking at Covid’s impact on the NHS and healthcare systems across the UK. Ms Pritchard served as NHS England’s chief operating officer from 2019 until she was promoted to chief executive, in August 2021. In her evidence, she said a request had been made to the government, for 10,000 extra permanent, staffed hospital beds, in July 2020. The demand had been based on modelling the spread of the virus, along with the need to deal with other pressures that coming winter and resume more planned, or elective, surgery and other treatments for non-Covid patients. But the inquiry heard the Treasury and the prime minister’s private office had refused the request, saying they wanted more use made of temporary Nightingale hospitals along with the private sector. And Ms Prichard had been told the decision would be looked at again as part of a wider spending review expected in the autumn of 2021. She called the decision “very disappointing”, saying waiting lists for planned NHS treatment in England would be in “quite a different position” today had the extra funding been agreed. “If we had had that capacity, we could certainly have treated thousands more patients… as well as being more resilient going into the second wave of the pandemic and into winter more generally,” Ms Prichard said. In the summer of 2020, the NHS in England had a total permanent bed capacity to treat about 95,000 patients in acute hospitals. That was increased by another 4,000 from winter 2023, under a recovery plan agreed by then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Later in her evidence, Ms Pritchard said the health service had faced a period of “extreme pressure” in the winter of 2020-21, as another wave of Covid spread across the country. By that point, new treatments had been discovered, including the cheap steroid dexamethasone, and the first Covid vaccines were starting to be rolled out in small numbers. But the level of community transmission at the time meant some intensive-care units were still being pushed “to the brink” and were “right on the edge” of running out of bed space. Nationally, the health service had never had to “systematically limit” access to treatments because hospitals could not cope with demand, Ms Pritchard said. “That does not mean, though, that it did not feel completely overwhelming to staff at this time in those places - and it does not mean that the kind of care that was being provided was anything like normal,” she added. Ms Pritchard was also asked about the seven temporary Nightingale hospitals built quickly, in March and April 2020, across England to treat Covid patients. Data seen by the inquiry shows the total cost to the taxpayer, including setting up and decommissioning, is now estimated at £358. 5m. The hospitals – in Birmingham, Bristol, Exeter, Harrogate, London, Manchester and Sunderland – treated 141 Covid patients in the first wave of the virus and 1,097 Covid and other patients in the second wave. In total, £50. 4m was spent on one site, Birmingham, which was never used by patients in the pandemic. The site in Bristol also carried out 6,554 assessments for patients from the eye hospital in the city. Ms Pritchard told the inquiry the programme had still been “useful”, as the sites had been envisaged as “military field hospitals” at the time. “We thought we were doing it to avoid a northern Italy situation,” she said, referring to scenes in Lombardy, where intensive-care units had been overwhelmed.

She called the decision “very disappointing”, saying waiting lists for planned NHS treatment in England would be in “quite a different position” today had the extra funding been agreed. “If we had had that capacity, we could certainly have treated thousands more patients… as well as being more resilient going into the second wave of the pandemic and into winter more generally,” Ms Prichard said. In the summer of 2020, the NHS in England had a total permanent bed capacity to treat about 95,000 patients in acute hospitals. That was increased by another 4,000 from winter 2023, under a recovery plan agreed by then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Later in her evidence, Ms Pritchard said the health service had faced a period of “extreme pressure” in the winter of 2020-21, as another wave of Covid spread across the country. By that point, new treatments had been discovered, including the cheap steroid dexamethasone, and the first Covid vaccines were starting to be rolled out in small numbers. But the level of community transmission at the time meant some intensive-care units were still being pushed “to the brink” and were “right on the edge” of running out of bed space. Nationally, the health service had never had to “systematically limit” access to treatments because hospitals could not cope with demand, Ms Pritchard said. “That does not mean, though, that it did not feel completely overwhelming to staff at this time in those places - and it does not mean that the kind of care that was being provided was anything like normal,” she added. Ms Pritchard was also asked about the seven temporary Nightingale hospitals built quickly, in March and April 2020, across England to treat Covid patients. Data seen by the inquiry shows the total cost to the taxpayer, including setting up and decommissioning, is now estimated at £358. 5m. The hospitals – in Birmingham, Bristol, Exeter, Harrogate, London, Manchester and Sunderland – treated 141 Covid patients in the first wave of the virus and 1,097 Covid and other patients in the second wave. In total, £50. 4m was spent on one site, Birmingham, which was never used by patients in the pandemic. The site in Bristol also carried out 6,554 assessments for patients from the eye hospital in the city. Ms Pritchard told the inquiry the programme had still been “useful”, as the sites had been envisaged as “military field hospitals” at the time. “We thought we were doing it to avoid a northern Italy situation,” she said, referring to scenes in Lombardy, where intensive-care units had been overwhelmed.

    "title": "Update: Covid inquiry told top NHS doctor was terrified",
    "body": "2024/11/07 - It has been recently reported that The most senior doctor in NHS England has said he was “personally terrified” that hospitals could have been overwhelmed in the early stages of the pandemic. Prof Sir Stephen Powis told the Covid inquiry officials had drawn up a draft document advising whose care should be prioritised if the NHS found itself unable to cope with the surge in patients. The ‘Covid-19 decision tool’ assigned points based on a patient’s age, frailty and underlying conditions. A high score meant they might not be admitted to intensive care if services were overwhelmed. The tool was never issued publicly, after it became clear infections might have already reached a peak in March 2020. Sir Stephen, who still serves as national medical director at NHS England, said the senior clinicians who were asked to draw up the plans at short notice “did a magnificent job” that “nobody ever wants to do”. “But it became absolutely clear to me that this was going to be controversial, [and] that it hadn’t had the opportunity to be discussed more widely with patient groups, [or] with the public,” he added. The draft document advised doctors to score Covid patients based on three criteria, using a frailty scale. It detailed how those with a total score of more than eight points should not be admitted to intensive care if services became overwhelmed. Patients aged 70 to 75 were to be automatically assigned four points, while those aged over 80 would receive six. Extra points would be added for chronic conditions, such as heart disease or diabetes. People who were terminally ill, with a life expectancy of less than six months, would automatically be given nine points. Sir Stephen said work on the guidance document had started early in the pandemic, at a time when the number of patients in intensive care in England was doubling every 5-7 days. “It was not clear that the public would respond to lockdown - they did wonderfully - but that wasn’t clear [at that point],” he said. “Frankly, I was personally terrified that the NHS was going to be overwhelmed. ” The project was halted on 28 March 2020, after it became clear the peak of the first Covid wave was approaching and the health service would not “breach capacity”. Sir Stephen said there was also a danger the point-scoring system could have been “used inappropriately”, replacing the individual clinical judgement of doctors. “My recommendation to the inquiry is that we should absolutely, in the future, not try and develop one of these tools in the midst of a pandemic,” he added. He said it was a piece of work that needed to be carried out in consultation with the public “in normal times”. “In my view, it’s a discussion that shouldn’t be government-led, it shouldn’t even be led by the profession, it needs to be located within society. ” "

The government’s Tobacco and Vapes Bill proposes to outlaw vape advertising and sponsorship, external, and to restrict the flavours, packaging and display of vapes and other nicotine products. â¯ Outdoor vaping may also be banned in smoke-free places, subject to consultation. Separately, the government had already announced that disposable vapes will be banned in England, Wales and Scotland from 1 June 2025. Northern Ireland is expected to follow suit. The move is designed to protect children and young people’s health, and to reduce environmental damage. It covers single-use vapes which cannot be refilled or recharged, external. Previous Conservative government plans to limit vaping and smoking had not become law by the time of the July general election, so Labour has brought in its own legislation. How will the UK smoking ban work? Vaping products are already subject to 20% VAT but, unlike tobacco, they do not attract a separate additional tax. As part of the Autumn Budget, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced that a vaping products duty will start on 1 October 2026. It will be charged at a flat rate of Â£2. 20 per 10ml vaping liquid. At the same time, tobacco duty will be increased to preserve the financial incentive to switch to vaping. Vaping is nowhere near as harmful as smoking cigarettes. However, health experts agree anyone who does not smoke should not start vaping, as it may cause long-term damage to lungs, hearts and brains. The vapour inhaled contains a small amount of chemicals, often including the addictive substance nicotine. More research is needed to fully understand their health effects, but in December 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that “alarming evidence” about the risks they pose was growing, external.

Cigarettes contain tobacco, tar and a range of other toxic cancer-causing chemicals, and are one of the largest preventable causes of illness and death in the UK, external. That is why smokers are urged to stop, with nicotine vapes the most effective quit tool - better than nicotine patches or gum. , external Research suggests people using vapes alongside face-to-face support can be up to twice as likely to stop smoking, external than those using other methods. But because vaping is not harmless, it is only recommended for adult smokers, who are offered free vape kits on the NHS to help them quit as part of its “swap to stop” programme. The NHS says thousands of people have given up smoking using vaping. NHS: Vaping myths and facts, external Jordan North: How safe is vaping for my health? As smoking rates have fallen, the use of vapes has risen, with about 5. 1 million people using a vape or e-cigarette in 2023. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) says 5. 9% of people aged 16 and over vaped every day, up slightly from the previous year, while another 3. 9% did so occasionally. The group with the highest rate of vape use - nearly 16% - was 16-24 year-olds. But the biggest increase in vape use since 2022 was seen among 25-34-year-olds. The number of people in England who vape despite never having been regular smokers has increased significantly, according to research published in The Lancet. It found e-cigarette use among this group has increased from one in 200 people in 2021, to one in 28 - just over a million people. It is illegal to sell vapes containing nicotine to under-18s, but their use among younger teenagers has grown. Nearly 8% of 11-17-year-olds vaped in April 2023, according to an online survey of 2,000 children by health charity ASH (Action on Smoking and Health), external. That was up from 4% in 2020. Vaping is now twice as common as smoking among children. Almost five million single-use vapes were either littered or added to general waste each week in 2023, according to the Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs (Defra). Batteries thrown into household waste cause hundreds of fires in bin lorries and waste-processing centres every year. As well as lithium-ion batteries, vapes also contain circuit boards which - if not disposed of properly - can leach toxic compounds such as cobalt and copper into the environment as they degrade. These minerals and the lithium could, if recovered, be reused for green technologies such as electric car batteries or in wind turbines, external. In 2022, vapes with more than 40 tonnes of lithium in vapes were discarded, enough to power 5,000 electric vehicles. However, recycling vapes is not straightforward because of their size and the way they are manufactured, which makes them difficult to take apart. There is currently no large-scale disposable vape recycling in the UK, external. There are so many different types of vape on the market that it is difficult to develop a standard recycling process. Research published in 2023 suggested only 17% of users recycled disposable vapes. The US has prohibited some vape flavours like mint and fruit in particular e-cigarettes. However, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reversed the 2022 ban on products sold by Juul, one of the country’s biggest e-cigarette companies. It said a full review of Juul’s products was pending. The company previously settled more than 5,000 US vaping legal actions, after being accused of targeting teenagers.

New Zealand brought in new rules in 2023, banning most disposable vapes and targeting flavours which appeal to children.

    "body": "2024/11/05 - According to new developments, The government is tightening up the rules about how vapes are marketed and sold, alongside wider plans to tackle health issues caused by smoking. A ban on disposable vapes will also be introduced and a new tax on nicotine vapes put in place. The government’s Tobacco and Vapes Bill proposes to outlaw vape advertising and sponsorship, external, and to restrict the flavours, packaging and display of vapes and other nicotine products. â¯ Outdoor vaping may also be banned in smoke-free places, subject to consultation. Separately, the government had already announced that disposable vapes will be banned in England, Wales and Scotland from 1 June 2025. Northern Ireland is expected to follow suit. The move is designed to protect children and young people’s health, and to reduce environmental damage. It covers single-use vapes which cannot be refilled or recharged, external. Previous Conservative government plans to limit vaping and smoking had not become law by the time of the July general election, so Labour has brought in its own legislation. How will the UK smoking ban work? Vaping products are already subject to 20% VAT but, unlike tobacco, they do not attract a separate additional tax. As part of the Autumn Budget, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced that a vaping products duty will start on 1 October 2026. It will be charged at a flat rate of Â£2. 20 per 10ml vaping liquid. At the same time, tobacco duty will be increased to preserve the financial incentive to switch to vaping. Vaping is nowhere near as harmful as smoking cigarettes. However, health experts agree anyone who does not smoke should not start vaping, as it may cause long-term damage to lungs, hearts and brains. The vapour inhaled contains a small amount of chemicals, often including the addictive substance nicotine. More research is needed to fully understand their health effects, but in December 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that “alarming evidence” about the risks they pose was growing, external. Illegal vapes are also widely available and are much more likely to contain other harmful chemicals or drugs. Cigarettes contain tobacco, tar and a range of other toxic cancer-causing chemicals, and are one of the largest preventable causes of illness and death in the UK, external. That is why smokers are urged to stop, with nicotine vapes the most effective quit tool - better than nicotine patches or gum. , external Research suggests people using vapes alongside face-to-face support can be up to twice as likely to stop smoking, external than those using other methods. But because vaping is not harmless, it is only recommended for adult smokers, who are offered free vape kits on the NHS to help them quit as part of its “swap to stop” programme. The NHS says thousands of people have given up smoking using vaping. NHS: Vaping myths and facts, external Jordan North: How safe is vaping for my health? As smoking rates have fallen, the use of vapes has risen, with about 5. 1 million people using a vape or e-cigarette in 2023. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) says 5. 9% of people aged 16 and over vaped every day, up slightly from the previous year, while another 3. 9% did so occasionally. The group with the highest rate of vape use - nearly 16% - was 16-24 year-olds. But the biggest increase in vape use since 2022 was seen among 25-34-year-olds. The number of people in England who vape despite never having been regular smokers has increased significantly, according to research published in The Lancet. It found e-cigarette use among this group has increased from one in 200 people in 2021, to one in 28 - just over a million people. It is illegal to sell vapes containing nicotine to under-18s, but their use among younger teenagers has grown. Nearly 8% of 11-17-year-olds vaped in April 2023, according to an online survey of 2,000 children by health charity ASH (Action on Smoking and Health), external. That was up from 4% in 2020. Vaping is now twice as common as smoking among children. Almost five million single-use vapes were either littered or added to general waste each week in 2023, according to the Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs (Defra). Batteries thrown into household waste cause hundreds of fires in bin lorries and waste-processing centres every year. As well as lithium-ion batteries, vapes also contain circuit boards which - if not disposed of properly - can leach toxic compounds such as cobalt and copper into the environment as they degrade. These minerals and the lithium could, if recovered, be reused for green technologies such as electric car batteries or in wind turbines, external. In 2022, vapes with more than 40 tonnes of lithium in vapes were discarded, enough to power 5,000 electric vehicles. However, recycling vapes is not straightforward because of their size and the way they are manufactured, which makes them difficult to take apart. There is currently no large-scale disposable vape recycling in the UK, external. There are so many different types of vape on the market that it is difficult to develop a standard recycling process. Research published in 2023 suggested only 17% of users recycled disposable vapes. The US has prohibited some vape flavours like mint and fruit in particular e-cigarettes. However, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reversed the 2022 ban on products sold by Juul, one of the country’s biggest e-cigarette companies. It said a full review of Juul’s products was pending. The company previously settled more than 5,000 US vaping legal actions, after being accused of targeting teenagers. In Australia e-cigarettes containing nicotine are generally available on prescription only,, external for smokers who want to give up tobacco. And pharmacies do not sell disposable vapes. New Zealand brought in new rules in 2023, banning most disposable vapes and targeting flavours which appeal to children. Countries including South Korea, India and Brazil have also brought in very strict vape rules, while China has announced restrictions. However, 88 countries have no minimum age for buying vapes, and 74 have no laws in place for e-cigarettes, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), external. "

    "body": "2024/10/31 - Let’s dive into the details: Tax rises and higher staffing costs announced in the Budget could force some care homes to close, providers have warned. Social care will be hit by a hike in the rate of National Insurance contributions paid by employers as well as increases to the minimum wage. The sector welcomed an extra £600m in funding to local authorities for adult and children’s social care. But care groups said this would not be enough and would be “wiped off instantly” by increased staffing costs. The Liberal Democrats have called on the government to exempt social care from the rise in National Insurance. The party said the chancellor had provided extra funding for the NHS and other public sector organisations to cover the cost of the tax rise - but because the vast majority of care providers are private they would not benefit from this. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s World at One programme, Health Secretary Wes Streeting confirmed the NHS would be refunded for the rise in National Insurance contributions. However, pressed on whether private social care companies would still have to pay the increased rate, he pointed to the extra £600m allocated for the sector. “The chancellor has taken into account those pressures when making funding decisions,” he added. Care England, which represents adult social care providers, said without further support the sector was in “unprecedented danger” and the closure of services that were no longer viable was likely. It said the £600m in funding was “a drop in the ocean compared to the staggering £2. 4bn in rising costs associated with wage increases and employer national insurance contributions”. Mike Padgham runs five residential and nursing homes in North Yorkshire supporting older and disabled people. He has 210 staff, and his current wage bill is £5. 3m a year. He estimates each month the increase in employers’ National Insurance will cost an extra £5,000, and the increase in the minimum wage will add another £25,000. Most of his residents are funded by the local authority and Mr Padgham says he will have to ask for higher fees. But care providers have long complained financially squeezed councils do not pay enough to cover the real costs of care. Mr Padgham, who chairs the Independent Care Group, which represents independent providers, said that as a labour-intensive sector an increase in employee costs was “the last thing social care needed”. “For a lot of providers this will place existential pressure on them and could well push some out of business, unless it is matched by extra funding to those who commission care and there was little sign of that,” he said. He said the extra £600m for social care would have “little or no impact” once shared between 152 local authorities and children’s services. He added: “Any extra funding that might reach providers will be wiped off instantly by the increases in National Insurance and minimum pay which will together heap further pressure on social care providers. ” Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the increase in National Insurance “risks worsening the NHS crisis by hiking costs for care providers and pushing some to the brink”. He added: “It just shows that yet again the government seems to have forgotten about care. ” "

    "title": "Latest: How close were hospitals to collapse in Covid?",
    "body": "2024/10/28 - According to new developments, Listen to Jim read this article Five times Prof Kevin Fong broke down in tears in a nondescript hearing room in West London, while giving evidence to the Covid inquiry. The 53-year-old has the kind of CV that makes you pay attention: a consultant anaesthetist in London who also works for the air ambulance service and specialises in space medicine. In 2020, as Covid spread around the world, he was seconded to NHS England and sent out to the worst hit areas to support other medics. We’ve long been told that hospitals were struggling to cope during the pandemic. In January 2021, then prime minister Boris Johnson warned the NHS was “under unprecedented pressure”. But now many hours of testimony to the Covid inquiry this autumn is offering our clearest understanding yet of what was really going on at the height of the pandemic. The inquiry restarts its live hearings this week with evidence from doctors and patient groups. Health ministers and senior NHS managers are also expected to appear before the end of the year. I was at the inquiry the day Prof Fong calmly talked through more than 40 visits he led to intensive care units, his voice cracking at times. What Prof Fong discovered at the hospitals he visited was something he said could not be found in the official NHS data or the main evening news bulletins at the time. “It really was like nothing else I’ve ever seen,” he said. “These people were used to seeing death but not on that scale, and not like that. ” In late 2020, for example, he was sent to a midsize district hospital somewhere in England that was “bursting at the seams”. This was just as the second wave of Covid was hitting its peak. England was days away from its third national lockdown. The first vaccines were being rolled out but not yet in large numbers. In that hospital, he found the intensive care unit, the overflow areas and the respiratory wards all full with Covid patients. The previous night someone had died in an ambulance outside waiting to be admitted. The same thing had happened that morning. The staff were “in total bits”. Some of the nurses were wearing adult nappies or using patient commodes because there wasn’t time for toilet breaks. One told him: “It was overwhelming, the things we would normally do to help people didn’t work. It was too much. ” That night, Prof Fong and his team helped to transfer 17 critically ill patients to other NHS sites – an emergency measure unheard of outside the pandemic. “It is the closest I have ever seen a hospital to being in a state of operational collapse,” he said. “It was just a scene from hell. ” In the pandemic we heard reports of swamped hospitals in danger of being overwhelmed though to what extent was never fully clear. On the face of it bed occupancy in England – that’s the total number of hospital beds taken up by all patients – did not hit more than 90% in January 2021, the peak of the largest Covid wave. That’s above the 85% level considered safe but not any higher than a typical winter outside the pandemic. That doesn’t tell the full story. At that point hospitals had cancelled all their usual planned work – from hip replacements to hernia repairs. Strict Covid rules meant the public were told to stay at home and protect the NHS. The numbers coming in through A&amp;E in England fell by almost 40% compared to the previous year, to 1. 3 million in January 2021. That was why, when anti-lockdown protestors sneaked into hospitals to film, they found deserted corridors and rows of empty seats. The pressure though was often being felt elsewhere – on the main wards and in intensive care units (ICUs), where thousands of the sickest Covid patients needed help to breathe on ventilators. “At our peak we ran out of physical bed spaces and had to resort to putting two patients into one space,” one ICU nurse at a different hospital told Prof Fong. “Patients were dying daily, bad news was being broken over the phone or via an iPad. ” Later research by the Intensive Care Society found that in January 2021, 6,099 ICU beds were filled across the UK, well above the pre-Covid capacity of 3,848. This huge spike in demand, equivalent to building another 141 entire intensive care units, was being driven by the length of time Covid patients needed treatment. On average they would spend 16 days in ICU, normally on a ventilator, compared with just four to seven days for a patient admitted for another reason. As a result, hospitals had to rush to convert operating theatres, side rooms or other wards into makeshift intensive care units. NHS trusts often ended up juggling shortages of equipment, medicines and oxygen. But while it might have been possible to cram in more beds, finding the extra skilled workers to staff them was far more difficult. Prof Charlotte Summers, who led the intensive care team at Addenbrooke’s hospital in Cambridge, said: “We can’t just magic up specialist care staff because it takes a good couple of years, at least, for minimum critical care speciality training. ” “What we had, we had, and we had to stretch further and further. ” As a result staffing ratios were pushed to the limit in Covid, something she said politicians, the media and the public didn’t fully understand at the time. Outside of a pandemic, specialist critical care nurses would be responsible for just a single patient. In Covid they were looking after four, five or even six – often all on a ventilator. “Staff didn’t have time to process or accept the losses,” the lead ICU matron at one large teaching hospital told Prof Fong. “As soon as one patient had passed away they had to get the bed cleared and ready for the next patient. ” Others in intensive care and Covid wards – from doctors to pharmacists to dietitians – saw their workloads stretched well beyond normal safe levels. This was the main reason why temporary Nightingale hospitals, built in the first Covid wave at a cost of more than £500m, only ever treated a handful of patients. It was possible to build the critical care infrastructure almost overnight, but quite another thing to find trained medics to work in them. To help plug these staff shortages in ICU, volunteers were frequently brought in from other parts of the hospital, often with no experience of intensive care medicine or of dealing with that level of trauma and death. “They were being exposed to things which they wouldn’t necessarily be [exposed to] in their normal jobs, people deteriorating and dying in front of them, the emotional distress of that,” said Dr Ganesh Suntharalingam, an ICU doctor and former president of the Intensive Care Society. Another hospital doctor said he felt some junior members of staff were “thrown in at the deep end” with little training and no choice about where they were sent. The inquiry heard that all this “inevitably” had an impact on some of the sickest patients. At no point did the NHS have to impose a formal ‘national triage’, where someone was refused treatment because they could not get a hospital bed. But using that as measure of health system collapse may be too simplistic anyway. Prof Summers said it would be mistake to think of “catastrophic failure” as a switch that goes “from everything being okay to everything not being okay the next second. ” “It is in the dilution of a million and one tiny little things, particularly in intensive care. ” She said when the system becomes so overstretched it feels like “we are failing our patients” and not providing the care “that we would want for our own families”. New research suggests those hospital units under the greatest pressure also saw the highest mortality rates for both Covid and non-Covid cases. Difficult decisions were having to be made about which of the sickest patients to move up to intensive care. Those Covid patients who needed CPAP, a form of pressurised oxygen support, rather than a ventilator, often had to be cared for in general wards instead, where staff may have been less used to the technology. One anonymous ICU doctor in Wales said: “We didn’t have enough space to ‘give people a go’ who had a very remote chance of getting better. If we had had more capacity, we might have been in a position to try. ” The inquiry was also told that at least one NHS trust was under so much pressure it implemented a blanket “do-not-resuscitate order” at the height of the pandemic. If a patient went into cardiac arrest or stopped breathing, it would mean they should not be given chest compressions or defibrillation to try to save their life. In normal times, that difficult decision should only be made after an individual clinical assessment, and a discussion with the patient or their family. But Prof Jonathan Wyllie, ex-president of the Resuscitation Council, said he knew of one unnamed trust that put in place a blanket order based instead on age, condition and disability. Groups representing bereaved families said they were horrified, adding it was “irrefutable evidence the NHS was overwhelmed”. At times, the impact on intensive care was so great that some units had to undergo “rapid depressurisation” with dozens of patients transferred out, sometimes over long distances, to other hospitals. Before the pandemic, from December 2019 to February 2020, only 68 of these capacity transfers had taken place in England. Between December 2020 and February 2021, 2,152 were needed, either by road or air ambulance. Often it was the most stable patients in smaller district hospitals who would be selected for transfer as – bluntly – they were the most likely to survive in a moving vehicle for several hours. “But what that meant for the smaller units is that they were left with a cohort of patients who were most likely to die,” said Prof Fong. “Those units would experience mortality rates in excess of 70% in some cases. ” In normal times between 15% and 20% of ICU patients die in hospital, according to the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine. Through the pandemic the NHS did continue to operate and, on a national basis, patients who really needed hospital treatment were not turned away. But Prof Charlotte Summers, in her evidence, said staff are still “carrying the scars” of that time. “You cannot see what we’ve seen, hear what we’ve heard, and do what we’ve had to do and be untouched by it,” she said. “You cannot and be human. And we are very much human. ” Health services in all four UK nations started the pandemic with the number of beds in ICU and staffing levels well below average compared to other rich countries. Five years on and there are still almost 130,000 job vacancies in the NHS across the UK. Sickness rates among the 1. 5 million NHS employees in England are running well above pre-pandemic levels, with days lost to stress, anxiety and mental illness rising from 371,000 in May 2019 to 562,000 in May 2024. All this comes as the health service struggles to recover from Covid with waiting lists for surgery and other planned treatments still hovering near record levels. “We coped, but only just,” said Prof Summers and Dr Suntharalingam in their evidence to the inquiry. “We would have failed if the pandemic had doubled for even one more week, or if a higher proportion of the NHS workforce had fallen sick. “It is crucial to understand how very close we came to a catastrophic failure of the healthcare system. ” With the inquiry ongoing none of the agencies are currently commenting.

To help plug these staff shortages in ICU, volunteers were frequently brought in from other parts of the hospital, often with no experience of intensive care medicine or of dealing with that level of trauma and death. “They were being exposed to things which they wouldn’t necessarily be [exposed to] in their normal jobs, people deteriorating and dying in front of them, the emotional distress of that,” said Dr Ganesh Suntharalingam, an ICU doctor and former president of the Intensive Care Society. Another hospital doctor said he felt some junior members of staff were “thrown in at the deep end” with little training and no choice about where they were sent. The inquiry heard that all this “inevitably” had an impact on some of the sickest patients. At no point did the NHS have to impose a formal ‘national triage’, where someone was refused treatment because they could not get a hospital bed. But using that as measure of health system collapse may be too simplistic anyway. Prof Summers said it would be mistake to think of “catastrophic failure” as a switch that goes “from everything being okay to everything not being okay the next second. ” “It is in the dilution of a million and one tiny little things, particularly in intensive care. ” She said when the system becomes so overstretched it feels like “we are failing our patients” and not providing the care “that we would want for our own families”. New research suggests those hospital units under the greatest pressure also saw the highest mortality rates for both Covid and non-Covid cases. Difficult decisions were having to be made about which of the sickest patients to move up to intensive care. Those Covid patients who needed CPAP, a form of pressurised oxygen support, rather than a ventilator, often had to be cared for in general wards instead, where staff may have been less used to the technology. One anonymous ICU doctor in Wales said: “We didn’t have enough space to ‘give people a go’ who had a very remote chance of getting better. If we had had more capacity, we might have been in a position to try. ” The inquiry was also told that at least one NHS trust was under so much pressure it implemented a blanket “do-not-resuscitate order” at the height of the pandemic. If a patient went into cardiac arrest or stopped breathing, it would mean they should not be given chest compressions or defibrillation to try to save their life. In normal times, that difficult decision should only be made after an individual clinical assessment, and a discussion with the patient or their family. But Prof Jonathan Wyllie, ex-president of the Resuscitation Council, said he knew of one unnamed trust that put in place a blanket order based instead on age, condition and disability. Groups representing bereaved families said they were horrified, adding it was “irrefutable evidence the NHS was overwhelmed”. At times, the impact on intensive care was so great that some units had to undergo “rapid depressurisation” with dozens of patients transferred out, sometimes over long distances, to other hospitals. Before the pandemic, from December 2019 to February 2020, only 68 of these capacity transfers had taken place in England. Between December 2020 and February 2021, 2,152 were needed, either by road or air ambulance. Often it was the most stable patients in smaller district hospitals who would be selected for transfer as – bluntly – they were the most likely to survive in a moving vehicle for several hours. “But what that meant for the smaller units is that they were left with a cohort of patients who were most likely to die,” said Prof Fong. “Those units would experience mortality rates in excess of 70% in some cases. ” In normal times between 15% and 20% of ICU patients die in hospital, according to the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine. Through the pandemic the NHS did continue to operate and, on a national basis, patients who really needed hospital treatment were not turned away. But Prof Charlotte Summers, in her evidence, said staff are still “carrying the scars” of that time. “You cannot see what we’ve seen, hear what we’ve heard, and do what we’ve had to do and be untouched by it,” she said. “You cannot and be human. And we are very much human. ” Health services in all four UK nations started the pandemic with the number of beds in ICU and staffing levels well below average compared to other rich countries. Five years on and there are still almost 130,000 job vacancies in the NHS across the UK. Sickness rates among the 1. 5 million NHS employees in England are running well above pre-pandemic levels, with days lost to stress, anxiety and mental illness rising from 371,000 in May 2019 to 562,000 in May 2024. All this comes as the health service struggles to recover from Covid with waiting lists for surgery and other planned treatments still hovering near record levels. “We coped, but only just,” said Prof Summers and Dr Suntharalingam in their evidence to the inquiry. “We would have failed if the pandemic had doubled for even one more week, or if a higher proportion of the NHS workforce had fallen sick. “It is crucial to understand how very close we came to a catastrophic failure of the healthcare system. ” With the inquiry ongoing none of the agencies are currently commenting.

    "body": "2024/10/23 - Experts revealed that There is nothing in life that is free of risk. That includes vaccines. But the evidence is compelling that the benefits of getting immunised with those vaccines recommended in the UK far outweigh the possibility of serious side effects. The level of benefit from Covid vaccines is well documented. And the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is credited with saving more lives in the first year of its use than any other - 6. 3m globally compared to 5. 9m for Pfizer/BioNTech’s jab. However, we need to discuss not just the huge positives that Covid vaccines brought, but also the small minority left injured or bereaved by the AstraZeneca vaccine. Around 50 families affected by rare blood clots have begun a group legal action for compensation under the Consumer Protection Act, arguing that the vaccine was not as safe as the public were entitled to expect. This includes people who have been left with severe physical injuries, those who are unable to work, and bereaved families who lost a loved one due to vaccine damage. They are a tiny fraction of all those vaccinated, but that is no comfort to the families affected, who feel like they have been airbrushed out of the pandemic and that their pleas for support have been ignored. Those families include Jane and Ian Wrigley from Buckinghamshire. Jane, 62, used to run, ski and climb mountains. Now she can barely walk due to extreme weakness down her left-hand side. Two weeks after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine in March 2021, Jane was admitted to hospital. She suffered blood clots in her brain and required emergency surgery to remove part of her skull. Jane’s medical records clearly state that she suffered these blood clots as a direct side effect of the vaccine. Her husband Ian is now her full-time carer. Jane told me: “Before I had the vaccine I was a very independent, active woman doing half marathons and enjoying my life. Now I’ve lost every bit of independence. ” Her case, and those of others affected by blood clots, raises serious questions about whether the system is letting down those who have suffered serious harm as a result of taking Covid vaccines. Almost 25m adults in the UK received a first dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine in 2021, and nearly all those had a second. It is estimated that the Covid vaccine programme prevented over a quarter of a million hospital admissions and over 120,000 deaths in the UK up to September 2021. The side effects of vaccination are usually mild and short-lived such as a sore arm, fever and fatigue. However, in the very rare event that something goes seriously wrong, we have a right to expect that we will be supported. This is a kind of social contract between individual and state. That’s where the Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme (VDPS) comes in. The VDPS was established in 1979 in the wake of a scare over the safety of the whooping cough vaccine in use at the time. The government-backed scheme offers a one-off financial payment of £120,000 in the event that, on the balance of probability, a vaccine has caused at least 60% disablement. Between the late 1970s and 2020 there were just below 6,500 claims under the scheme for all vaccines and 944 awards. Covid vaccine: Fighting for a payout The Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine is credited with saving millions of lives but it was also responsible, in rare cases, for serious side-effects - blood clots in the brain - which could be fatal. This is the story of those fighting for compensation. Watch on iPlayer But something dramatic has happened since the pandemic. There have been more than double the number of claims under the VDPS for Covid jabs than during the previous four decades for all other vaccines combined. Since the pandemic there have been almost 16,000 claims against Covid vaccines and 180 awards. Just over half of all claimants have yet to find out if they have been successful. So what is happening? Of the awards, all but a handful are for damage done by the AstraZeneca Covid vaccine, which is no longer used. There is a long list of different health conditions that qualify for a payment but the AstraZeneca jab had one specific rare side effect not seen in the mRNA vaccines produced by Pfizer and Moderna, which are now the mainstay of all Covid booster campaigns. The side effect is a type of blood clot, often in the brain, combined with low platelet levels, almost always within a few weeks after receiving the first dose. This can cause damage in the brain and to multiple other organs. Platelets are cells that help your blood clot, and it was so unusual to see blood clots combined with low platelet levels, that experts coined a new medical term: vaccine-induced thrombosis with thrombocytopenia, or VITT. These were so unusual that the signal was not seen in the clinical trials of the vaccine involving more than 23,000 participants, but only once the jab had started being rolled out across Europe and given to millions. In mid-March 2021, a dozen European countries briefly suspended use of the AstraZeneca jab while the clots link was investigated. Then, in April that year, the UK restricted the vaccine to the over-30s, and a month later to the over-40s because it became clear that younger people were at higher risk from the clots. Several other European countries, when they resumed using the AstraZeneca vaccine, set the age limit much higher: France to those aged over 55; Germany, Italy and the Irish Republic to the over-60s. Denmark halted its use altogether. In early April 2021, safety regulators in the UK and Europe had concluded that blood clots combined with low platelets should be listed as a rare side effect. The rare syndrome was also reported among recipients of the J&amp;J Janssen Covid jab, which uses the same type of vaccine technology, in the United States. Sarah Moore, a solicitor with the law firm Leigh Day, says the families she represents have been driven to sue AstraZeneca because of the inadequacies of the VDPS. “The scheme offers too little, too late, to too few people,” she says. She describes the £120,000 payment as “woefully inadequate”, pointing out that the figure had not increased since 2007. Had the sum kept pace with inflation, it would now stand at £197,000. Ms Moore says some of her clients need 24-hour care, cannot wash or dress themselves, have been left with severe physical or cognitive deficits and will never work again. The case of Jane and Ian Wrigley also illustrates another criticism of the VDPS: delay. The couple waited over two years for a payment under the scheme, despite the clear-cut nature of the case. Assessments under the VDPS are done on paper and do not involve physical examination. Last year, the government announced that it had modernised the operations of the VDPS to allow cases to be processed more quickly and increased the number of staff dealing with claims from four to 80. But a huge backlog of claims has built up. Peter Schulze, 49, is another member of the group action against AstraZeneca. He too suffered VITT blood clots after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine in April 2021 and now needs 24-hour care. His submission to the VDPS was completed in July 2022, yet he is still awaiting a decision, despite VITT blood clots being clearly mentioned in his medical records. Finally there is the 60% disablement threshold for successful claims, which has ruled out hundreds of people who are officially recognised as having been damaged by Covid vaccines. Ms Moore says she had a female client who was now blind in one eye, with other physical and psychological injuries, but was told she didn’t reach the 60% threshold. She says under normal civil claim rules, blindness in one eye could lead to compensation of more than £200,000. It was “absolutely heartbreaking”, she added, for people to be told that the vaccine has caused their injuries yet be informed they are not disabled enough to qualify for a payment. During the pandemic, the government granted vaccine manufacturers legal indemnity.  This did not prevent people from making a claim for compensation against pharmaceutical firms, but determined who would pay in the event of a successful action. Then-Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the Commons: “We are providing indemnities in the very unexpected event of any adverse reactions that could not have been foreseen through the robust checks and procedures that have been put in place. ” Ms Moore says she has not seen a copy of this legal undertaking but believes it means that the government will pick up AstraZeneca’s legal costs and would be responsible for paying compensation in the event of a successful claim. AstraZeneca made no profit from its Covid vaccine, Vaxrevia, but its total revenue in 2023 was $45. 8bn (£35. 1bn) with profits of $5. 9bn. In May AstraZeneca withdrew Vaxrevia citing a “surplus of available updated vaccines”. The UK government did not buy any doses for its booster programmes and all Covid vaccines used in the UK for this autumn’s booster campaign are either Pfizer or Moderna, both of which use mRNA technology. Prof Adam Finn is one of the UK’s leading experts on vaccines, and throughout the pandemic was a member of the JCVI, the body which advises the government on immunisation. He was involved in key decisions on recommending the order in which the public received Covid vaccines and the age restrictions put on the AstraZeneca jab when the clots risks emerged. Prof Finn, who is professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol, says Covid vaccines were a massive success and “really saved a lot of people’s lives”. He is not involved in the legal action and believes the decisions taken in the UK around the vaccines’ use were correct. But he says the VDPS is “clearly not working as it should” and that payments should be index-linked so that they reflect changes in the cost of living. He also criticises the “very arbitrary” 60% threshold for payouts. Prof Finn adds that it’s necessary “to take a really good look” at compensation for all current and future vaccines. I point out to Prof Finn that there was a danger in a report like this that it could undermine confidence in vaccines. He rejects this: “The only way to retain trust is to be honest. ” But he does think the inadequacies of the VDPS risk undermining that public confidence in vaccines. While only a small proportion of people have been affected, he says, “they’ve been very seriously harmed and that is going to attract public attention. It’s going to be reported, and people are going to reflect on that, and people will want to see those people treated fairly”. In a statement, AstraZeneca said: “We cannot comment on ongoing litigation. Our sympathy goes out to anyone who has lost loved ones or reported health problems. Patient safety is our highest priority. ” The statement added that AstraZeneca’s vaccine “has continuously been shown to have an acceptable safety profile and regulators around the world consistently state that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks of extremely rare potential side effects”. The health secretary Wes Streeting recently met with people who have been injured or bereaved as a result of vaccine damage. In a statement the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said the meeting was to “listen to their concerns” and said “the government will look closely at these as we continue to learn and apply the lessons of the pandemic”. The statement added: “Our deepest sympathies are with those who have suffered harm. ” The DHSC said the administrator of the VDPS had made operational changes to the scheme in an effort to reduce the time claimants wait for an outcome. The workings of the VDPS will be considered in the next module of the Covid inquiry, which will begin taking evidence in January 2025. Ms Moore, who expects to give evidence to the inquiry, says her clients are not “anti-vax”. She says: “We are acting for people who stood up and got vaccinated. By definition they’re all pro-vaccination. This is an act to support vaccine confidence. ” As for the legal action against AstraZeneca, that could drag on for years.

Covid vaccine: Fighting for a payout The Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine is credited with saving millions of lives but it was also responsible, in rare cases, for serious side-effects - blood clots in the brain - which could be fatal. This is the story of those fighting for compensation. Watch on iPlayer But something dramatic has happened since the pandemic. There have been more than double the number of claims under the VDPS for Covid jabs than during the previous four decades for all other vaccines combined. Since the pandemic there have been almost 16,000 claims against Covid vaccines and 180 awards. Just over half of all claimants have yet to find out if they have been successful. So what is happening? Of the awards, all but a handful are for damage done by the AstraZeneca Covid vaccine, which is no longer used. There is a long list of different health conditions that qualify for a payment but the AstraZeneca jab had one specific rare side effect not seen in the mRNA vaccines produced by Pfizer and Moderna, which are now the mainstay of all Covid booster campaigns. The side effect is a type of blood clot, often in the brain, combined with low platelet levels, almost always within a few weeks after receiving the first dose. This can cause damage in the brain and to multiple other organs. Platelets are cells that help your blood clot, and it was so unusual to see blood clots combined with low platelet levels, that experts coined a new medical term: vaccine-induced thrombosis with thrombocytopenia, or VITT. These were so unusual that the signal was not seen in the clinical trials of the vaccine involving more than 23,000 participants, but only once the jab had started being rolled out across Europe and given to millions. In mid-March 2021, a dozen European countries briefly suspended use of the AstraZeneca jab while the clots link was investigated. Then, in April that year, the UK restricted the vaccine to the over-30s, and a month later to the over-40s because it became clear that younger people were at higher risk from the clots. Several other European countries, when they resumed using the AstraZeneca vaccine, set the age limit much higher: France to those aged over 55; Germany, Italy and the Irish Republic to the over-60s. Denmark halted its use altogether. In early April 2021, safety regulators in the UK and Europe had concluded that blood clots combined with low platelets should be listed as a rare side effect. The rare syndrome was also reported among recipients of the J&amp;J Janssen Covid jab, which uses the same type of vaccine technology, in the United States. Sarah Moore, a solicitor with the law firm Leigh Day, says the families she represents have been driven to sue AstraZeneca because of the inadequacies of the VDPS. “The scheme offers too little, too late, to too few people,” she says. She describes the £120,000 payment as “woefully inadequate”, pointing out that the figure had not increased since 2007. Had the sum kept pace with inflation, it would now stand at £197,000. Ms Moore says some of her clients need 24-hour care, cannot wash or dress themselves, have been left with severe physical or cognitive deficits and will never work again. The case of Jane and Ian Wrigley also illustrates another criticism of the VDPS: delay. The couple waited over two years for a payment under the scheme, despite the clear-cut nature of the case. Assessments under the VDPS are done on paper and do not involve physical examination. Last year, the government announced that it had modernised the operations of the VDPS to allow cases to be processed more quickly and increased the number of staff dealing with claims from four to 80. But a huge backlog of claims has built up. Peter Schulze, 49, is another member of the group action against AstraZeneca. He too suffered VITT blood clots after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine in April 2021 and now needs 24-hour care. His submission to the VDPS was completed in July 2022, yet he is still awaiting a decision, despite VITT blood clots being clearly mentioned in his medical records. Finally there is the 60% disablement threshold for successful claims, which has ruled out hundreds of people who are officially recognised as having been damaged by Covid vaccines. Ms Moore says she had a female client who was now blind in one eye, with other physical and psychological injuries, but was told she didn’t reach the 60% threshold. She says under normal civil claim rules, blindness in one eye could lead to compensation of more than £200,000. It was “absolutely heartbreaking”, she added, for people to be told that the vaccine has caused their injuries yet be informed they are not disabled enough to qualify for a payment. During the pandemic, the government granted vaccine manufacturers legal indemnity.  This did not prevent people from making a claim for compensation against pharmaceutical firms, but determined who would pay in the event of a successful action. Then-Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the Commons: “We are providing indemnities in the very unexpected event of any adverse reactions that could not have been foreseen through the robust checks and procedures that have been put in place. ” Ms Moore says she has not seen a copy of this legal undertaking but believes it means that the government will pick up AstraZeneca’s legal costs and would be responsible for paying compensation in the event of a successful claim. AstraZeneca made no profit from its Covid vaccine, Vaxrevia, but its total revenue in 2023 was $45. 8bn (£35. 1bn) with profits of $5. 9bn. In May AstraZeneca withdrew Vaxrevia citing a “surplus of available updated vaccines”. The UK government did not buy any doses for its booster programmes and all Covid vaccines used in the UK for this autumn’s booster campaign are either Pfizer or Moderna, both of which use mRNA technology. Prof Adam Finn is one of the UK’s leading experts on vaccines, and throughout the pandemic was a member of the JCVI, the body which advises the government on immunisation. He was involved in key decisions on recommending the order in which the public received Covid vaccines and the age restrictions put on the AstraZeneca jab when the clots risks emerged. Prof Finn, who is professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol, says Covid vaccines were a massive success and “really saved a lot of people’s lives”. He is not involved in the legal action and believes the decisions taken in the UK around the vaccines’ use were correct. But he says the VDPS is “clearly not working as it should” and that payments should be index-linked so that they reflect changes in the cost of living. He also criticises the “very arbitrary” 60% threshold for payouts. Prof Finn adds that it’s necessary “to take a really good look” at compensation for all current and future vaccines. I point out to Prof Finn that there was a danger in a report like this that it could undermine confidence in vaccines. He rejects this: “The only way to retain trust is to be honest. ” But he does think the inadequacies of the VDPS risk undermining that public confidence in vaccines. While only a small proportion of people have been affected, he says, “they’ve been very seriously harmed and that is going to attract public attention. It’s going to be reported, and people are going to reflect on that, and people will want to see those people treated fairly”. In a statement, AstraZeneca said: “We cannot comment on ongoing litigation. Our sympathy goes out to anyone who has lost loved ones or reported health problems. Patient safety is our highest priority. ” The statement added that AstraZeneca’s vaccine “has continuously been shown to have an acceptable safety profile and regulators around the world consistently state that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks of extremely rare potential side effects”. The health secretary Wes Streeting recently met with people who have been injured or bereaved as a result of vaccine damage. In a statement the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said the meeting was to “listen to their concerns” and said “the government will look closely at these as we continue to learn and apply the lessons of the pandemic”. The statement added: “Our deepest sympathies are with those who have suffered harm. ” The DHSC said the administrator of the VDPS had made operational changes to the scheme in an effort to reduce the time claimants wait for an outcome. The workings of the VDPS will be considered in the next module of the Covid inquiry, which will begin taking evidence in January 2025. Ms Moore, who expects to give evidence to the inquiry, says her clients are not “anti-vax”. She says: “We are acting for people who stood up and got vaccinated. By definition they’re all pro-vaccination. This is an act to support vaccine confidence. ” As for the legal action against AstraZeneca, that could drag on for years.

    "title": "Update: How will weight-loss drugs change our relationship with food?",
    "body": "2024/10/19 - According to new developments, We are now in the era of weight-loss drugs. Decisions on how these drugs will be used look likely to shape our future health and even what our society might look like. And, as researchers are finding, they are already toppling the belief that obesity is simply a moral failing of the weak-willed. Weight-loss drugs are already at the heart of the national debate. This week, the new Labour government suggested they could be a tool to help obese people in England off benefits and back into work. That announcement - and the reaction to it - has held a mirror up to our own personal opinions around obesity and what should be done to tackle it. Here are some questions I’d like you to ponder. Is obesity something that people bring on themselves and they just need to make better life choices? Or is it a societal failing with millions of victims that needs stronger laws to control the types of food we eat? Are effective weight-loss drugs the sensible choice in an obesity crisis? Are they being used as a convenient excuse to duck the big issue of why so many people are overweight in the first place? Personal choice v nanny state; realism v idealism – there are few medical conditions that stir up such heated debate. I can’t resolve all those questions for you - it all depends on your personal views about obesity and the type of country you want to live in. But as you think them over, there are some further things to consider. Obesity is very visible, unlike conditions such as high blood pressure, and has long come with a stigma of blame and shame. Gluttony is one of Christianity’s seven deadly sins. Now, let’s look at Semaglutide, which is sold under the brand name Wegovy for weight loss. It mimics a hormone that is released when we eat and tricks the brain into thinking we are full, dialling down our appetite so that we eat less. What this means is that by changing only one hormone, “suddenly you change your entire relationship with food”, says Prof Giles Yeo, an obesity scientist at the University of Cambridge. And that has all sorts of implications for the way we think about obesity. It also means for a lot of overweight people there is a “hormonal deficiency, or at least it doesn’t go up as high”, argues Prof Yeo, which leaves them biologically more hungry and primed to put on weight than someone who is naturally thin. That was likely an advantage 100 or more years ago when food was less plentiful – driving people to consume calories when they are available, because tomorrow there may be none. Our genes have not profoundly changed in a century, but the world we live in has made it easier to pile on the pounds with the rise of cheap and calorie-dense foods, ballooning portion sizes and towns and cities that make it easier to drive than walk or cycle. These changes took off in the second half of the 20th Century, giving rise to what scientists call the “obesogenic environment” - that is, one that encourages people to eat unhealthily and not do enough exercise. Now one in four adults in the UK is obese. Wegovy can help people lose around 15% of their starting body weight before the benefits plateau. Despite constantly being labelled a “skinny drug” this could take someone weighing 20 stone down to 17 stone. Medically, that would improve health in areas like heart attack risk, sleep apnoea and type 2 diabetes. But Dr Margaret McCartney, a GP in Glasgow, cautions: “If we keep putting people into an obesogenic environment, we’re just going to increase need for these drugs forever. ” At the moment the NHS is planning to prescribe the drugs only for two years because of the cost. Evidence shows that when the injections stop, the appetite comes back and the weight goes back on. “My big concern is the eye is taken off the ball with stopping people getting overweight in the first place,” says Dr McCartney. We know the obesogenic environment starts early. One in five children is already overweight or obese by the time they start school. And we know that it hits poorer communities (in which 36% of adults in England are obese) harder than wealthier ones (where the figure is 20%), in part due to the lack of availability of cheap, healthy food in those less affluent districts. But there is often a tension between improving public health and civil liberties. You can drive, but you have to wear a seatbelt; you can smoke, but with very high taxes alongside restrictions on age and where you can do it. So here are some further things for you to consider. Do you think we should also tackle the obesogenic environment or just treat people when it’s starting to damage their health? Should government be far tougher on the food industry, transforming what we can buy and eat? Should we be encouraged to go Japanese (a rich country with low obesity) and have smaller meals based around rice, vegetables and fish? Or should we cap the calories in ready meals and chocolate bars? What about sugar or junk-food taxes? What about wider bans on where calorie-dense foods can be sold or advertised? Prof Yeo says if we want change then “we’re going to have to compromise somewhere, we’re going to have to lose some liberties” but “I don’t think we’ve come to a decision within society, I don’t think we’ve debated it”. In England, there have been official obesity strategies – 14 of them across three decades and with very little to show for it. They included five-a-day campaigns to promote eating fruit and veg, food labelling to highlight calorie content, restrictions on advertising unhealthy food to children and voluntary agreements with manufacturers to reformulate foods. But although there are tentative signs that child obesity in England may be starting to fall, none of these measures have sufficiently altered the national diet to turn the tide on obesity overall. There is one school of thought that weight-loss drugs may even be the event that triggers the change in our meals. “Food companies profit, that’s what they want - the only ray of hope I have is if weight-loss drugs help a lot of people resist buying fast foods, can that start the partial reversal of the food environment?” asks Prof Naveed Sattar from the University of Glasgow. As weight-loss drugs become far more available, deciding how they will be used and how that fits into our wider approach to obesity will need to be addressed soon. At the moment we are only dipping our toes in the water. There is limited supply of these drugs and because of their huge expense, they are available on the NHS to relatively few people and for a short time. That is expected to change dramatically over the next decade. New drugs, such as tirzepatide, are on the way and the pharmaceutical companies will lose their legal protections – patents – meaning other companies can make their own, cheaper versions. In the early days of blood-pressure-lowering medicines or statins to reduce cholesterol, they were expensive and given to the few who would benefit the most. Now around eight million people in the UK are taking each of those drugs. Prof Stephen O’Rahilly, director of the MRC Metabolic Diseases Unit, says blood pressure was tacked with using a combination of drugs and societal change: “We screened for blood pressure, we advised about lower sodium [salt] in foods and we developed cheap, safe and effective blood pressure drugs. ” That’s analogous, he says, to what needs to happen with obesity. It is still not clear how many of us will end up on weight-loss medication. Will it only be for those who are very obese and at medical risk? Or will it become preventative to stop people becoming obese? How long should people take weight-loss drugs for? Should it be for life? How widely should they be used in children? Does it matter if people using the drugs are still eating unhealthy junk food, just less of it? How quickly should weight-loss medications be adopted when we still do not know the side-effects of long term use? Are we OK with healthy people taking them entirely for cosmetic reasons? Could their availability privately widen the obesity and health gap between rich and poor? So many questions - but, as yet, few clear answers. “I don’t know where this is going to land - we’re on a voyage of uncertainty,” says Prof Naveed Sattar.

    "title": "Big News: How will weight-loss drugs change our relationship with food?",
    "body": "2024/10/19 - It has been recently reported that We are now in the era of weight-loss drugs. Decisions on how these drugs will be used look likely to shape our future health and even what our society might look like. And, as researchers are finding, they are already toppling the belief that obesity is simply a moral failing of the weak-willed. Weight-loss drugs are already at the heart of the national debate. This week, the new Labour government suggested they could be a tool to help obese people in England off benefits and back into work. That announcement - and the reaction to it - has held a mirror up to our own personal opinions around obesity and what should be done to tackle it. Here are some questions I’d like you to ponder. Is obesity something that people bring on themselves and they just need to make better life choices? Or is it a societal failing with millions of victims that needs stronger laws to control the types of food we eat? Are effective weight-loss drugs the sensible choice in an obesity crisis? Are they being used as a convenient excuse to duck the big issue of why so many people are overweight in the first place? Personal choice v nanny state; realism v idealism – there are few medical conditions that stir up such heated debate. I can’t resolve all those questions for you - it all depends on your personal views about obesity and the type of country you want to live in. But as you think them over, there are some further things to consider. Obesity is very visible, unlike conditions such as high blood pressure, and has long come with a stigma of blame and shame. Gluttony is one of Christianity’s seven deadly sins. Now, let’s look at Semaglutide, which is sold under the brand name Wegovy for weight loss. It mimics a hormone that is released when we eat and tricks the brain into thinking we are full, dialling down our appetite so that we eat less. What this means is that by changing only one hormone, “suddenly you change your entire relationship with food”, says Prof Giles Yeo, an obesity scientist at the University of Cambridge. And that has all sorts of implications for the way we think about obesity. It also means for a lot of overweight people there is a “hormonal deficiency, or at least it doesn’t go up as high”, argues Prof Yeo, which leaves them biologically more hungry and primed to put on weight than someone who is naturally thin. That was likely an advantage 100 or more years ago when food was less plentiful – driving people to consume calories when they are available, because tomorrow there may be none. Our genes have not profoundly changed in a century, but the world we live in has made it easier to pile on the pounds with the rise of cheap and calorie-dense foods, ballooning portion sizes and towns and cities that make it easier to drive than walk or cycle. These changes took off in the second half of the 20th Century, giving rise to what scientists call the “obesogenic environment” - that is, one that encourages people to eat unhealthily and not do enough exercise. Now one in four adults in the UK is obese. Wegovy can help people lose around 15% of their starting body weight before the benefits plateau. Despite constantly being labelled a “skinny drug” this could take someone weighing 20 stone down to 17 stone. Medically, that would improve health in areas like heart attack risk, sleep apnoea and type 2 diabetes. But Dr Margaret McCartney, a GP in Glasgow, cautions: “If we keep putting people into an obesogenic environment, we’re just going to increase need for these drugs forever. ” At the moment the NHS is planning to prescribe the drugs only for two years because of the cost. Evidence shows that when the injections stop, the appetite comes back and the weight goes back on. “My big concern is the eye is taken off the ball with stopping people getting overweight in the first place,” says Dr McCartney. We know the obesogenic environment starts early. One in five children is already overweight or obese by the time they start school. And we know that it hits poorer communities (in which 36% of adults in England are obese) harder than wealthier ones (where the figure is 20%), in part due to the lack of availability of cheap, healthy food in those less affluent districts. But there is often a tension between improving public health and civil liberties. You can drive, but you have to wear a seatbelt; you can smoke, but with very high taxes alongside restrictions on age and where you can do it. So here are some further things for you to consider. Do you think we should also tackle the obesogenic environment or just treat people when it’s starting to damage their health? Should government be far tougher on the food industry, transforming what we can buy and eat? Should we be encouraged to go Japanese (a rich country with low obesity) and have smaller meals based around rice, vegetables and fish? Or should we cap the calories in ready meals and chocolate bars? What about sugar or junk-food taxes? What about wider bans on where calorie-dense foods can be sold or advertised? Prof Yeo says if we want change then “we’re going to have to compromise somewhere, we’re going to have to lose some liberties” but “I don’t think we’ve come to a decision within society, I don’t think we’ve debated it”. In England, there have been official obesity strategies – 14 of them across three decades and with very little to show for it. They included five-a-day campaigns to promote eating fruit and veg, food labelling to highlight calorie content, restrictions on advertising unhealthy food to children and voluntary agreements with manufacturers to reformulate foods. But although there are tentative signs that child obesity in England may be starting to fall, none of these measures have sufficiently altered the national diet to turn the tide on obesity overall. There is one school of thought that weight-loss drugs may even be the event that triggers the change in our meals. “Food companies profit, that’s what they want - the only ray of hope I have is if weight-loss drugs help a lot of people resist buying fast foods, can that start the partial reversal of the food environment?” asks Prof Naveed Sattar from the University of Glasgow. As weight-loss drugs become far more available, deciding how they will be used and how that fits into our wider approach to obesity will need to be addressed soon. At the moment we are only dipping our toes in the water. There is limited supply of these drugs and because of their huge expense, they are available on the NHS to relatively few people and for a short time. That is expected to change dramatically over the next decade. New drugs, such as tirzepatide, are on the way and the pharmaceutical companies will lose their legal protections – patents – meaning other companies can make their own, cheaper versions. In the early days of blood-pressure-lowering medicines or statins to reduce cholesterol, they were expensive and given to the few who would benefit the most. Now around eight million people in the UK are taking each of those drugs. Prof Stephen O’Rahilly, director of the MRC Metabolic Diseases Unit, says blood pressure was tacked with using a combination of drugs and societal change: “We screened for blood pressure, we advised about lower sodium [salt] in foods and we developed cheap, safe and effective blood pressure drugs. ” That’s analogous, he says, to what needs to happen with obesity. It is still not clear how many of us will end up on weight-loss medication. Will it only be for those who are very obese and at medical risk? Or will it become preventative to stop people becoming obese? How long should people take weight-loss drugs for? Should it be for life? How widely should they be used in children? Does it matter if people using the drugs are still eating unhealthy junk food, just less of it? How quickly should weight-loss medications be adopted when we still do not know the side-effects of long term use? Are we OK with healthy people taking them entirely for cosmetic reasons? Could their availability privately widen the obesity and health gap between rich and poor? So many questions - but, as yet, few clear answers. “I don’t know where this is going to land - we’re on a voyage of uncertainty,” says Prof Naveed Sattar.

    "title": "New: NHS needs better plan around weight loss jabs, warn experts",
    "body": "2024/10/16 - According to new developments, An urgent review is needed to make sure people in England can get weight loss jabs such as Wegovy and Mounjaro on the NHS, top experts warn. It comes a day after the prime minister said such injections could boost Britain’s economy by getting obese unemployed people “back into work”. More than 200 doctors and specialists have now written to the health secretary to say how stretched NHS obesity treatment services face unprecedented demand from patients wanting these drugs. They warn the injections are only part of what should be a wider package of non-stigmatising care. They say the government must fix some fundamentals issues in NHS obesity services - chronic underfunding, workforce challenges and unequal access to care. The letter to Wes Streeting is being sent by the Obesity Health Alliance (OHA), which represents health charities and medical royal colleges, and has compiled a report. It says some patients can wait up to five years for specialist support, and that some services are so overstretched they have closed their waiting lists entirely. The OHA wants to see equitable access for obesity treatments, including weight loss injections. There have been reports of global stock shortages and, currently in the UK on the NHS, the injections can only be offered through specialist weight-management services. Some patients go private, but many others miss out, warns the OHA. According to the OHA, about four million people in England are eligible for Wegovy, but NHS projections estimate that by 2028, fewer than 50,000 people a year would get the treatment. Katharine Jenner, director of the OHA, said the weight loss jabs were effective, but that was not the whole picture. “Even if you are taking the jabs you still need to have extra care and support around it. You still need to be doing exercise and have dietary advice as well and that’s not currently there. “There is also concern about who is getting access to this drug. We need to make sure that we are prioritising access based on greatest clinical need and not based on any other factors. ” She added that the OHA had heard about people that had a right to access treatment services due to their excess weight being turned away. “They’re having to seek private treatment and they’re not getting the care and support package that they’d be expecting to get if you had any other sort of condition,” she said. “We need to have a review of existing NHS services to identify cases of really good best practice and identify those challenges that exist all over the place. ” The upcoming approval for the NHS to use another injection, called Mounjaro, dubbed by some as the King Kong of weight loss jabs for how well it appears works in trials, is expected to place even more pressure on the system, the report warns. Alfie Slade, government affairs lead at the OHA, said: “The new weight loss drugs represent a breakthrough in treatment, giving hope to the millions of people struggling to manage their weight, but they also expose the weaknesses in our current obesity services. “Without urgent government intervention, we will fail to meet the needs of millions of patients, leading to greater health inequalities. ” Despite the benefits, health experts also caution that Wegovy and Mounjaro, which mimic a hormone that makes people less hungry, are not a quick fix. Patients must still exercise and watch what they eat. Users can put weight back on once they stop the medication. And, as with any drug, there can be side effects. Doctors are concerned about the growing numbers of patients they are seeing with complications from taking weight loss drugs bought online without clinical supervision. In many cases people might not actually be getting what they think they are, which can be very dangerous. Public health measures to help prevent obesity problems in the first place, such as improving the nation’s diet and helping children get enough exercise, are also vital, says the OHA. NHS England said it was working with the government and industry to develop new kinds of services which mean approved treatments can be rolled out safely, effectively and affordably. A spokesperson said weight loss drugs would be “transformative” and, alongside NHS early prevention initiatives, “help more people to lose weight and reduce their risk of killer conditions like diabetes, heart attack and stroke”. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said obesity “costs the NHS more than £11bn a year and it also places a significant burden on our economy”. “With obesity-related illness causing people to take more days off sick, obesity drugs can be part of the solution,” they said. The spokesperson also said junk-food advertising restrictions and a ban on the sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to children would help tackle the “obesity crisis”. "

    "title": "New: Covid inquiry told of trust do-not-resuscitate rule",
    "body": "2024/10/10 - Experts revealed that At least one NHS trust put in place a blanket “do-not-resuscitate” order for sick patients in the pandemic, the Covid inquiry has heard. It would mean individuals were considered ineligible for potentially lifesaving CPR, solely on the basis of age or disability, without being individually assessed. Former Resuscitation Council UK president Prof Jonathan Wyllie said he knew of one trust implementing the policy, although he had not seen a document setting it out. Groups representing the families of people who died from Covid said they were “horrified but not surprised”. Under NHS guidance, a Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (DNCPR) order can be added to someone’s medical notes after consultation with the patient or their family members. It means medical staff will not attempt chest compressions or defibrillation, where an electric shock is applied to restore normal heart rhythm, if the patient’s heart or breathing stops. Only 15-20% of those who have CPR in hospital survive, with success rates dropping to 5-10% outside of a hospital setting. Groups representing bereaved families believe some hospital departments became so overwhelmed in the pandemic that blanket DNACPR rules were applied, based solely on age, disability or medical condition. At the time, the charity Mencap said some people with learning disabilities had reported being told they would not be resuscitated if taken ill with Covid. NHS England says a blanket DNACPR rule for every person with a specific medical condition or over a certain age would be unlawful. It wrote to NHS trusts a number of times during the pandemic, to remind clinicians the orders should only ever be applied with the “appropriate consent”. Prof Wyllie told the inquiry he had not seen a document from the NHS trust concerned but had heard about the policy from a fellow member of the Resuscitation Council. The charity, which develops guidelines and training for medical staff, had then released a “very clear” public statement that blanket DNACPR orders were “not an appropriate way forward and should not be implemented”. “That was our stance and that has never changed,” Prof Wyllie added. Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK said the use of blanket policies would be “irrefutable evidence” some NHS services had been overwhelmed in the pandemic. “The inquiry has heard repeatedly from those at the top that blanket DNACPRs were not appropriate and that there was no directive in place,” the group’s solicitor Nicola Brook said. “The bereaved families have known for a long time that the realities on the ground were very different. “Their worst fears have now been confirmed but this brings with it more questions, ‘If it happened at this trust, did it happen at the trust where my loved one was?’” "

    "title": "Update: We were not treated as parents, Covid inquiry told",
    "body": "2024/10/07 - It has been recently reported that A mother of premature twins has told the Covid inquiry she did not feel like she was treated as a parent after giving birth in the early stages of the pandemic. Tamsin Mullen said she was kept in a side room for 27 hours after giving birth by caesarean section while her sons were taken to neonatal intensive care. She said “rigid” visiting restrictions meant that, for the next month, only one parent was allowed to visit her newborn babies at a time. “We needed the hospital to understand we were a family,” she told the inquiry. “We didn’t feel like a mother and father to our children in the way we should have done. ” The Covid inquiry has been taking evidence about the impact on maternity services as part of its third section, or module, which is investigating the impact on the NHS and healthcare. Ms Mullen, a mother of three, was giving first-hand “impact” evidence on behalf of 13 pregnancy, baby and parent organisations. She found out she was expecting twin boys in 2019 and was considered high-risk. When pregnant with her first child, she was diagnosed with preeclampsia - a condition which can cause high blood pressure and lead to serious complications. Her pregnancy was being monitored closely with scans every week because of concerns about the development of one of the babies. Initially she said her husband was able to come with her to scanning appointments, but as Covid spread in March 2020, he was forced to wait in the car park outside after driving 50 miles from their home to the nearest hospital. “It was just before the first lockdown came into effect,” she said. “I was very nervous. It was very difficult to do that alone knowing [the pregnancy] was high-risk. ” In April 2020, Ms Mullen’s two sons were born prematurely, at 34 weeks, by caesarean section. Her husband was able to be with her in the operating theatre and then in the recovery room for an hour, before being told Covid restrictions meant he had to leave. Their two young boys then spent a total of 31 days in neonatal intensive care before they could be discharged. Ms Mullen said Covid restrictions meant only one parent could be with them at a time, even after they had been moved to a single room away from other babies. The hospital had shut off access to side rooms used for breastfeeding and Ms Mullen said she was told to use a toilet to express milk, something she did not want to do because of the infection risk. She said the restrictions were “baffling” when both parents lived together and were driving to hospital each morning in the same car. She was looking after both babies by herself in intensive care when hospital staff from outside the unit told her they had tested positive for a bacterial infection called MRSA. “I was holding our son who was on oxygen at the time,” she said. “I was in a state of shock so didn’t really say very much. They [the staff] left me and I was there on my own. “I didn’t know what it all meant, so I really panicked. ” Later a doctor explained the form of MRSA involved was a less serious type that could be treated with soap and water. “We didn’t feel like we were being treated as parents. It was like we were visitors, and we were visiting two patients,” she said. The inquiry later heard from Jenny Ward, the chief executive of the Lullaby Trust, who chairs the pregnancy and baby charities network. She said that, before Covid, most parents would have had 24/7 unrestricted access to their young children in neonatal intensive care. It was not until April 2022 in England and Scotland, and May 2022 in Wales, that the guidance reverted back. She said the decision to suspend visiting from March 2020 for a large number of maternity services had been “hugely damaging”. Restrictions during antenatal scans had a particularly negative impact on some women who had to receive bad news about the health of their baby on their own, she added. For much of the pandemic, pregnant women were often told they were only allowed to have a birthing partner present when in so-called “active” labour. As a result, some were left alone in individual birthing rooms without anyone else to “advocate for them, to say they seem to be in extreme pain”, Ms Ward told the inquiry. After giving birth, others had to recover from surgery in hospital while looking after a newborn baby without their partners able to be present. "

Tamsin Mullen said she was kept in a side room for 27 hours after giving birth by caesarean section while her sons were taken to neonatal intensive care.

    "title": "New: Covid ambulance crews faced 'crucial PPE delays'",
    "body": "2024/10/01 - Let’s dive into the details: Ambulance crews faced crucial delays trying to save dying patients in the pandemic because of the time it took to put on protective equipment, the Covid inquiry has been told. Ambulance technician Mark Tilley appeared close to tears when he described how the experience still “played on his mind”. “I bottle things away. I’m told quite a lot of times I’m cold. I just deal with it in the way that I deal with it,” he said. During the pandemic, some ambulance staff moved into budget hotels for weeks at a time to avoid putting family members in danger, he added. Mr Tilley, who works for South East Coast Ambulance Service, was giving evidence as a representative of the GMB union. In January 2021, at the peak of the winter wave of the pandemic, he volunteered to move to Sittingbourne, in north Kent, for three weeks, along with 40 colleagues. A new variant of Covid which appeared to transmit more quickly had recently emerged in the area, and hospitals were coming under increased pressure. He told the inquiry that, on one occasion, he had to queue in his ambulance outside A&amp;E for an entire ten-hour shift because there was not enough room to transfer a “heavily deteriorating” patient into the building. “We’d run out of oxygen, so we’d had to scan the hospital to try and find [more],” he said. “We ordered pizza to the vehicle because otherwise we wouldn’t have had anything to eat. ” Because of lockdown rules at the time, volunteer ambulance crews were sleeping in a budget hotel, with some deciding not to return home to avoid placing family members in danger. “You had nowhere to go, so it was just the facilities that were there: the television and a phone,” he said. “You had 12 hours [after your shift] to mull over what you’d been seeing; the queues at the hospital, the poor patients. ” In his testimony, Mr Tilley described arriving at residential homes where patients were dying “inside the front window or on the pathway”. Under guidance, paramedics and other ambulance staff were told they had to wait until arriving at the scene before they could put on plastic Tyvek suits and protective hoods or masks. He said that could cost crews a crucial minute and a half before they were able to start treatment: “I would have normally gone over and started bouncing up and down on their chest [to perform CPR]. “But [instead] we went and got our masks and suits on and all of that – that plays on my mind all the time. “For me, you can’t change history no matter what you talk about, it’s history. We can’t change it. ” Counsel to the inquiry Alice Hands said research commissioned by the inquiry had revealed similar accounts, with other ambulance crews saying they were “forced not to intervene… and watch people die” while they put on equipment. In his evidence, Anthony Marsh, national ambulance adviser to NHS England and former chairman of the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives, said he was aware of those concerns at the time and did raise the matter with senior colleagues. But he said allowing crews to put on PPE when they were travelling to the scene to cut the total response time would “not have been safe”. "

    "title": "Latest: Covid was like a daily terror attack, doctor tells inquiry",
    "body": "2024/09/26 - Experts revealed that Treating patients during the pandemic was like responding to a daily terror attack, the Covid inquiry has heard. Giving testimony, Professor Kevin Fong, spoke of staff he met during a hospital visit being in “total bits”. The former national clinical adviser in emergency preparedness at NHS England recalled a conversation with an intensive care doctor during a visit in December 2020. “I asked him immediately what things had been like and… I’ll never forget, he replied it’s been like a terrorist attack every day since it started, and we don’t know when the attacks are going to stop. ” Prof Fong described Covid as the “biggest national emergency this country has faced since World War Two”, and repeatedly broke down in tears on the stand while describing what he had seen and his conversations with other staff members. During the pandemic, Prof Fong, a consultant anaesthetist, conducted around 40 visits of the “hardest hit” intensive care units on behalf of NHS England to offer peer support to the doctors and nurses working there. He wrote reports which were sent back to senior managers including England’s chief medical officer Prof Sir Chris Whitty. He said the “scale of death” was “very difficult to capture in the figures”. “It was truly, truly astounding… We had nurses talking about patients ‘raining from the sky’, where one of the nurses told me they got tired of putting people in body bags. ” “We went to another unit where things got so bad they were so short of resources, they ran out of body bags and instead were stuck with nine-foot clear plastic sacks and cable ties. ” “These are people who are used to seeing death but not on that scale and not like that. ” Prof Fong said that “despite the best efforts of everyone in the system” the surge of demand for healthcare caused by Covid meant it was “not possible to deliver the standard of care that would ordinarily be expected. ” He described the situation as the worst he had witnessed: “I was on the scene of the Soho bombing in 1999, I worked in the emergency department during the 7th July suicide bombing with the helicopter medical service. And nothing I saw during all of those events was as bad as really Covid was every single day for every single one of these hospitals through the pandemic surges. “It’s painful now because it was very clear what was happening to the patients, it was very clear what was happening to the staff. The staff were very injured by just how overwhelmed they were by the whole thing. ” In December 2020 as Covid rates were rising again across the UK, he said he was asked to visit an unnamed hospital with a medium-sized intensive care unit. “I’ll never forget it,” he said. “It was a scene from hell. ” “This was a hospital in massive, massive trouble…. there were so few staff that some of the nurses had chosen to either use the patient commodes [or] wear adult diapers because there was literally no one to give them a toilet break,” he added. “This was a hospital breaking at the seams. ” At the end of his evidence, he was thanked by the inquiry’s chairwoman Baroness Hallett who said “it was obvious how distressing it was for you and reliving such an ordeal is never easy. ” England’s chief medical officer Prof Sir Chris Whitty, who was next to speak at the inquiry, said he agreed with the evidence “very powerfully laid out” by Prof Fong. He said that NHS hospitals in England entered the pandemic in early 2020 with a “very low” level of beds in intensive care compared to similar high-income countries. “That’s a political choice. It’s a system configuration choice, but it is a choice,” he told the inquiry. “Therefore, you have less in reserve when a major emergency happens, even if it’s short of something of the scale of covid. ” Sir Chris suggested that countries like the UK had no alternative but to impose lockdown and other social restrictions to avoid a “catastrophic” amount of pressure on the healthcare system. He accepted that “in many individual cases” doctors and nurses found the situation “incredibly difficult” but said without lockdown restrictions “the expectation is it would have got worse. Not a trivial amount worse, but really quite substantially worse”. Asked about PPE for healthcare workers, Sir Chris said that messaging around which masks NHS staff should wear was “confused” at the start of the pandemic, leading to an “erosion of trust”. He suggested that more research was needed to see if a higher grade FFP3 mask offered more protection than a basic surgical mask in real-life hospital use, rather than in a laboratory. “The question is what happens when people are using it day-in and day-out in operational circumstances, and if it doesn’t hold up in that situation, it’s not doing a heck of a lot of good,” he said. In a future pandemic, he said he would give healthcare workers the choice of which mask to wear “within reason”. "

He said the “scale of death” was “very difficult to capture in the figures”. “It was truly, truly astounding… We had nurses talking about patients ‘raining from the sky’, where one of the nurses told me they got tired of putting people in body bags. ” “We went to another unit where things got so bad they were so short of resources, they ran out of body bags and instead were stuck with nine-foot clear plastic sacks and cable ties. ” “These are people who are used to seeing death but not on that scale and not like that. ” Prof Fong said that “despite the best efforts of everyone in the system” the surge of demand for healthcare caused by Covid meant it was “not possible to deliver the standard of care that would ordinarily be expected. ” He described the situation as the worst he had witnessed: “I was on the scene of the Soho bombing in 1999, I worked in the emergency department during the 7th July suicide bombing with the helicopter medical service. And nothing I saw during all of those events was as bad as really Covid was every single day for every single one of these hospitals through the pandemic surges. “It’s painful now because it was very clear what was happening to the patients, it was very clear what was happening to the staff. The staff were very injured by just how overwhelmed they were by the whole thing. ” In December 2020 as Covid rates were rising again across the UK, he said he was asked to visit an unnamed hospital with a medium-sized intensive care unit. “I’ll never forget it,” he said. “It was a scene from hell. ” “This was a hospital in massive, massive trouble…. there were so few staff that some of the nurses had chosen to either use the patient commodes [or] wear adult diapers because there was literally no one to give them a toilet break,” he added. “This was a hospital breaking at the seams. ” At the end of his evidence, he was thanked by the inquiry’s chairwoman Baroness Hallett who said “it was obvious how distressing it was for you and reliving such an ordeal is never easy. ” England’s chief medical officer Prof Sir Chris Whitty, who was next to speak at the inquiry, said he agreed with the evidence “very powerfully laid out” by Prof Fong. He said that NHS hospitals in England entered the pandemic in early 2020 with a “very low” level of beds in intensive care compared to similar high-income countries. “That’s a political choice. It’s a system configuration choice, but it is a choice,” he told the inquiry. “Therefore, you have less in reserve when a major emergency happens, even if it’s short of something of the scale of covid. ” Sir Chris suggested that countries like the UK had no alternative but to impose lockdown and other social restrictions to avoid a “catastrophic” amount of pressure on the healthcare system. He accepted that “in many individual cases” doctors and nurses found the situation “incredibly difficult” but said without lockdown restrictions “the expectation is it would have got worse. Not a trivial amount worse, but really quite substantially worse”. Asked about PPE for healthcare workers, Sir Chris said that messaging around which masks NHS staff should wear was “confused” at the start of the pandemic, leading to an “erosion of trust”. He suggested that more research was needed to see if a higher grade FFP3 mask offered more protection than a basic surgical mask in real-life hospital use, rather than in a laboratory. “The question is what happens when people are using it day-in and day-out in operational circumstances, and if it doesn’t hold up in that situation, it’s not doing a heck of a lot of good,” he said. In a future pandemic, he said he would give healthcare workers the choice of which mask to wear “within reason”. "

    "body": "2024/09/26 - Experts revealed that The chair of the Covid inquiry has refused an application from the UK Health Security Agency to keep the identities of two junior clinicians secret. Lawyers for UKHSA applied for an order preventing publication of their names, on the grounds they could be subject to abuse and harassment on social media and in person. Both individuals attended Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) Cell meetings to discuss the guidance on masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic. Baroness Hallett ruled their names could be published in minutes of those meetings, as any risk was outweighed by the public interest in reporting on the group’s work. From February 2020 until it was disbanded in 2022, guidance on the use of PPE in healthcare settings was drawn up by the IPC Cell, a group of clinicians and officials from the NHS, government and public-health bodies such as Public Health England, which then Health Secretary Matt Hancock replaced with UKHSA in 2021. Critics have said the IPC Cell was too slow to strengthen its recommendations on PPE after it became clear Covid could be spread by tiny airborne particles. The Covid-19 Airborne Transmission Alliance (CATA), a group made up of healthcare organisations and individuals which campaigned for stronger guidance, has called it a “shadowy” organisation with “unclear” accountability structures. UKHSA said the “heated and aggressive” public discourse around the subject meant there was a “high likelihood” junior members of staff could face online abuse if they were named in minutes published by the inquiry. One social media post from 2022 accused the IPC Cell of having “the blood of many innocent Covid victims” on its hands, adding: “We shall not forgive. We shall not forget. ” Another, from early 2022, called the group “psychopaths, pure and simple”. In her ruling, Baroness Hallett said she “deprecate[d] attacks and abuse of this kind on any public servant doing their job”. But work of the IPC Cell was important to her investigation and the public should be able to assess the evidence in full, including the names and qualifications of those involved in meetings. “On balance, I am not persuaded that there is an objective risk of harm or damage to the applicants should their identities be published,” she said. Eight media organisations led by the Guardian newspaper had argued there was a public interest in knowing who had been involved in decision-making at the time. The abuse of scientists, medics and other officials involved in the pandemic response has been a theme running through the Covid inquiry. Last week, England’s chief nurse from 2019 until July 2024, Dame Ruth May, spoke about the impact of “pretty horrible” comments online. “Sometimes you have to make decisions, or be involved in decisions that mean that, on social media in particular, you are vilified,” she said. In June 2023, England’s chief medical officer, Prof Sir Chris Whitty, said in his evidence that abuse and threats aimed at independent scientists could undermine the response to future health crises. He is due to give evidence to the inquiry for the third time later on Thursday. And in November 2023, Sir Chris’s former deputy, Prof Sir Jonathan Van Tam, told the inquiry his own family had been threatened with “having their throats cut” during the pandemic. "

    "title": "New: High-grade masks evidence weak, Covid inquiry told",
    "body": "2024/09/19 - According to new developments, There is only “weak evidence” that high-grade face masks better protected health workers than surgical ones in the pandemic, the Covid inquiry has been told. Prof Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said respirator masks – known as FFP3s – may have performed no better than thin surgical masks in real-life situations. She said there could be “significant harms” from wearing tight-fitting FFP3s, including blisters and breathing difficulties. “If the evidence was strong that FFP3s really protected people, and we saw a definitive reduction [in infections], they would have been recommended,” she said. Not all scientists agree on what has become a controversial issue. The BBC has previously reported on research which appears to show a significant real-world benefit from wearing higher-grade masks on hospital wards. Throughout the first two years of the pandemic, groups representing doctors, nurses and other health workers repeatedly called for urgent improvements to personal protective equipment (PPE), including the wider use of respirators. FFP3s are tight-fitting masks with a built-in air filter designed to block out tiny aerosol particles which can carry the virus. Before they can be used, each wearer must undergo a fit test, to make sure the mask is properly sealed to the face. For most of the pandemic, national guidance across the whole UK said that healthcare workers should wear basic surgical masks rather than FFP3s, except in intensive care or a small number of medical situations. The decision was heavily criticised by some staff with the doctors’ union, the BMA, calling it a “matter of life and death”. National guidance on face masks from April 2020 was drawn up by a group of experts from across the United Kingdom known as the IPC (Infection Prevention and Control) Cell. Its membership included representatives from the NHS, government departments and health bodies, including Public Health England (PHE), the organisation replaced by UKHSA in 2021 in a shake-up ordered by then-Health Secretary Matt Hancock. The inquiry was shown minutes from an IPC Cell meeting on 22 December 2020, just after the new Alpha variant of Covid had been detected, which appeared to show disagreement about the use of higher-grade FFP3 masks. The records quote Dr Colin Brown, now the deputy director of clinical and emerging infections at UKHSA but at the time with PHE, as saying: “Our understanding of aerosol transmission has changed. A precautionary approach to move to FFP3 masks [in all healthcare settings] whilst we are awaiting evidence should be advised. ” However, the wider IPC Cell decided that no upgrading of the guidance was warranted at the time, and NHS trusts were told to continue to supply staff with standard surgical masks in almost all cases outside intensive care. It was not until January 2022 that the advice changed, saying that FFP3 respirators should be available to “all relevant staff” depending on a risk assessment. By that point, the World Health Organization, and other health bodies, had recognised Covid could be spread in tiny airborne particles over distances longer than 6. 5ft (2m), something officials said was impossible at the start of the pandemic. Prof Hopkins, who served as PHE’s chief Covid adviser before moving across to UKHSA, told the inquiry that FFP3 masks offered a high degree of protection in laboratory studies, but the real-world benefits were less clear-cut. “Where we looked at it, and repeatedly looked at it and are still looking at it, the evidence is weak that FFP3s protected more than fluid-resistant surgical masks,” she said. “At the outset, in March 2020, the risks were that we had never asked people to wear FFP3 masks for prolonged periods. “We saw them get ulcers on their faces and having challenges breathing and challenges in being hydrated. ” Asked about the December 2020 IP Cell minutes, which suggested PHE was pushing behind-the-scenes for the wider use of respirator masks in healthcare, Prof Hopkins said that was a “really challenging time” in the pandemic with the UK about to enter a third wave of the virus. “The fact that PHE was giving and airing a different view is an example of [us] not being involved in groupthink,” she said. The Covid inquiry is currently taking evidence about the impact on the NHS and healthcare systems across all four nations of the UK. More than 50 witnesses are expected to appear in this third section or “module”, which runs until the end of November. "

    "title": "Update: Nurses bore the brunt of Covid, ex-chief nurse says",
    "body": "2024/09/17 - It has been recently reported that Nurses bore the brunt of the pandemic, with low staffing levels and difficulties accessing protective equipment, according to England’s former chief nurse. Dame Ruth May told the Covid inquiry the NHS had been understaffed in 2020, in part because of the “catastrophic decision” to cut financial support for student nurses in 2015. Resources had been “stretched”, particularly in intensive care, she said, with a knock-on effect on the care some Covid patients received. And she had been aware of widespread reports of problems supplying personal protective equipment (PPE) in March 2020, including a shortage of plastic gowns that had left front-line nurses living “in fear”. Dame Ruth, England’s chief nurse from 2019 until July 2024, was one of the senior figures who appeared at Downing Street news conferences during the pandemic. She had also volunteered for nursing shifts during Covid, at times working “under the radar” in hospital wards, the inquiry heard. “We were facing some extraordinarily difficult decisions in the very early part of pandemic,” she said. “It was a fast-moving environment - we were seeing [a large] number of cases coming in and deaths like we had never seen before. ” The NHS had entered the pandemic with about 40,000 nursing and midwifery vacancies in England, Dame Ruth said. And she criticised a “catastrophic decision”, in 2015, to replace the grant or bursary paid to student midwives and nurses with loans. It had led to reduction of about 5,700 trainees in England by 2020, Dame Ruth said, which “would have made a difference” in the pandemic. “There would have been less burnout - there would have been less psychological impact,” she said. Intensive-care units came under such pressure during Covid specialist critical-care nurses were responsible for up to six patients each instead of the usual one-to-one ratio. And Dame Ruth accepted that had affected the care patients received, saying: “It was not where we wanted to go… and I know there have been consequences because of it. ” Blanket do-not-resuscitate orders had appeared to have been added to some patients’ records based on either their age or a pre-existing condition such as autism or a learning disability, she told the inquiry, which had been “completely wrong”. Dame Ruth also suggested it had been a mistake for some hospitals to prevent pregnant women from being accompanied by their partners during scans or the early part of labour. The faster rollout of Covid tests would have allowed visitors to come back into hospital earlier and been safer for staff and patients, she said. Dame Ruth also spoke about the “pretty horrible” online abuse she had faced at the time. “The one thing I learned about the whole of this [period], is the importance of integrity - and sometimes that comes at a cost,” she said. “That means on social media in particular you are vilified - [but] I wasn’t the only one. ” The Covid inquiry is currently taking evidence about the impact on the NHS and healthcare systems across all four nations of the UK. More than 50 witnesses are expected to appear in this third section or “module”, which runs until the end of November. "

    "title": "Breaking: Nurses bore the brunt of Covid, ex-chief nurse says",
    "body": "2024/09/17 - Experts revealed that Nurses bore the brunt of the pandemic, with low staffing levels and difficulties accessing protective equipment, according to England’s former chief nurse. Dame Ruth May told the Covid inquiry the NHS had been understaffed in 2020, in part because of the “catastrophic decision” to cut financial support for student nurses in 2015. Resources had been “stretched”, particularly in intensive care, she said, with a knock-on effect on the care some Covid patients received. And she had been aware of widespread reports of problems supplying personal protective equipment (PPE) in March 2020, including a shortage of plastic gowns that had left front-line nurses living “in fear”. Dame Ruth, England’s chief nurse from 2019 until July 2024, was one of the senior figures who appeared at Downing Street news conferences during the pandemic. She had also volunteered for nursing shifts during Covid, at times working “under the radar” in hospital wards, the inquiry heard. “We were facing some extraordinarily difficult decisions in the very early part of pandemic,” she said. “It was a fast-moving environment - we were seeing [a large] number of cases coming in and deaths like we had never seen before. ” The NHS had entered the pandemic with about 40,000 nursing and midwifery vacancies in England, Dame Ruth said. And she criticised a “catastrophic decision”, in 2015, to replace the grant or bursary paid to student midwives and nurses with loans. It had led to reduction of about 5,700 trainees in England by 2020, Dame Ruth said, which “would have made a difference” in the pandemic. “There would have been less burnout - there would have been less psychological impact,” she said. Intensive-care units came under such pressure during Covid specialist critical-care nurses were responsible for up to six patients each instead of the usual one-to-one ratio. And Dame Ruth accepted that had affected the care patients received, saying: “It was not where we wanted to go… and I know there have been consequences because of it. ” Blanket do-not-resuscitate orders had appeared to have been added to some patients’ records based on either their age or a pre-existing condition such as autism or a learning disability, she told the inquiry, which had been “completely wrong”. Dame Ruth also suggested it had been a mistake for some hospitals to prevent pregnant women from being accompanied by their partners during scans or the early part of labour. The faster rollout of Covid tests would have allowed visitors to come back into hospital earlier and been safer for staff and patients, she said.

    "title": "Latest: How many of us will end up being diagnosed with ADHD?",
    "body": "2024/09/15 - It has been recently reported that The number of people taking ADHD medication is at a record high – and the NHS is feeling the strain as it tries to diagnose and treat the condition. Since 2015, the number of patients in England prescribed drugs to treat ADHD has nearly trebled, and BBC research suggests that it would take eight years to assess all the adults on waiting lists. Last year, ADHD was the second-most viewed condition on the NHS website. Concern about this rising demand has prompted the NHS in England to set up a taskforce. So what’s going on and where will it end? Is ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) becoming more common? Are we just getting better at recognising it? Or is it being over-diagnosed? It turns out it’s not just you and I who have been taken by surprise – so have the experts. Dr Ulrich Müller-Sedgwick, the ADHD champion for the UK’s Royal College of Psychiatrists, says: “Nobody predicted that the demand would go up so massively over the last 15 years, and especially the last three years. ” He’s been running adult ADHD clinics since 2007. At the time, he says, there were just a few of them. ADHD is a fairly novel condition – it’s only 16 years since the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) officially recognised it in adults. When considering whether it might keep increasing, Dr Müller-Sedgwick argues that there are two different concepts to consider: prevalence and incidence. Prevalence is the percentage of people who have ADHD – Dr Müller-Sedgwick predicts that will stay pretty steady at 3 to 4% of adults in the UK. Incidence is the number of new cases – people getting a diagnosis. That’s where we’re seeing an increase. He explains: “What has changed is the number of patients we are diagnosing. It’s almost like the more we diagnose, the more word spreads. ” Prof Emily Simonoff echoes this. She is a child and adolescent psychiatrist at the King’s Maudsley Partnership for Children and Young People. She thinks about 5 to 7% of children have ADHD in the UK – and says: “It’s pretty similar across the world, that’s been consistent and it hasn’t actually risen. ” Prof Simonoff agrees that there’s been a “steep incline” in people coming forward for assessment since the pandemic – but says this comes after years of “long-term under-recognition”. She points to statistics on ADHD drugs. She would expect about 3 to 4% of children in the UK to need ADHD medication, but in reality, only 1 to 2% are actually using it. She thinks this shows that we are still underestimating the scale of the issue. Prof Simonoff explains: “I think that’s an important starting point for when we say, ‘My goodness, why are we seeing all these children now – are we over-identifying ADHD?’ We have under-diagnosed or under-recognised ADHD in the UK for many, many years. ” In other words, we can expect more people to be diagnosed with ADHD now because services are playing catch-up. Thea Stein is chief executive of health think tank the Nuffield Trust. She’s got her own description for the recent increase in demand: “the Hump”. She says: “Diagnosis or desire to be diagnosed has risen because of knowledge and visibility – [it’s as] simple as that. ” According to Stein, the most immediate task is getting through the Hump, assessing the huge backlog of people on ADHD waiting lists. Then, in the longer-term, she thinks society will get better at spotting ADHD sooner in children. She hopes this will mean that they get better support from an early age, and take some of the pressure off adult services. She says: “I have real optimism that we will come through this period of time to a much better place as a society. What I don’t have optimism about is that this is a quick fix. ” ADHD might be a new concept, but people struggling to concentrate is an old problem. In 1798, Scottish doctor Sir Alexander Crichton wrote about a “disease of attention” with “an unnatural degree of mental restlessness. ” He explained: “When people are affected in this manner… they say they have the fidgets. ” ADHD goes beyond problems concentrating or being hyperactive, though. People with it can struggle regulating their emotions and impulses. It’s been linked to substance abuse and financial difficulties as well as higher rates of crime and even car crashes. All the experts I speak to firmly agree on one point: it is much better for someone with ADHD to be diagnosed and treated as early as possible. Dr Müller-Sedgwick says there’s a “risk of really bad outcomes”. But he lights up when he describes how diagnosis and treatment can transform lives. He says: “I have seen so many patients getting better, getting back into work or back into education. I have seen parents who were going through family court proceedings who were able to be better parents. “That’s why we work in this field, it’s a really rewarding part of mental health to work in. ” Currently, ADHD treatment revolves around medication and therapy, but there are other options on the horizon. A patch worn by children with ADHD on their foreheads during sleep – connected to a device that sends stimulating pulses into the brain – is on sale in the United States. It’s not prescribed in the UK, but academics here and in the US are working on clinical trials looking into it. Prof Katya Rubia is a professor of cognitive neuroscience at King’s College London – as she puts it, “My work over the last 30 years or so is basically imaging ADHD, understanding what is different in the brains [of people with ADHD]. ” She explains that certain parts of ADHD brains, including the frontal lobe, are slightly smaller and also less active. Prof Rubia is trying to kickstart those areas of the brain, and is working on a study looking at the trigeminal nerve – it goes directly to the brain stem and can increase activity in the frontal lobe. She says: “This is all very new. If we find an effect, we have a new treatment. ” While that is yet to be proven, she does add: “If everything goes well, it could be on the market in two years. ” So, the hope is that, in the not-too-distant future, there will be more ways to treat ADHD without medication. In the meantime, though, the challenge is getting through that “hump” of people waiting to be assessed – with the belief that, over time, the increase in diagnoses should lessen.

    "title": "Update: The junior doctors' strikes may be over. But is trouble ahead?",
    "body": "2024/08/02 - Here’s what you need to know: It had been the NHS’s longest-running and bitterest pay dispute - responsible for hundreds of thousands of cancelled operations and appointments. And then, suddenly, word came on Monday that the British Medical Association was recommending that its 50,000 junior doctor members accept a fresh offer from the new government. It sounded almost too good to be true. And now some are wondering if it might be. Last Friday, just three days after formal negotiations started at the Department of Health’s London headquarters, Health Secretary Wes Streeting laid his cards on the table. It was, he made clear to the British Medical Association delegation, a final offer - a pay rise topping 22% on average over two years in England. The union’s team said they wanted to think about it over the weekend. On Sunday, the BMA junior doctor leaders met and decided that, while it fell short of their demand for a 35% pay increase, this was the best deal they could get. Cue much trumpeting from the government - in her appearance at the House of Commons, Chancellor Rachel Reeves paid tribute to work put in by the health secretary. Mr Streeting had met the BMA joint junior doctor leaders Dr Rob Laurenson and Dr Vivek Trivedi several times before the election - asking them in their last meeting on Zoom to call off the strike they were about to hold in the lead-up to polling day. When he was made health secretary, Mr Streeting immediately called the BMA to set up talks. Two meetings were held with Dr Laurenson and Dr Trivedi in a 10-day period following his appointment - before the formal pay talks started. The health secretary’s hand was helped by the fact the independent pay review body’s recommendations for the 2024-25 pay rise had just landed on his desk, suggesting a 6% pay rise and £1,000 lump sum be given. This allowed him to make an offer which effectively combined two years of pay rises. He topped up last year’s pay award - worth nearly 9% on average - with an extra 4% as well as agreeing to the pay review body’s recommendation for the current financial year. In less than a week of talks, the new health secretary had achieved what the previous government had failed to do over the course of 11 strikes in the previous 18 months. “What’s important is it could be presented as a win-win for both sides,” one source close to the talks said. “The BMA got a big number, while the government only put in an extra 4% above what the pay review body recommended across the two years - that is just one percentage point more than what the Tories put on the table back in December when talks collapsed. ” Defending the deal, Ms Reeves called the costs - around £350m - a “drop in the ocean” compared to the £1. 7bn cost of NHS strikes. That may all be true, but what’s on offer to junior doctors has not gone unnoticed elsewhere in the NHS. A pay rise of only 2% for NHS staff was budgeted for in the funding given to the health service this year. The Treasury has indicated it will cover some of the extra, but perhaps not all. That has caused concern among senior managers running hospitals. “Unless we get additional money to pay for this pay rise we will have to take money out of services and that is not right for the people that we serve,” says Nick Hulme, the boss of Ipswich and Colchester Hospitals.

    "title": "New: The junior doctors' strikes may be over. But is trouble ahead?",
    "body": "2024/08/02 - Let’s dive into the details: It had been the NHS’s longest-running and bitterest pay dispute - responsible for hundreds of thousands of cancelled operations and appointments. And then, suddenly, word came on Monday that the British Medical Association was recommending that its 50,000 junior doctor members accept a fresh offer from the new government. It sounded almost too good to be true. And now some are wondering if it might be. Last Friday, just three days after formal negotiations started at the Department of Health’s London headquarters, Health Secretary Wes Streeting laid his cards on the table. It was, he made clear to the British Medical Association delegation, a final offer - a pay rise topping 22% on average over two years in England. The union’s team said they wanted to think about it over the weekend. On Sunday, the BMA junior doctor leaders met and decided that, while it fell short of their demand for a 35% pay increase, this was the best deal they could get. Cue much trumpeting from the government - in her appearance at the House of Commons, Chancellor Rachel Reeves paid tribute to work put in by the health secretary. Mr Streeting had met the BMA joint junior doctor leaders Dr Rob Laurenson and Dr Vivek Trivedi several times before the election - asking them in their last meeting on Zoom to call off the strike they were about to hold in the lead-up to polling day. When he was made health secretary, Mr Streeting immediately called the BMA to set up talks. Two meetings were held with Dr Laurenson and Dr Trivedi in a 10-day period following his appointment - before the formal pay talks started. The health secretary’s hand was helped by the fact the independent pay review body’s recommendations for the 2024-25 pay rise had just landed on his desk, suggesting a 6% pay rise and £1,000 lump sum be given. This allowed him to make an offer which effectively combined two years of pay rises. He topped up last year’s pay award - worth nearly 9% on average - with an extra 4% as well as agreeing to the pay review body’s recommendation for the current financial year. In less than a week of talks, the new health secretary had achieved what the previous government had failed to do over the course of 11 strikes in the previous 18 months. “What’s important is it could be presented as a win-win for both sides,” one source close to the talks said. “The BMA got a big number, while the government only put in an extra 4% above what the pay review body recommended across the two years - that is just one percentage point more than what the Tories put on the table back in December when talks collapsed. ” Defending the deal, Ms Reeves called the costs - around £350m - a “drop in the ocean” compared to the £1. 7bn cost of NHS strikes. That may all be true, but what’s on offer to junior doctors has not gone unnoticed elsewhere in the NHS. A pay rise of only 2% for NHS staff was budgeted for in the funding given to the health service this year. The Treasury has indicated it will cover some of the extra, but perhaps not all. That has caused concern among senior managers running hospitals. “Unless we get additional money to pay for this pay rise we will have to take money out of services and that is not right for the people that we serve,” says Nick Hulme, the boss of Ipswich and Colchester Hospitals.

    "title": "New: Why we might never know the truth about ultra-processed foods",
    "body": "2024/07/27 - It has been recently reported that They are the bête noire of many nutritionists - mass-produced yet moreish foods like chicken nuggets, packaged snacks, fizzy drinks, ice cream or even sliced brown bread. So-called ultra-processed foods (UPF) account for 56% of calories consumed across the UK, and that figure is higher for children and people who live in poorer areas. UPFs are defined by how many industrial processes they have been through and the number of ingredients - often unpronounceable - on their packaging. Most are high in fat, sugar or salt; many you’d call fast food. What unites them is their synthetic look and taste, which has made them a target for some clean-living advocates. There is a growing body of evidence that these foods aren’t good for us. But experts can’t agree how exactly they affect us or why, and it’s not clear that science is going to give us an answer any time soon. While recent research shows many pervasive health problems, including cancers, heart disease, obesity and depression are linked to UPFs, there’s no proof, as yet, that they are caused by them. For example, a recent meeting of the American Society for Nutrition in Chicago was presented with an observational study of more than 500,000 people in the US. It found that those who ate the most UPFs had a roughly 10% greater chance of dying early, even accounting for their body-mass index and overall quality of diet. In recent years, lots of other observational studies have shown a similar link - but that’s not the same as proving that how food is processed causes health problems, or pinning down which aspect of those processes might be to blame. So how could we get to the truth about ultra-processed food? The kind of study needed to prove definitively that UPFs cause health problems would be extremely complex, suggests Dr Nerys Astbury, a senior researcher in diet and obesity at Oxford University. It would need to compare a large number of people on two diets – one high in UPFs and one low in UPFs, but matched exactly for calorie and macronutrient content. This would be fiendishly difficult to actually do. Participants would need to be kept under lock and key so their food intake could be tightly managed. The study would also need to enrol people with similar diets as a starting point. It would be extremely challenging logistically. And to counter the possibility that people who eat fewer UPFs might just have healthier lifestyles such as through taking more exercise or getting more sleep, the participants of the groups would need to have very similar habits. “It would be expensive research, but you could see changes from the diets relatively quickly,” Dr Astbury says. Funding for this type of research could also be hard to come by. There might be accusations of conflicts of interest, since researchers motivated to run these kind of trials may have an idea of what they want the conclusions to be before they started. These trials couldn’t last for very long, anyway - too many participants would most likely drop out. It would be impractical to tell hundreds of people to stick to a strict diet for more than a few weeks. And what could these hypothetical trials really prove, anyway? Duane Mellor, lead for nutrition and evidence-based medicine at Aston University, says nutrition scientists cannot prove specific foods are good or bad or what effect they have on an individual. They can only show potential benefits or risks. “The data does not show any more or less,” he says. Claims to the contrary are “poor science”, he says. Another option would be to look at the effect of common food additives present in UPFs on a lab model of the human gut - which is something scientists are busy doing. There’s a wider issue, however - the amount of confusion around what actually counts as UPFs. Generally, they include more than five ingredients, few of which you would find in a typical kitchen cupboard. Instead, they’re typically made from cheap ingredients such as modified starches, sugars, oils, fats and protein isolates. Then, to make them more appealing to the tastebuds and eyes, flavour enhancers, colours, emulsifiers, sweeteners, and glazing agents are added. They range from the obvious (sugary breakfast cereals, fizzy drinks, slices of American cheese) to the perhaps more unexpected (supermarket humous, low-fat yoghurts, some mueslis). And this raises the questions: how helpful is a label that puts chocolate bars in the same league as tofu? Could some UPFs affect us differently to others? In order to find out more, BBC News spoke to the Brazilian professor who came up with the term “ultra-processed food” in 2010. Prof Carlos Monteiro also developed the Nova classification system, which ranges from “whole foods” (such as legumes and vegetables) at one end of the spectrum, via “processed culinary ingredients” (such as butter) then “processed foods” (things like tinned tuna and salted nuts) all the way through to UPFs. The system was developed after obesity in Brazil continued to rise as sugar consumption fell, and Prof Monteiro wondered why. He believes our health is influenced not only by the nutrient content of the food we eat, but also through the industrial processes used to make it and preserve it. He says he didn’t expect the current huge attention on UPFs but he claims “it’s contributing to a paradigm shift in nutrition science”. However, many nutritionists say the fear of UPFs is overheated. Gunter Kuhnle, professor of nutrition and food science at the University of Reading, says the concept is “vague” and the message it sends is “negative”, making people feel confused and scared of food. It’s true that currently, there’s no concrete evidence that the way food is processed damages our health. Processing is something we do every day - chopping, boiling and freezing are all processes, and those things aren’t harmful. And when food is processed at scale by manufacturers, it helps to ensure the food is safe, preserved for longer and that waste is reduced. Take frozen fish fingers as an example. They use up leftover bits of fish, provide kids with some healthy food and save parents time – but they still count as UPFs. And what about meat-replacement products such as Quorn? Granted, they don’t look like the original ingredient from which they are made (and therefore fall under the Nova definition of UPFs), but they are seen as healthy and nutritious. “If you make a cake or brownie at home and compare it with one that comes already in a packet that’s got taste enhancers, do I think there’s any difference between those two foods? No, I don’t,” Dr Astbury tells me. The body responsible for food safety in England, the Food Standards Agency, acknowledges reports that people who eat a lot of UPFs have a greater risk of heart disease and cancer, but says it won’t take any action on UPFs until there’s evidence of them causing a specific harm. Last year, the government’s Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) looked at the same reports and concluded there were “uncertainties around the quality of evidence available”. It also had some concerns around the practical application of the Nova system in the UK. For his part, Prof Monteiro is most worried about processes involving intense heat, such as the manufacturing of breakfast cereal flakes and puffs, which he claims “degrade the natural food matrix”. He points to a small study suggesting this results in loss of nutrients and therefore leaves us feeling less full, meaning we’re more tempted to make up the shortfall with extra calories. It’s also difficult to ignore the creeping sense of self-righteousness and - whisper it - snobbery around UPFs, which can make people feel guilty for eating them. Dr Adrian Brown, specialist dietician and senior research fellow at University College London, says demonising one type of food isn’t helpful, especially when what and how we eat is such a complicated issue. “We have to be mindful of the moralisation of food,” he says. Living a UPF-free life can be expensive - and cooking meals from scratch takes time, effort and planning. A recent Food Foundation report found that more healthy foods were twice as expensive as less healthy foods per calorie, and the poorest 20% of the UK population would need to spend half their disposable income on food to meet the government’s healthy diet recommendations. It would cost the wealthiest only 11% of theirs. I asked Prof Monteiro if it’s even possible to live without UPFs. “The question here should be: is it feasible to stop the growing consumption of UPFs?” he says. “My answer is: it is not easy, but it is possible. ” Many experts say the current traffic light system on food labels (which flags up high, medium and low levels of sugar, fat and salt) is simple and helpful enough as a guide when you’re shopping. There are smartphone apps now available for the uncertain shopper, such as the Yuka app, with which you can scan a barcode and get a breakdown of how healthy the product is. And of course there’s the advice you already know – eat more fruit, vegetables, wholegrains and beans, while cutting back on fat and sugary snacks. Sticking to that remains a good idea, whether or not scientists ever prove UPFs are harmful.

For example, a recent meeting of the American Society for Nutrition in Chicago was presented with an observational study of more than 500,000 people in the US. It found that those who ate the most UPFs had a roughly 10% greater chance of dying early, even accounting for their body-mass index and overall quality of diet. In recent years, lots of other observational studies have shown a similar link - but that’s not the same as proving that how food is processed causes health problems, or pinning down which aspect of those processes might be to blame. So how could we get to the truth about ultra-processed food? The kind of study needed to prove definitively that UPFs cause health problems would be extremely complex, suggests Dr Nerys Astbury, a senior researcher in diet and obesity at Oxford University. It would need to compare a large number of people on two diets – one high in UPFs and one low in UPFs, but matched exactly for calorie and macronutrient content. This would be fiendishly difficult to actually do. Participants would need to be kept under lock and key so their food intake could be tightly managed. The study would also need to enrol people with similar diets as a starting point. It would be extremely challenging logistically. And to counter the possibility that people who eat fewer UPFs might just have healthier lifestyles such as through taking more exercise or getting more sleep, the participants of the groups would need to have very similar habits. “It would be expensive research, but you could see changes from the diets relatively quickly,” Dr Astbury says. Funding for this type of research could also be hard to come by. There might be accusations of conflicts of interest, since researchers motivated to run these kind of trials may have an idea of what they want the conclusions to be before they started. These trials couldn’t last for very long, anyway - too many participants would most likely drop out. It would be impractical to tell hundreds of people to stick to a strict diet for more than a few weeks. And what could these hypothetical trials really prove, anyway? Duane Mellor, lead for nutrition and evidence-based medicine at Aston University, says nutrition scientists cannot prove specific foods are good or bad or what effect they have on an individual. They can only show potential benefits or risks. “The data does not show any more or less,” he says. Claims to the contrary are “poor science”, he says. Another option would be to look at the effect of common food additives present in UPFs on a lab model of the human gut - which is something scientists are busy doing. There’s a wider issue, however - the amount of confusion around what actually counts as UPFs. Generally, they include more than five ingredients, few of which you would find in a typical kitchen cupboard. Instead, they’re typically made from cheap ingredients such as modified starches, sugars, oils, fats and protein isolates. Then, to make them more appealing to the tastebuds and eyes, flavour enhancers, colours, emulsifiers, sweeteners, and glazing agents are added. They range from the obvious (sugary breakfast cereals, fizzy drinks, slices of American cheese) to the perhaps more unexpected (supermarket humous, low-fat yoghurts, some mueslis). And this raises the questions: how helpful is a label that puts chocolate bars in the same league as tofu? Could some UPFs affect us differently to others? In order to find out more, BBC News spoke to the Brazilian professor who came up with the term “ultra-processed food” in 2010. Prof Carlos Monteiro also developed the Nova classification system, which ranges from “whole foods” (such as legumes and vegetables) at one end of the spectrum, via “processed culinary ingredients” (such as butter) then “processed foods” (things like tinned tuna and salted nuts) all the way through to UPFs. The system was developed after obesity in Brazil continued to rise as sugar consumption fell, and Prof Monteiro wondered why. He believes our health is influenced not only by the nutrient content of the food we eat, but also through the industrial processes used to make it and preserve it. He says he didn’t expect the current huge attention on UPFs but he claims “it’s contributing to a paradigm shift in nutrition science”. However, many nutritionists say the fear of UPFs is overheated. Gunter Kuhnle, professor of nutrition and food science at the University of Reading, says the concept is “vague” and the message it sends is “negative”, making people feel confused and scared of food. It’s true that currently, there’s no concrete evidence that the way food is processed damages our health. Processing is something we do every day - chopping, boiling and freezing are all processes, and those things aren’t harmful. And when food is processed at scale by manufacturers, it helps to ensure the food is safe, preserved for longer and that waste is reduced. Take frozen fish fingers as an example. They use up leftover bits of fish, provide kids with some healthy food and save parents time – but they still count as UPFs. And what about meat-replacement products such as Quorn? Granted, they don’t look like the original ingredient from which they are made (and therefore fall under the Nova definition of UPFs), but they are seen as healthy and nutritious. “If you make a cake or brownie at home and compare it with one that comes already in a packet that’s got taste enhancers, do I think there’s any difference between those two foods? No, I don’t,” Dr Astbury tells me. The body responsible for food safety in England, the Food Standards Agency, acknowledges reports that people who eat a lot of UPFs have a greater risk of heart disease and cancer, but says it won’t take any action on UPFs until there’s evidence of them causing a specific harm. Last year, the government’s Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) looked at the same reports and concluded there were “uncertainties around the quality of evidence available”. It also had some concerns around the practical application of the Nova system in the UK. For his part, Prof Monteiro is most worried about processes involving intense heat, such as the manufacturing of breakfast cereal flakes and puffs, which he claims “degrade the natural food matrix”. He points to a small study suggesting this results in loss of nutrients and therefore leaves us feeling less full, meaning we’re more tempted to make up the shortfall with extra calories. It’s also difficult to ignore the creeping sense of self-righteousness and - whisper it - snobbery around UPFs, which can make people feel guilty for eating them. Dr Adrian Brown, specialist dietician and senior research fellow at University College London, says demonising one type of food isn’t helpful, especially when what and how we eat is such a complicated issue. “We have to be mindful of the moralisation of food,” he says. Living a UPF-free life can be expensive - and cooking meals from scratch takes time, effort and planning. A recent Food Foundation report found that more healthy foods were twice as expensive as less healthy foods per calorie, and the poorest 20% of the UK population would need to spend half their disposable income on food to meet the government’s healthy diet recommendations. It would cost the wealthiest only 11% of theirs. I asked Prof Monteiro if it’s even possible to live without UPFs. “The question here should be: is it feasible to stop the growing consumption of UPFs?” he says. “My answer is: it is not easy, but it is possible. ” Many experts say the current traffic light system on food labels (which flags up high, medium and low levels of sugar, fat and salt) is simple and helpful enough as a guide when you’re shopping. There are smartphone apps now available for the uncertain shopper, such as the Yuka app, with which you can scan a barcode and get a breakdown of how healthy the product is. And of course there’s the advice you already know – eat more fruit, vegetables, wholegrains and beans, while cutting back on fat and sugary snacks. Sticking to that remains a good idea, whether or not scientists ever prove UPFs are harmful.

    "body": "2023/03/19 - It has been recently reported that Semaglutide is sold as Ozempic for use in diabetes and as Wegovy in weight-loss. You cannot escape the hype around weight-loss injections. Social media is full of before-and-after pictures. They are the source of wild gossip about Hollywood stars, and now the UK’s National Health Service is going to pay for them. You can understand the appeal. Excess weight affects our health and leads to stigma - and the mantra of “diet and exercise” has simply failed for most people. But should we be calling semaglutide, the drug in question, a “miracle” or “skinny jab” when some doctors think it is as controversial as treatments get? Does the hype match the reality? Or are we failing to tackle the causes of obesity and just consigning people to a lifetime of medication? Jan, from Kent, was one of the first people in the world to take part in the trials of semaglutide. It is sold as Wegovy for weight-loss and as Ozempic for diabetes, although some people have been buying this version to lose weight. We all know somebody like Jan, who has tried every diet, and she has been battling her waistline her whole life. Semaglutide mimics a hormone that is released when we eat. It tricks the brain into thinking we are full and dials down appetite so we eat less. Once Jan started having the injections, her relationship with food was so transformational that she told me it was either down to the drug or “I’ve been abducted by aliens”. For the first time she could go into a cafe, see some millionaire’s shortbread and not have her body screaming, “I need one”. Instead it was, “I don’t feel hungry… my body was saying you don’t want it, it wasn’t me using willpower,” she says. The results of semaglutide are undeniable - at least for a while. On average, people who were obese lost about 15% of their body weight, external when taking semaglutide alongside healthy lifestyle advice in a trial. Note this is not a “skinny jab” - 15% takes you from 20 stone down to 17. That study showed the weight came off over the first year and then stabilised for the remaining three months of the trial. We do not know what happens when people take the drug for years. Jan lost 28kg (more than four stone). It meant she could finally enjoy her 60th birthday present - a flight in a Tiger Moth aeroplane, having been over the maximum weight limit before. “I was flying in more ways than one, and boy did I enjoy it. ” Jan after a flight at Duxford Aerodrome in September 2019, which she says would have been impossible before her four-stone weight loss while taking semaglutide The results seem more compelling than your typical diet, which often starts well but then your depleted fat stores signal to the brain to seek food. That is why diets ultimately fail. “More than 90% of people tend to end up back at the weight they were before they started on their dietary journey,” says Prof Sir Stephen O’Rahilly, the director of the Medical Research Council’s Metabolic Diseases Unit. He sees these drugs as the “beginning of an exciting era” where drugs can help people who have “struggled for a long time” with weight that is damaging their health. Jan’s trial concluded, and she was no longer able to take semaglutide. Without the drug her brain was no longer being tricked into thinking she was full. “I was quite upset because the weight was going back on,” she told me - and she was “promising the world” to anybody who could give her the drug. She tried other weight-loss injections, but ultimately chose to have major surgery and a gastric sleeve to reduce the size of her stomach, so she would feel full faster. Jan has “no regrets” and still describes the drug as the “best thing that ever happened to me”. However, her experience is far from unique and the weight gain after coming off semaglutide is swift. The best long-term data we have, external shows people regain two-thirds of their lost weight within two years of stopping. “It’s a drug that seems to need to be kept taken in order to ensure that weight doesn’t return and that’s, for me, a big problem,” says Dr Margaret McCartney, a GP and champion of evidence in medicine. The NHS is offering semaglutide for only two years, which is how long people can access weight loss clinics. Given the weight gain after coming off the drug, it is fair to ask - what is the point? “It’s really pretty awful for many people who are wanting to lose weight, and have struggled usually for years. If you get something that ends up working for you, and then for the NHS to go and withdraw that again, it does seem to me to be a bit unfair,” says Dr McCartney. There are, of course, circumstances where temporarily losing weight may be beneficial. Some surgeries and treatments are only offered to people below a set threshold, for example. It is a new drug and the long-term safety is unknown. Side effects include, external vomiting, fatigue and an inflamed pancreas. Personally, I cannot figure out whether we should celebrate that medicine has produced such a drug, or if it is actually the opposite - that we have failed so badly to tackle obesity throughout society that we now need drugs. “Many of us have been wrestling with that,” says Naveed Sattar, professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow. He comes down on the side of pragmatism. Half the planet is projected to be overweight or obese by 2035, and excess weight is linked to type 2 diabetes, heart disease and some cancers. Cheap calories have “fed into human biology of being tempted by food and overeating”, he says. And many NHS patients “have four or five conditions as a result of their excess weight, and at the moment we pay lip service to it”, he says. Meanwhile government obesity policies in the UK - 14 of them in the past three decades - have not turned the tide, external and that has largely been felt by the poorest people in the country. , external There is a clear link between deprivation and obesity. Dr McCartney argues we need to tackle how the world we live in fuels obesity rather than “expecting” people to put on weight “and then accept a medical intervention to treat it”.

Further concerns are being raised about the impact on people, often young women, who are pressured to look a certain way when “beautiful” is often equated to “thin”.
